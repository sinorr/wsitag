To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .  
Therefore , the motherland has continued to implement the policy of reform and opening up and economic development , enhanced its comprehensive national strength , continued to raise the quality of the people 's life , promoted forward development of cross-strait interactive relations , and strengthened the Chinese people 's cohesive force , thereby playing an active role in peaceful reunification of the motherland .  
The Chinese Government believes that issues like the space for Taiwan conducting external economic , cultural , and social activities which are compatible with its capacity in the international community , the political status of Taiwan authorities , and so on can all be ultimately resolved within this framework , through political negotiations , and during the process of peaceful reunification .  
The White Paper " The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue " has expounded and proved the facts and legal basis of one China , elaborated the emergence and basic meanings of the one-China principle , emphasized that the one-China principle is the basis and prerequisite for the realization of peaceful reunification , expressed the Chinese Government 's attitude of resolutely defending the one-China principle , and explained the propositions on several issues in the cross-strait relations involving the one-China principle and the adherence to the one-China principle in the international community .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
The DPRK 's active efforts to push its multilateral diplomacy , increase exchanges with other countries of the world , create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean peninsula , launch foreign trade and economic cooperation , and speed up domestic economic construction are beneficial .  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
In international relations , China is opposed to the big bullying the small , the strong bullying the weak , and advocates building a new international political and economic order which is peaceful and steady as well as just and reasonable .  
Our country has signed government-to-government agreements on peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 16 countries , including Britain , France , Russia , and Japan , and established economic , technological , and trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions , thus playing a positive role in promoting international cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
Only when a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order is established , can sustained peace and prosperity be realized in the 21st century .  
We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
My esteemed fellow colleagues : Not long ago , the Chinese Government issued the white paper on " the one-China principle and the Taiwan issue . "  In this paper , we reiterated our principle and stance on the Taiwan issue , that is , upholding the one-China principle and the basic principles of " peaceful reunification and one China , two systems , " opposing any attempts of splitting China and permanently maintaining the current state of separation , and not allowing the Taiwan issue to drag on indefinitely .  
The ' repair company that has built up the business through thrift and hard work ' is an outstanding representative of this heroic unit , which has emerged during the period of peaceful construction ; it has an extraordinarily conspicuous record in building the business through thrift and hard work , for which it is famed throughout the army . "  
In the agreement reached on the summit meeting , both sides reaffirmed the three major principles of independence , peaceful reunification , and great national unity , which are not only conducive to both sides improving relations through dialogue , to realizing reconciliation , and to ultimately realizing peaceful reunification , but also in accord with the current requirements of the times for peace and development and are conducive to dispelling the cloud of a cold war over the peninsula and to maintaining peace in northeast Asia .  
With peaceful reunification , there will be reciprocal exchange , mutual cooperation , resources and market sharing , joint development and prosperity across the strait , but we do not want your money , nor collect taxes from you .  " Apart from letting you folks govern Taiwan , you can also take part in the management of China-wide affairs .  It is better than hiding in Taiwan with fear and trepidation , without any idea of the future , is it not ? "  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , persistence in settling international disputes through peaceful means , equality of sovereignty for all countries , respect for the national condition of every country , seeking harmony while reserving differences , and stepping up mutually beneficial cooperation for common development should be continually reiterated , efforts should be made to practice them , and they should be acted on by all countries .  
The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
He said : China is of the opinion that in order to resolve the issue of nonproliferation , first of all , it is necessary to establish a global security environment of stability , cooperation , and mutual trust .  Building a good international environment in which people adhere to peaceful means to resolve international disputes , and all members of the international community can enjoy universal safety will play a positive role in eliminating the motive of some countries to procure large-scale antipersonnel weapons .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational , and new international political and economic order .  
China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational and new international political and economic order .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
China has always devoted its efforts to international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy , advocating efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons .  But we should not ignore the legitimate right of all countries , particularly developing countries , to use nuclear energy peacefully , even less so applying a double standard , to exploit anti-proliferation as the means for restricting and obstructing cooperation by all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
In the great tide of world peace and development , the historical handshake of the Korean peninsula 's leaders from the north and south not only broke through the solid ice and opened the road for the Korean nation 's independent [ zizhu ] peaceful unification , it also created a beneficial environment and conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula , in the northeast Asian region , and the world .  
People generally believe that such a pragmatic approach and a win-win principle employed by both the North and the South will usher in a new dynamic period for exchanges as well as economic and trade cooperation , and lay a solid foundation for enhancing mutual understanding and trust , putting an end to confrontation , and seeking peaceful coexistence and prosperity between the two sides .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
These principles have now become universal standards for country-to-country relations , playing a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the friendship and cooperation among developing countries in general , and they are and will continue to have an important impact on the promotion of the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
As a friendly neighbor of ASEAN and a partner of mutual trust and cooperation , China has had a high regard all along for the positive role that ASEAN plays in regional affairs , respecting ASEAN 's efforts to establish a peaceful , free , and neutral region , supporting ASEAN 's economic integration , and hoping to consolidate and expand the multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in the areas of economics and trade , science and technology , and society , etc . "  
world peace is facing severe crisis .  We advocate that peace-loving people in the world should be enlightened by the fine traditions of Chinese Buddhism , truly work for the cause of world peace , eliminate the factors for war , and create a stable and peaceful international environment , so that sentient creatures can truly live and work in peace .  
To cope with the various challenges facing mankind 's survival and development , people strongly hope for the establishment of a new , fair and rational international political and economic order and the creation of an international peaceful environment that is safe and reliable and enjoys long-term stability and of an international harmonious situation in which countries make their own choices independently and seek common ground while reserving differences .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
The victory in the Qamdo Battle smashed the vain hopes of the imperialists and pro-imperialist forces in Tibet to split the motherland , smoothly opened the door of negotiations , promoted the process of peaceful liberation of Tibet , and laid a foundation for the Tibetan people to shake off the trammels of the feudal serf system and build a new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
China firmly adhered to its peaceful diplomacy of independence and self-determination , strongly advocated multipolarization in the world , and positively dealt with economic globalization .  It actively participated in regional cooperation and worked hard at creating a new international economic order that is fair and reasonable .  It devoted itself to just causes that promoted mankind 's peace and development .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
Fourth , the mutual visits and reunion of separated families of both sides and the fluttering of " flags of both sides on the Korean peninsula " during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games increased understanding between the north and the south , and expressed their wishes of realizing peaceful reunification through self-reliance .  
Both the north and the south have made firm steps toward the relaxation of tension and reconciliation on the peninsula .  Viewed from an historical angle , this is just the beginning of the long road toward peaceful reunification .  With the trend of easing tension and the acceleration in cooperation and exchange , the " agreement on truce " signed during the Cold War period can no longer meet the development and changes of the big trend in the international arena .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
Lin Chong-pin stated : Beijing 's Taiwan policy has been obviously integrated with its strategy , and the basic framework of this policy has not changed and remains to be the " one country , two systems " and " peaceful reunification . "  In the tactical aspect , however , Beijing has constantly readjusted the forms of this policy .  Since July 1999 , Beijing has applied four operational tactics toward Taiwan .  
Cai stated : The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , namely , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , have formed the core of the international law in modern times .  
Addressing the general debate at the 105th Conference of the Inter Parliamentarian Union on 4 April , Jiang Zhenghua , vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , called on the international community to promote the process of political multipolarity , capitalize on the opportunity of economic globalization to achieve common development and prosperity for all countries , and establish a new , peaceful , stable , fair , and rational political and economic world order in the new century .  
If the Japanese young people and children , beginning from thejunior high school textbooks , learn that " the aggression was reasonable , " " thewar was creditable , " and the aggression war was a " need " and was " aimed atterminating the colonial destiny of Asia " from the history " education , " then itis undoubtedly wishful thinking that can never be realized to hope that Chinaand Japan will keep a more peaceful and friendly relationship in futurecooperation and that Asia will enjoy a long-lasting stable environment for itsdevelopment .  
The frequent military reconnaissance activities that the United States have conducted in China 's coastal areas despite the repeated solemn representations from the Chinese Government are never out of a good peaceful purpose , but have an obvious nature of hostility and have posed a serious threat to China 's security and interest .  Meanwhile , these reconnaissance activities have obviously surpassed the scope of " overflight freedom " and violated the principle of " overflight freedom , " as stipulated in the " UN Convention of the Law of the Sea .  
Commenting on the issue of building a new international political and economic order , Jiang Zemin pointed out : The new international political and economic order should be built on the basis of the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence - - mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other internal affairs , equality and reciprocity , and peaceful coexistence - - and other universally acknowledged norms governing international relations .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Numerous facts have proven that US economic development is increasingly dependent on foreign countries and that the more peaceful and prosperous the world is and the more opened and developed the world is , the more it is beneficial to the United States . This all the more requires that the United States and various countries of the world improve their relations and support the peace and stability in the region .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
All sectors of the society , all cadres and the masses must adopt the perspective of the strategy of a strong nation , prosperous people , and peaceful world and fully recognize the extreme importance of protecting and reasonably utilizing natural resources .  Furthermore , protecting natural resources and optimizing the ecological environment must become conscious actions .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
They even slept near the door to fence off cold winds for their comrades .  In peaceful times , Party members took the lead in answering the call of the Party , executing Party lines and completing urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Having sufficient weapons and equipment is merely one of the conditions for ensuring national security , and other important conditions include peaceful and stable cross-strait relations , brisk and active economic development and competitiveness , and a sound and mature democratic political system .  
China wishes to work hard together with peoples from Africa and other countries in the world , and to make new contributions to the construction of a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order , and to world peace and development .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
Raidi pointed out : In Tibet , there is now smooth administration , all kinds of businesses are thriving , the society is stable , people of various nationalities are united , border defense has been consolidated , and people are living in peace and happiness .  Tibet is now in the best period of development since peaceful liberation in terms of social stability and economic development .  
When answering the question " what do you think deserves the most earnest congratulations in the 50 years since Tibet 's peaceful liberation , " 90 percent of the residents ' answer was : the shattering of the yoke of the feudal serfdom .  As a result , a-million serfs have stood up and have been masters of their fate .  They are now living an equal , harmonious , and independent new life .  
In the five decades of constant changes , China and Pakistan have strictly pursued the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , understood and trusted each other , stood and gone through thick and thin together , forged profound friendship , and thus became a model of peaceful coexistence between countries of different social systems .  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
Encouraged by the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and out of the worry about and righteous indignation at the " Taiwan independence " splittist forces ' attempt to split the country , Chinese nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have taken active actions and conscientiously plunged themselves into the powerful current of opposing " Taiwan independence " and division and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland , thus forming a grand-scale upsurge of patriotism .  
Liu Huadi : In the 50 years since its peaceful liberation , Tibet has witnessed a fast development in its education undertakings .  It now has a fairly complete modern educational system encompassing primary education , adult education , vocational and technical education and special education from primary school to university level .  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
On the afternoon of 22 May , patriotic personages of all ethnic groups from all social circles across the region held a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Looking back at the tremendous changes that had taken place in Tibet under the leadership of the CPC over the past half a century , they warmly lauded the glorious practice and the great victory of the party 's policies towards nationalities , religion , and the united front in Tibet .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
In order to bring about peaceful reunification , Mr . Deng Xiaoping on 26 June 1983 elaborated on a six-point proposal : Holding " talks on an equal footing to achieve a third round of cooperation , rather than talks between the central and local governments " , " after reunification , the Taiwan special administration region may practice a social system different from that of the mainland ;  
The social , economic , political , and military moves of any side will affect the reunification of China . The Democratic Progressive Party and Chen Shui-bian authorities are launching the " Taiwan independence " activities and are selling out Taiwan 's interest in collusion with the anti-China forces in the United States and Japan at the cost of making the people on both sides discouraged and disappointed at the peaceful reunification and afraid of the future . 
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
It stands for extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange to put peace and security on a more solid foundation .  " Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
Once one enters the re-education through labor facility , soft and relaxing music greets the ear , and it is suddenly bright before you .  It is exactly like one former " Falungong " member who has already been transformed said : A profusion of trees and grass grow in the yards , and spotted deer , peacocks , doves , and pheasants that are raised there also run all around - - when one casts their eyes around , one sees an auspicious and peaceful atmosphere .  
The two governments agreed to develop bilateral relations of friendly cooperation on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-intervention in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  They also agreed that while maintaining good political relations , efforts would be made to actively open up exchanges and cooperation in other fields , especially in economy and trade .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .  
Since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has made our strategy and countermeasures against this peaceful evolution clear , adhering to the Party 's basic line for the current stage of development , which is composed of " one center and two basic points , " adhering to the guiding strategy that " development is the absolute principle , " practicing a socialist market economy and striving to develop ourselves .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
All the people of China and the rest of the world long for a lasting world peace and for a stable and peaceful life .  They aspire for a fair and rational new international order and for democracy in international relations .  They yearn for common development and prosperity for all and are willing to work together for a better future .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that China and India are two biggest developing countries of the world .  Both of them face the tasks of developing the economy and improving the people 's living standard and need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment .  
and that it is different from the ambiguous and vacillating confederation concept , to be implemented by different stages , that the Chen Shui-bian Administration had proposed in its Mainland policy .  NPRF said that the KMT proposition would be conducive to the gradual creation of a mechanism governing the development of peaceful and stable cross-strait relations .  
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
PRC Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue has said that the OAU has completed its historic mission outstandingly well , and China sincerely wishes that the African Union will form a connecting link between past and future , carry forward the cause and forge ahead , and create still greater glory in building a peaceful and prosperous African continent .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
We have won the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games . This shows that the international community has acknowledged the fact that China is marked by social stability and progress , its economy is prospering , and its people are living a peaceful and comfortable life .  
After the Cold War , Chinese and Russian leaders decided to establish a new type of interstate relationship based on the five principles for peaceful coexistence out of their respective strategic needs for national construction and their common desire to work for world peace and development .  
Now we are happy that the treaty has been signed smoothly .  The peaceful thinking that China and Russia will remain " friends from generation to generation and never be enemy " to each other has been laid down in a legal form , becoming the program guiding the development of bilateral relations .  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
Today 's Tibet is a picture of vigor and prosperity as the economy is developing , society is making progress , the various ethnic groups are united , the situation is stable , the border defense is solid and the people are leading a peaceful and contented life .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
They also had an in-depth exchange of opinions on current major and urgent regional and international issues , thus reaching a broad consensus .  One of the most important results is that President Jiang and President Putin have signed the Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness , Friendship , and Cooperation . The treaty is permeated with peaceful thinking that the two countries will remain friends from generation to generation and never become enemies .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
The people of China and the people throughout the world all long for lasting world peace in the new century , a stable and peaceful life , the establishment of a new international order that is fair and rational , and the democratization of international relations , and they all long to promote common development and universal prosperity and together create a bright future for mankind .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
However , the world is still far from peaceful .  A multipolar world is evolving along a tortuous path , and so is economic globalization .  New profound changes are taking place in the world 's alignment of forces and distribution of interests - - the Chinese people who have won national independence and dignity are faced with acute challenges , and so is the great cause of rejuvenating the Chinese nation in the new century .

Those attending the forum said : President Jiang Zemin 's speech gave a systematic , complete , and incisive explanation on Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " and put forward an eight-point proposal for further developing cross-strait relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .  This fully reflected the determination and sincerity of the CPC and the Chinese Government to develop cross-strait relations and promote the reunification of the motherland and expressed all the Chinese people 's aspiration for reunification .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
On the frequent high-level meetings between China and Russia , Zhu Bangzao said : The strategic cooperative partnership that is continuing to develop between China and Russia is based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the universally recognized norms of international law ; it is a new type of state-to-state relationship that is characterized by non-alignment and non-confrontation and is not targeted at a third country .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .  
Both countries are developing counties ; and it is the hope of our both countries to give form to a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order at an early date .

Dai Wenbin , a professor at China 's Taiwan Research Institute of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences , believes that the " inaugural speech " of the new leader of the Taiwan authorities was actually advocating " peaceful Taiwan independence " .  Judging by appearances , he used beautiful and pleasant sounding words when speaking , which made it appear that he wanted to express a meaning of detente .  
The side of the mainland motherland has also repeatedly expressed welcoming the visits of all the political parties , organizations , and personages from all circles in Taiwan , so as to exchange views and enhance common understanding on jointly opposing " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait relations , and pushing forward the progress of peaceful reunification .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although the international situation has seen profound changes , China will continue to unswervingly pursue the independent and peaceful foreign policy , develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and make joint efforts with other countries to build a just and rational new international political and economic order .  
She said : As a close neighbor of the Korean Peninsula , China has always supported the two sides of the north and the south of the Korean Peninsula to strive for the final realization of independent [ zi zhu ] and peaceful reunification of the peninsula through dialogue and consultations and without foreign interference .  
Over the past 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties , satisfactory headway has been made in the bilateral relations , and no issues pending an urgent solution exist between the two sides , as the five principles of peaceful coexistence has constituted the cornerstone of the kindred emotion between the two peoples .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to establish friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world , including Yugoslavia , on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and to make joint efforts for the establishment of a new , peaceful , stable , just , and rational political order so that mankind will have a better tomorrow .  
Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
The North-South Joint Declaration confirms the basic principles for pursuing independent and peaceful unification on the Korean Peninsula , as well as the direction for seeking unification .  It agrees to realize the exchange of visitor groups of separated families and relatives , and explicitly calls for seeking balanced national economic development through economic cooperation , increasing exchanges and cooperation in the social , cultural , sports , public health , and environmental spheres , and establishing a mechanism of dialogue between the two governments as soon as possible .  
It is the common hope of the international community that the North and South of the Korean Peninsula will show even greater courage and determination in implementing the agreements they have concluded and in eliminating estrangement and confrontation in an orderly and gradual manner through sustained and continuous dialogue and consultation , so as to create conditions favorable to the eventual realization of independent and peaceful unification on the Korean Peninsula .  
As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
In the letter Jiang Zemin reaffirmed that the north side and the south side are major parties concerned in the peninsula affairs , that China actively supports the consistent position of the northern side 's and southern side 's realizing independence and peaceful unification through dialogue and consultations , that China will , as always , continue to make positive efforts to help maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the two parties ' improving relations on the peninsula is in accord with both sides ' fundamental interests and with the common aspirations of the Korean nationality .  He expressed the belief that the meeting would enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides , promote both sides ' exchanges and cooperation in various fields , and ultimately create an excellent opening for realizing independence and peaceful unification on the peninsula .  
He said : The Chinese people cherish friendly feelings toward the Croatian people .  When your country declared independence in 1991 , China rapidly recognized it and established diplomatic relations with it in 1992 .  This was a decision made by the Chinese Government pursuant to its independent foreign policy of peace and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
A strong and stable China is the firm guarantee for a continued success of the principle of " one country , two systems , " whereas Hong Kong as a successful example will make increasing influence on the solution to the Taiwan issue according to the principle of " peaceful reunification based on the model of one country , two system . "  
During the meeting , the five countries ' heads of state exchanged extensive views on the regional situation and on international issues of common interest and reached a broad consensus on building a " big building " for good-neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation oriented toward the 21st century .  
At present , all the five countries are faced with the arduous tasks of invigorating the economy , of catching up with the tide of scientific and technological development , and of coping with the globalization challenges ; hence the earnest desire to have a long-term stable and peaceful environment for construction .  
These principles have been commonly accepted as the norms governing state-to-state relations , and they have played a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the promotion of friendship and cooperation among developing countries .  They have also already played and will continue to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
6 .  The two countries affirm their identical stands on major international issues .  They hold that international relations in the 21st century should be built on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the established norms of international law , and the dominant position on the United Nations in international affairs should be preserved and strengthened .  They advocate that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means , and that relations between states should be developed on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
2 .  On the other hand , an unprecedented great mass fervor in visiting the mainland and conducting cross-strait exchanges has arisen among Taiwan 's political parties , nongovernmental organizations , and representatives of popular will .  This is something really worth welcoming and really heartening because the people on both sides are the forces that will ultimately decide the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .  
In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
His views on winning a peaceful international environment for socialist construction , having diplomatic missions abroad consider foreign governments as their main object of work , doing what China is capable of in providing foreign aid and carrying out foreign affairs industriously and thriftily still have immediate significance until now .  
Their struggle would also bring endless disasters to humankind .  If , on the other hand , these two poles become true " constructive strategic partners " and join hands in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world with concerted efforts , the 21st century will have lasting peace and become the most peaceful century in modern history .  This will be the two countries ' greatest contributions to all humankind .  
It can be said that since the Sino-African relations of cooperation jointly forged and cultivated by the older generation of Chinese leaders and the pioneers of the African national liberation movements have been deeply rooted on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , they have undergone the tests of changes in the international situation and their own situation , and bilateral friendship and cooperation has been continually deepened and strengthened with time . 
There are three basic principles that must be emphasized in establishing a new peaceful , stable , fair and rational international political and economic order : First , all countries should be equal irrespective of their size .  Second , the right of the peoples of various countries in choosing the road of development according to respective national conditions should be respected .  Third , the sovereignty of all countries should not be violated and under no pretext should the internal affairs of other countries be interfered in .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
He said that the following three basic principles must be stressed in establishing a new international and economic order that is peaceful , stable , equitable and just : First , all countries , big or small , should be treated as equal .  
The 21st century is a century in which the cause of space will attain flourishing development .  Under the state 's overall planning and unified leadership , China will select limited objectives , effect breakthroughs at key points , actuate sustained development , and make still greater efforts to explore the peaceful uses of outer space for mankind .  
China respects Azerbaijan 's independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity , as well as the development path of the Azerbaijan people chosen in light of their national conditions .  China is willing to work with Azerbaijan to strengthen exchanges , enhance their friendship , deepen cooperation , and push forward the continuous development of the Sino-Azerbaijan friendly cooperative relationship on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
During the meeting , Ye Xuanping gave a briefing on the achievements in reform and opening up of the motherland 's mainland as well as on the new social look of areas inhabited by the people of the Haka ethnic group .  He sincerely hoped compatriots on both sides of the strait will make great efforts to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese nation , take the culture of the Chinese nation as a link , promote consensus , communication and understanding , and make concerted efforts to promote the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
Supported by foreign anti-China forces , Taiwan separatist forces put up a desperate struggle , and Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] proposed the " two-state theory , " which wrecked the political basis for the steady development of cross-strait relations and seriously threatened the prospects for peaceful reunification .  
Both sides are ready to continue to develop their comprehensive friendly cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields pursuant to the aims and principles of the UN Charter as well as commonly acknowledged international laws and the norms of international relations , on the basis of respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference , equality , mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence .

Hu Yuanshao , the eighth chairman of the European Federation of Overseas Chinese and Ethnic Chinese Mass Organizations and president of the Austrian General Association of Ethnic Chinese , said : An early accomplishment of peaceful reunification by China is the common wish of overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese .

Pan Zhongqian , responsible person of the preparatory committee for Italy 's Association for Promoting China 's Peaceful Reunification , said : The tens of millions of overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese are a tremendous , irresistible driving force for China 's peaceful reunification .  
Shi Sihao , vice president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots , and Tang Shubei , director of the China Research Center for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait , successively visited France in the second half of the year and were both received with the utmost cordiality by fellow countrymen living in France . Practically all the overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese mass organizations in France participated in activities for exchanges and communication with them , giving advice and suggestions for accomplishing China 's great cause of peaceful reunification .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said when interviewed by Xinhua reporters today that in the past year China has achieved gratifying success in actively and steadily promoting relations with the major powers , making every effort to create a stable and peaceful peripheral environment , consolidating and developing relations with the developing countries , and vigorously promoting multilateral diplomacy and regional cooperation .  This has laid a good foundation for China to actively pursue all-round diplomacy in the new century .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .

Both China and Iran face the task of developing their respective economies and need a peaceful and stable international and surrounding environment .  The two countries share many common interests and hold many common viewpoints in terms of international and regional affairs .

When interviewed by the reporter of Hong Kong 's " WEN WEI PO , " an official from a pertinent central department pointed out that six years ago President Jiang made the eight-point proposal for accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland , objectively analyzed the situation with which we were confronted for the solution of the Taiwan issue , and proposed the measures to further develop the cross-strait relations and advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland , which are reasonable , practical , and feasible .  
Cohen , a political figure who has published many poetry books , mentioned that he said on the Shanghai Stock Exchange that as the middle class on the Chinese mainland grows , their middle class will do " what every middle class has done throughout history " : it will seek a greater voice in governing , it will suggest new and creative approaches to national challenges , and it will push for peaceful solutions to international disputes and stable commerce with its neighbors .  
We , Chinese journalists , will , as usual , work together with our counterparts in all countries of the world to make unswerving efforts for establishing a new international political and economic order of being peaceful , stable , fair , and reasonable and for promoting world peace and development .  
By doing so , they disturbed the normal social order , bringing a sharp contrast to the auspicious and peaceful atmosphere of festivity and the happy mood of the tourists on the square .  This touched off intense anger among the masses .  
On the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , we will further develop ties of friendship and cooperation with countries around the world , actively push forward the process of world multipolarization , make efforts to play our proper role in international affairs , and make new contributions to establishing a fair and rational new international political and economic order , preserving world peace , and promoting common development .

The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "

He described this as " a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole . "  He also recognized the popular wish for a " stable and peaceful situation in the Taiwan Strait . "  
If we have steady agricultural development , peasants will live in happiness and rural areas will be prosperous .  If such being the case , the state will enjoy a stable situation and the world will be peaceful .  China 's history has proven this over the past several thousand years .  
Deputy Ping Ziliang , who is a professor of Inner Mongolia Teachers ' University , said : Last year , through dealing harsh blows at various types of serious criminal offenders , the judicial and procuratorial organs played a great role in guaranteeing that the people could live and work in a peaceful and safe environment , and at the same time , they also provided a good preconditions and guarantee for economic development .

But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .

- The Bar Association has accepted the need for a legal regime to regulate the orderly exercise of a citizen 's right to take part in peaceful assemblies and processions .  At the same time , it states that it is a matter of fundamental importance that such legal regime should not be so overbearing as to have the effect of stifling or threatening any exercise of such a right .  
The motion , to be moved by the Secretary for Security , says : " That this Council considers that the Public Order Ordinance 's existing provisions relating to the regulation of public meetings and public processions reflect a proper balance between protecting the individual 's right to freedom of expression and right of peaceful assembly , and the broader interests of the community at large , and that there is a need to preserve these provisions . "  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .

They will bring up their own babies with abundant love , considerate care and the best material provisions they can afford .  
One painting showed a modern woman bedecked in high heels and a backless dress , languidly resting at the feet of another who might have stepped in from the Han dynasty . In another picture , History 's Traces , a peaceful river scene is disrupted by large , fragmented , white pieces of space at the bottom and center . Despite his boldness and originality of spirit , though , Chen still had difficulty in getting himself accepted as more than a cartoonist .  
Today there is yet another " transitional period , " which calls for yet again undertaking deep examination - - only by balancing the wisdom accumulated over time with the flourishing development of material culture from the West can we assure a peaceful and prosperous future for mankind .  
It does the last because it allows ROC citizens to practically comprehend the mainland , and allows the country 's future to be decided by open discussion ; in this way there slowly takes shape a consensus . Given Taiwan 's objective and subjective conditions , there is no way to accept either reunification under Chinese communist rule or absolute independence . It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
Creatures on the edge : With the peaceful sound of distant waves , this stretch of land seems so featureless and tranquil . It is in fact teeming with life , full of colorful small crabs .  
When she writes about her current home , New York ( especially Central Park ) , or about places she has visited such as Alaska or Egypt , the mood is peaceful and unburdened . The world belongs to the creatures of the sky . The music for this world is written as a series of steady half-notes , occasionally augmented by a graceful glissando of eighth notes .  
Through their goggles , a clear and peaceful ocean world spans before them . Group after group of light blue light yellow and light green stony coral grow from the sandy sea bed . Red and green algae are scattered about . Thus begins their trip through this " ocean flower garden . "  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
Santiago is a beautiful city in South America . Whether they come from distant lands like Taiwan , the US and Canada , or from countries close by , few visitors to Chile fail to extol the city . Its climate is pleasant , its fruit plentiful , its scenery lovely , and its people warm and polite . The nation is politically and economically stable , and the society is peaceful .  
It was a beautiful and peaceful place high up in a chilly sea of clouds . There I saw peculiar tree formations such as an elephant 's head thrusting itself out of the wet ground and azaleas in all their red , fuchsia , pink and white glory crowning the summit in November .  
The correct way to treat the dying person before the conscious soul has left the body is to keep the room quiet , and not perform the above actions on the patient , so as to keep the soul peaceful and safe .  
In one of the Dunhuang Caves , you can find yourself surrounded on four sides by the petals of a giant lotus decoration , in which one peaceful Buddha after another sits in front of its own huge lotus petal . Since lotus petals and leaves have unusual shapes , you can always tell when a lotus flower is being depicted no matter if it has been stretched long , pressed flat , or molded into a square .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
We even proposed that during that week , gays and supporters of gay rights in Taiwan wear a different color each day-red , orange , yellow , green , blue and purple-over six days , to express the expectations represented in the gay rainbow banner for peaceful dignity and equal respect . "  
A Miss Chou , who works for a publisher , recalls that when her mother-in-law was close to death , they shoved a thick tube down her throat to keep her breathing , which not only made it impossible for her to give instructions but also twisted her mouth into hideous shapes . It was such a contrast from her usual calm and peaceful visage , and made her look both scared and in pain .  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
Leaving behind peaceful , picturesque Tsaotun , we come to Puli Township , which is a center of art , culture and scenic beauty . Downtown Puli is bustling and appears completely restored , but in the surrounding boroughs and villages many problems still hamper both physical reconstruction and economic recovery .  
In May 2000 a peaceful transfer of power was accomplished for the first time in Chinese history when the Democratic Progressive Party 's Chen Shui-bian took over as president of the Republic of China . In his inaugural address , he stressed that the country was founded based on respect for human rights . Then in October of that year he formally established an advisory committee on human rights chaired by Vice President Annette Lu .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
Chiu held onto a spirit of " releasing the spirit tied up by the cities and returning to the peaceful , simple life of the country . " Putting features of Taiwanese scenery-whether from Lanyu , Penghu , or Chiufen-into his paintings , he came at his topics from a critical angle . Rather than making comparisons about beauty or ugliness , he relied on inner feeling-taking his melancholy and concerns about the transformation of the local landscape and revealing them for everyone to see on his canvases .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .

Ensuring a modicum of the sense of individual , local and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions .  
Our Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , also deserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and just and sustained by an equitable economic order .  
We trust that , with his vision , wisdom and unique statesmanship , he will ably guide South Africa into a peaceful , stable and prosperous future .  We are confident that South Africa has a dynamic role to play in the community of free States .  
The areas of concern included efforts to bring an effective end to public violence and intimidation and to help to create a climate conducive to negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic nonracial and united South Africa .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
It was also stressed that the planned withdrawal of ONUMOZ was contingent on the holding of peaceful , free and fair elections , the timely announcement of the results of the elections and the subsequent establishment of the new Government .  
New democracies virtually everywhere are confronting the common challenge of ensuring the peaceful processes of political transformation , the establishment and consolidation of internal democratic institutions and norms , and structural readjustment accompanied by socially oriented economic transformations backed up by a system of measures and guarantees for social justice in society .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The view was expressed that an international legal regime dealing with issues related to the dual use of military satellites and non-discriminatory access to the information obtained from such satellites should be elaborated and that such an instrument would promote the peaceful uses of outer space and the maintenance of outer space for peaceful purposes .  
Keep peacemaking as proposed clearly in its basic tradition , the peaceful settlement of disputes , as foreseen in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations , in contrast to peace enforcement , which is perceived as a projection of provisional measures as defined in Chapter VII , Article 40 , of the Charter in respect to breaches of the peace and acts of aggression , but where both proposals are distinct permanent mechanisms to meet new challenges of the times .  
During the past half century the United Nations , as no other international organization , has acquired credibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace , as a mediator and active participant in the peaceful settlement of conflicts , and as a champion of human rights .  
Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
Morocco , which opted for dialogue as a fundamental principle in its policy vis - - vis its neighbours , propounded that principle in international forums as the best means of avoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by peaceful means , remains convinced that its historical ties with Spain , coupled with the two countries ' common economic interests , will help overcome the difficulties that stand in the way of a solution to this dispute . 
To this end Croatia has already proposed to the local Serbs and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , through the good offices of the international mediators , a comprehensive , elaborate and concrete peace plan in the form of a draft agreement on the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Srijem into the constitutional and economic system of the Republic of Croatia .  
Upon signing the agreement on the peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would recognize each other within their internationally recognized borders and diplomatic relations between these two States would be established at the ambassadorial level .  
Moreover , with a view to building a peaceful , prosperous and modern nation , my Government has formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in the political , economic and social spheres .  
This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
It is an encouraging sign that the international community , through the United Nations , the OAU and the Commonwealth , is just as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling Council Government to see an early end to our destructive war so that our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live in an environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage in their ordinary daily pursuits .  
Thus , for those who believe that the African is less than human or is incapable of governing himself , the existence for almost a century and a half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with strong economic potential is undesirable .  
When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
Under such circumstances , the Court , fully aware of its responsibilities as an integral part of the system of peaceful settlement of international disputes established under the Charter , has displayed judicial realism and has considered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties closer together , while not at any time departing from its primary task of applying the law .  
Peace can only be maintained by observing such norms governing international relations as respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , and by establishing , in accordance with the United Nations Charter , a new international political and economic order that is just and fair .  
Nevertheless , these operations can not be transformed into the Organization 's priority objective ; rather , the essential part of the activities of the United Nations must focus on preventing conflicts that affect international peace and security , and to this end its role as a forum for ongoing dialogue where disputes are discussed and resolved by peaceful means needs to be strengthened .  
If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
The Agency 's role as a centre for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was confirmed , and the IAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority responsible for verifying compliance with safeguards agreements .  
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
The challenge for the Agency in this connection is to keep providing credible assurances on States Parties ' compliance with their non-proliferation commitments in an increasingly volatile international security environment and amidst a rapid quantitative increase in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and constant advances in nuclear technology .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us , from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya , with the assistance of United States authorities . 
Today we can say that in the 1990s , with the end of the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism , an unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the course of history and , for the first time , to secure the values of a democratic , just , peaceful , civil and reconciled society , with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed will of the people .  
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
Understood as a value which encompasses universal pluralism and a genuine acceptance of cultural diversity , the idea of tolerance represents , first of all , a valuable intellectual and practical framework within which the vitally important norms of a good society and a peaceful world can be developed .  
Moreover , the shared approaches that have characterized these last few years do not in themselves resolve many of the substantive problems of the international system , such as those pertaining to collective security , economic and social development and the defence of the perennial values that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life for peoples and individuals .  
We need to eradicate social and economic inequalities , both nationally and internationally , to create a stable , peaceful and healthy environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
Zainuddin ( Malaysia ) : My delegation echoes previous speakers in welcoming the desire and commitment of Turkmenistan to play a constructive role in the development of peaceful , friendly and mutually beneficial relations with other members of the international community on the basis of the principles of positive neutrality .  
Surely it is more than mere symbolism that the very first resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its first session , on 24 January 1946 , was devoted to limiting the use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes , and to eliminating from national arsenals atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
From the early days of the national division , the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il Sung put forward a number of reasonable proposals for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and devoted all his efforts to their realization up to the last moment of his life .  
The pan-national unified State to be established in accordance with the proposal for reunification through confederation will form a confederated government in which the two regional autonomous governments of the north and south of Korea participate on an equal footing , and will be an independent , peaceful , non-aligned and neutral State that does not depend on any other big Power .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Stressing the growing importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development in current international relations , and recognizing the importance of promoting social and economic development and international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ,  
By helping to sustain a secure and stable environment , UNMIH will facilitate the Government 's conduct of free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections , culminating in the peaceful transition to a newly elected Government in February 1996 .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
We should therefore like to stress the importance of advancing in the creation of a true partnership between the less developed and the more developed , at an appropriate pace , as a crucial step in fostering an equitable and peaceful international system at the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
Many crucial steps remain to be taken to achieve the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of Haiti and to provide for the Haitian people a peaceful and stable future based on democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law and on economic and social justice .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
It needs to be emphasized that a peaceful settlement of the Angolan civil conflict is not only essential for the people of Angola themselves , but also of major importance to political stability and economic development in southern Africa as a whole .  
The brother African country of Angola , long the victim of an unrelenting civil war and of enormously lethal events , has just provided eloquent proof that it is always possible to reconcile warring brothers who want to bury the hatchet the better to work together to build a peaceful , democratic and prosperous nation .  
Calls on all parties concerned to respond positively to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter , which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiation , mediation and judicial procedures , and calls for a fair and impartial trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
States participating in regional arrangements or agencies are encouraged to consider the possibility of using or , where appropriate , establishing or improving at the regional level procedures and mechanisms for the early detection , the prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes , in close coordination with the preventive efforts of the United Nations ;  
Russia was prepared to seek mutually acceptable decisions with regard to security guarantees for the non-nuclear States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , which would create favourable conditions for the development of broad international cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes , taking duly into account the needs of the developing countries .  
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
Azerbaijan has repeatedly given tangible proof of its commitment to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and has based its approach to the solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the generally accepted international norms of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and respect for human rights .  
In the letter of 10 February from its President addressed to the Secretary-General ( S / 1995 / 130 ) and its presidential statement of 10 February ( S / PRST / 1995 / 7 ) , the Security Council demonstrated its continued concern and , above all , its readiness to support additional practical measures and efforts that would lead to a more peaceful and stable Rwanda .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
While there are many factors that have precipitated the present crisis , the principal underlying cause has been the lingering lack of trust and confidence between the parties and the resultant political stalemate for the past three years , leading to fears on the Croatian side that a peaceful political settlement is unattainable and providing encouragement to hardliners on the Krajina Serb side to think that independence or union in a " Greater Serbia " are realistic options .  
On the other hand , it is ironic that a mentality which has attempted to annex the whole island and continues to entertain irredentist designs on Cyprus , in flagrant violation of international law and all norms governing peaceful relations among nations , can feel eligible to interfere with and complain about proposed amendments to existing legislation in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus regarding utilization and ownership of property in the North .  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
We hope that Iraq will soon be in a position to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , so that there will be no need for this mechanism and so that Iraq may resume its regional and international role in the peaceful and positive manner that would enable the brotherly people of Iraq to overcome the years of hardship and to make up for their losses in the domain of economic and social development .  
Efforts should be made to remove those unreasonable restrictions on transfer of nuclear energy technology so as to help the developing countries master the technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a new international cooperative relationship in the field of nuclear energy .  
Continued engagement and commitment by all Haitian parties to the successful organization of free , fair and peaceful legislative and local elections in June , a crucial step in consolidating democracy , is another key priority .  
" Each State party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide : ( a ) source or special fissionable material , or ( b ) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use , or production of special fissionable material , to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes , unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this article ( IAEA safeguards ) . "  
I have the honour to forward to you the text of a paper providing information on the activities and views of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the three underlying objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons : to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons ; to provide a sound basis for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ; and to encourage negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to disarmament .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Russian Federation remains faithful to the principles of equitable international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and providing assistance to developing countries and regions of the world in satisfying their wishes on the basis of non-discrimination , if they are legitimate and do not run counter to the Treaty .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
Today is the ninth anniversary of the barbaric slaughter perpetrated by the treacherous and aggressive forces of the United States of America and NATO , the anniversary of the loathsome crime committed by the enemies of humanity , who ruthlessly deprived many of life , making women widows , children orphans , and terrorizing peaceful citizens .  
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
Ensuring a modicum of the sense of the individual , local , and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions . "  
Obviously , we all prefer peaceful means , but when brutal force is used the Secretary-General must have the right to use the resources available to him , in consultation with the relevant troop contributors , as stated in this resolution , to employ our resources in the most effective manner possible to meet the humanitarian needs of so many desperate Bosnian citizens and to achieve a lasting peace .  
Calls on all parties concerned to positively respond to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiations , mediation and legal procedures in conformity with international law and calls for a fair trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;

Commends the people of Haiti for their peaceful participation in the first round of municipal and legislative elections and calls upon the Government and political parties in Haiti to work together to ensure that the remaining municipal and legislative elections and the presidential elections to be held at the end of this year are conducted in an orderly , peaceful , free and fair manner , in accordance with the Haitian Constitution ;  
Ensuring the backstopping of essential human freedoms such as acceptably peaceful and equitable political , economic and social environments that promote individual , local and national security .  
Faced with the joint and highly coordinated offensive military activities of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs , and the growing interference of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , the Republic of Croatia presented the Croatian Serb leaders with a clear choice : to accept immediately the principles of peaceful reintegration or face police and military action aimed at restoring Croatian sovereignty over its occupied territories .  
Let us hope that this is the last time never again the world will watch these sad pictures , directed for us by those who for more than three years pulled the leg of very cooperative and acquiescent representatives of the international community by rejecting all initiatives for solving the crisis in Croatia and for the peaceful reintegration of Krajina into the sovereign and independent State of Croatia .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
As far as Croatia is concerned such peaceful settlements imply complete restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders , with full guarantees of minority rights given to the Serbian ethnic community in Croatia accompanied , should there be a need , by international monitoring .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice .  
It is inexplicable and hypocritical that the NATO aggression should come at a time when negotiations are in progress and when major steps are made along the road to the ultimate peaceful resolution , in the name of peace and the United Nations , which have been created with a goal of assisting and protecting the peoples who are endangered and not to give in to the militants implicated even in the war crimes .  
The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
However , the coexistence of different groups is not always peaceful , and problems relating to minorities are today one of the major sources of international and internal conflicts involving widespread and at times massive human rights violations with severe repercussions for the peace and stability of the community of nations .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Ukraine takes the view that the balanced and constructive position of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , backed by specific practical measures , raises the urgent question of the essential need to lift the Security Council sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , since that is an integral part of the process of a comprehensive peaceful settlement in the Balkans .  
Some leading representatives of the international community pointed out on more than one occasion that it was operation " Storm " that changed the strategic balance in the former Yugoslavia and paved the way for the negotiated peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas of Croatia and a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
has been emphasized in Security Council resolution 1023 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the transitional administration is to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the region into the Croatian legal and constitutional system following four years of war and hostility , which have created deep apprehension , fear and distrust between the Croatian Government and the local Serbs .  
In view of the obvious link between human rights violations , the mass displacement of persons and the emergence of threats to international peace and security , Russia agreed with UNHCR that human rights monitoring must be one of the preventive measures included in plans for United Nations peace-keeping activities and in negotiations on peaceful settlement of disputes , and that safeguarding human rights was closely linked to the protection of refugees .  
the meeting of heads of State of the subregion held in Addis Ababa in 1992 with a view to seeking a lasting solution to that human tragedy , it had been recognized that the only way of finally resolving the problem was not simply through achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts but also , and above all , through improving the economic situation of the countries concerned . 
The standards on indigenous rights to be elaborated by the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights should promote peaceful and constructive solutions based on the principles of multicultural societies , inter-ethnic understanding and harmony and tolerance .  Respect for the rights of indigenous people did not prejudice the territorial integrity of States , but strengthened it and prevented violent conflicts .  
that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; and denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
Government looked to the Chinese Government to take specific steps to conform to international human rights norms , including releasing persons detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions and preserving the unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage of Tibet .  
included harmony among the various national groups and political stability based on the equal rights of all citizens , the unity of its multinational people and the resolution of all State issues through peaceful , democratic means .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
that end , the Supreme Council called on the international community to maintain the pressures on the Iraqi Government until Iraq gave proof of its peaceful intentions and completed implementation of the provisions of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other pertinent United Nations resolutions , in particular those relating to the release of prisoners and detainees , both Kuwaitis and nationals of other States , whose extended suffering was in blatant violation of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and the third and fourth Geneva Conventions .  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .  
As I stated on a previous occasion , Bolivia is of the view that many conflict situations can be explained by the persistence of unresolved social and national problems , as well as by the accumulation of age-old injustices and resentments ; by geopolitical and economic interests that for decades have been fuelling confrontation from without and from within ; and , above all , by Governments ' inability to cooperate effectively so as to provide timely and peaceful solutions to the problems of greatest national concern . 
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
We also call upon Iran to respond to the peace initiatives we have advanced and which are supported by sisterly and friendly peace-loving countries ; to enter into unconditional bilateral negotiations conducive to a peaceful settlement of the dispute ; or to refer the case to the International Court of Justice .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
The qualitative developments that have taken place in Mali 's northern regions show clearly the determination of Mali 's young democracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a concerted and peaceful way , with the active participation of all players and with scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
It has played a significant , discernible and indispensable role in human affairs , from the peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to economic development and social progress , from food and agriculture to employment and labour standards , from helping the children of our world to fostering human rights and justice .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
The presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable opportunity to review the work which the Agency has carried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of its activities in the various fields in which it operates in accordance with its statutory functions , both in respect of its work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , as well as in the strengthening of international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
Fourthly , bearing in mind the major aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our country 's economic and social development , we would once more like to stress that our country is supporting the Agency 's measures for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime , within the context of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
We are grateful to all Member States that supported our appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal respect of international law as reflected , for instance , in General Assembly resolution 49 / 43 , which created the political conditions and legal framework for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia .  
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
Although 1996 began on a promising note with the peaceful and democratic general elections held in Palestine on 20 January , a series of devastating terrorist attacks against Israel in late February and early March quickly enveloped the spirit of optimism surrounding the peace process in a sombre and cynical cloud .  
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
It is therefore gratifying to note from his latest report , contained in A / 51 / 390 , that Antarctica continues to play a critical role as a centre for scientific programmes and for peaceful cooperation among States and in improving our understanding of its environment and its dependent and associated ecosystem .  
In bringing this case to your esteemed organization , the Republic of Yemen - while assuring your organization and all fraternal African States of its willingness to negotiate on the subject of Eritrea 's claims and to achieve a just , comprehensive and peaceful settlement of the entire maritime boundary between it and Eritrea - calls upon Eritrea to bear the full consequences of its acts of hostility against Yemen .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Such problems include breaches of basic discipline such as the non-wearing of uniforms and lack of proper identification on vehicles ; the bearing of arms while off duty ; the disproportionate use of force in carrying out police duties ; lack of experience in the legitimate use of firearms ; inappropriate methods of crowd control ; and insufficient use of techniques for the peaceful settlement of disputes .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The Republic of Tajikistan has consistently adhered to the policy of settling the inter-Tajik conflict through exclusively peaceful , political means and , in fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of all citizens of Tajikistan for a comprehensive peace and calm in the country , is taking an active position at the inter-Tajik talks being held in Ashkhabad and is putting forward new and constructive proposals .

Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; forced displacement of persons ; enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; and denial of the freedoms of expression , association and peaceful assembly ;  
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
To appeal to international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;  
It stands against the letter and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement , recognized by the international community as the legal binding instrument to preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula until it will be replaced - hopefully in the near future - by a peaceful settlement agreed upon by all sides involved .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
The Ministers reiterated their call to the Iranian Government to end its occupation of the islands , to desist from pursuing a policy of imposing faits accomplis by force , to halt the adoption of unilateral measures , to remove the effects of any unilateral measures taken or any installations built , to adopt peaceful means of resolving the ongoing dispute in accordance with the principles and norms of international law , and to agree to the referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice .  
Indeed , the English occupation in 1765 had been partial and precarious ; the fact that they had left tangible signs of possession to indicate their intention of returning could not constitute a legal claim that was more compelling than the continuous , effective and peaceful exercise of State sovereignty over the entire archipelago for many years .  
Considering the Security Council sanctions an inalienable and integral part of the international efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia , Ukraine has complied with all United Nations resolutions concerning the obligatory trade and economic embargo against the FRY and has taken appropriate measures on a national level to ensure their observance .  
The major changes in the world , which have eliminated confrontation between blocs , have already had an impact on the situation in the Mediterranean region , where the outlines of a peaceful future are beginning to take shape : the Middle East peace process is proceeding , although with considerable difficulty ; the move towards peace in the Balkans is continuing ; and there is a growing understanding of the importance of establishing regional cooperation for economic growth and rescuing the environment of the Mediterranean basin . 
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
While urging the United Nations to take the necessary steps to halt the irresponsible actions of the United States Administration , which can only reduce the Organization 's role to insignificance and destroy the peaceful basis on which international relations are built , the Government of the Republic of Iraq holds the United States Government fully accountable before international law for any consequences its aggressive and unlawful positions vis - - vis Iraq may have . 
The emergency joint meeting adopted a decision on taking strong countermeasures in response to the dangerous manoeuvre of the Kim Yong Sam cliques who are misusing the recently occurred accident during a training mission , aggravating the north-south confrontation and driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in succession to the brutal crackdown on the peaceful unification events organized by the students of " Han Chong Ryon " of south Korea on 15 August 1996 by unreasonably relating those to us . 
Because of the obstacles experienced and the serious hindrances caused by the Israeli leadership 's failure to respect its commitments , our Council must today face the logical results of such a situation and of the Israeli attitude , which differs greatly from what the international community has set down as the fundamental principles for a peaceful , comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict .  
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .

Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
It further states that " the will of the people shall be the basis of authority of government " , and that " this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures " . 7 It also declares the right to equality before the law , to freedom of opinion and expression , and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association .

Liechtenstein first introduced in 1991 an initiative on the right of self-determination , the ultimate goal of which is to enable States facing internal problems be they between the central Government and communities or between communities within States to cope with these problems in a peaceful and flexible manner on the basis of international law and through constructive dialogue . 
With that perception , we believe that it is high time to completely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past , namely , the imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations , sanctions and embargoes , and so forth , which distort international relations , cause suffering to the people and seriously violate the minimum right of human beings the right to a peaceful life .

Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .

As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
In view of the grave consequences of a possible intensification of military confrontation , the Polish delegation shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his report that it is necessary to increase and coordinate international efforts to impress upon the Afghan parties the need to solve the conflict in a peaceful way , that is to arrive at a lasting political settlement with the participation of all segments of Afghan society .  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;

To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
While the warring parties have shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it is noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans have taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who are not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
Whereas the Oslo , Washington and Cairo accords raised hopeful prospects for a just and lasting peaceful solution leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital , the new Israeli Government has embarked on a policy of colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories with the aim of creating situations of fait accompli on the ground .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .

For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The Secretary-General added , however , that while the warring parties had shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it was noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans had taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who were not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Bosnia and Herzegovina has the sad distinction of having numerous conferences and debates focused on its tragic destiny among them those of the Security Council aimed at finding a fair and peaceful settlement of the conflict tearing it asunder .  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
While speaking in favour of a peaceful settlement of the conflict at the earliest possible date , the Republic of Armenia received , during the period 1993 to 1996 , a vast amount of Russian weaponry , far exceeding its requirements , including tanks , armoured vehicles and SCUD missiles , worth $ 1-billion .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
We are witnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance , violence and non-respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; incitements to hatred are spreading to many corners of the planet ; many peoples are still oppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of freedom ; and international disputes which must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means , in accordance with the San Francisco Charter are continuing , imperilling peace and security .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
With regard to the overlapping claims by neighbouring States with adjacent or opposite coasts over exclusive economic zones or continental shelves , the Chinese Government is in favour of seeking proper solutions through peaceful negotiations in accordance with well - established international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
Regarding existing disputes , it is our view that they should be settled through peaceful negotiations in a spirit of equality , mutual understanding and respect for each other 's sovereignty and jurisdiction over respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones , in accordance with international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .

It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
Since the ultimate objective of these measures is to undermine international peace and security and create political and economic instability in other countries , the Islamic Republic of Iran , like other members of the international community , advocates the removal and elimination of all economic and trade embargoes imposed upon Cuba , and believes that differences between States should be settled in a peaceful manner .  
Let me refer to the European Union Common Position of 2 December 1996 , and reiterate on this occasion that the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
By the same token , my delegation abstained in the separate vote on the third preambular paragraph , as we have done in corresponding cases in previous years , because it is our view that the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an inalienable right of all States and therefore can not be made conditional on whether or not one is a party to certain international treaties .  
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .  
In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
The proliferation of conflicts , internal as well as international , of which civilian populations are the innocent victims , can only reaffirm to us the need to work towards the ideal embodied in that tradition by encouraging States , in conformity with the United Nations Charter , to resolve their differences through peaceful means .  
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .  
The five principles of peaceful coexistence make up the political foundation underpinning world peace ; mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity constitute the economic guarantee for world peace ; dialogue , consultations and negotiations between the parties concerned on an equal footing represent the correct approach to resolving disputes and safeguarding peace.In this context , we call on the international community to take this new security concept as a guideline .  
In order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , States Parties to the Treaty conducting activities in outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , agree to inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as the public and the international scientific community , to the greatest extent feasible and practicable , of the nature , conduct , locations and results of such activities .  
Mr . Tarabanov ( Bulgaria ) stated that the treaty , as a legal instrument designed to stimulate international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful utilization of outer space , was a historic achievement ; it was not , however , an end in itself but a promising beginning . . . .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The Committee was fully aware of the delicate situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of efforts by numerous Governments , SADC , OAU , the Security Council and the Secretary-General to find a peaceful solution to a crisis which was likely to set the entire African continent aflame .  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
They included observing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , especially the principles of State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States ; following the three basic principles guiding peacekeeping operations , namely the consent of the parties concerned , strict neutrality and non-use of force except in self-defence ; and settling disputes through peaceful means , such as good offices , mediation and negotiation .  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
He stressed the importance of the fundamental principles underlying international negotiations , namely , respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States , refraining from the threat or use of force , the peaceful settlement of international disputes , equal rights , self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of States .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The human rights situation left much to be desired in Belarus , especially with respect to freedom of expression : freedom of the press was limited , peaceful demonstrators and journalists had been arrested and beaten , and new media legislation violated international standards .  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
The Chinese delegation has always supported such draft resolutions , for the following reasons : first , we support the promotion of international cooperation for the peaceful uses of science and technology so that they can accelerate the economic and social development of countries , particularly the developing countries.Secondly , export control regimes on dual-use goods and technologies should be set up with the universal participation of the international community .  
Efforts to build a peaceful world , develop national and international cooperation and ensure progress for mankind and economic and social development will not be successful if preventive measures are not continuously taken to combat all forces of war , and all forces leading to the violent disintegration of States .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
With the understanding and support of the international community and motivated by the desire to find real , definitive and peaceful solutions to disputes , we successfully moved forward and created peace and tangible progress for our peoples .  
As indicated in the communiqu of the SADC Summit meeting on the Democratic Republic of the Congo held on 23 August 1998 , the reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as an independent , sovereign , united , peaceful , stable and prosperous country is critical to the achievement of the same objectives in the region and in the rest of the African continent .  
Not only does the use of arms complicate the search for a peaceful resolution of differences , but it is also a source of much human suffering : the displacement of populations , the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures acquired at the cost of great efforts , massive flows of refugees into bordering countries and the sudden spread of disease.This list is not an exhaustive one by any means . 
Recalling that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad _ based dialogue involving all concerned actors ,  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
China therefore opposed any monopoly or militarization of outer space and favoured increased international cooperation in outer space based on peaceful uses , equality , mutual benefit , mutual learning and shared development .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The political process connected with the establishment of special international judicial bodies has been , on occasion , perceived as diminishing the role of the ICJ in the field of the international peaceful settlement of disputes .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .  
A peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication as well as sustainable and equitable development ;  
Recalling that transparent and accountable governance , including in international institutions and organizations , is indispensable for creating an enabling environment for building peaceful , prosperous and democratic societies ;  
To promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of the sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ;  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .

The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .  
Of crucial importance was an adequate national technical , human and regulatory infrastructure in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management for the peaceful application of nuclear energy .  
Acknowledging the key role played by the United Nations under the Charter in the peaceful settlement of international disputes and in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character ,  
However , any individual political idea , even the most noble one , is worth nothing if it does not find room for a common individuals everyday thoughts about daily bread , a roof over his head and the dream of a dignified , quiet and peaceful life .  
The Special Rapporteur asks for urgent national and international action at all levels to combat extreme poverty and social exclusion , whose spread may lead to continued instability that could weaken the peace process and impede peaceful coexistence .  
In connection with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , the vital importance of security in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste is quite evident .  
They pledged to make new efforts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear arsenals , halting the global spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening the essential standards governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
The return of the Serb refugees to Kosovo , in particular , would certainly be a tangible sign of the durable abating of tensions and attainment of the entire international communitys objective of building a peaceful , democratic and multiethnic Kosovo .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee agreed that activities involving international cooperation , such as participation in international scientific campaigns , sharing of satellite data , providing educational and training assistance to other countries and building institutional capacity , should be further encouraged to enable outer space to be explored and used for peaceful purposes .  
As my Government remains unwaveringly committed to defending the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of the country , I would like to reaffirm our strong belief in a peaceful political settlement of the conflict and to reiterate our wholehearted support for the pivotal mediating role of the United Nations , aimed at the establishment of a broad-based , multi-ethnic and fully representative Government in Afghanistan . In this context , the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan already last Friday sent identical letters to the Secretary-General and to yourself , Sir .  
In conclusion , I should like to say that I was particularly impressed and encouraged by the commitment of all sectors and of Congolese people of all persuasions to preserve their national unity ; by the strength and engagement of civil society throughout the country ; and by the resilience and determination of local communities and the youth .  A united , peaceful and vigorous Congo is good for Congolese children .  
Because countries have different social systems , ideologies , value systems and religious beliefs , it is necessary in international relations to strictly abide by the basic principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other States , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence .  
Instead of responding to the repeated calls of regional and international organizations that it take the necessary steps to demonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other neighbouring countries and that it change its political and informational language with a view to establishing an atmosphere of confidence , Iraq at the Arab summit held in Jordan last March rejected the inclusion of a paragraph in the final declaration renewing its commitment to guaranteeing the security and sovereignty of the State of Kuwait . 
To do this , we need to address four major objectives : first , consolidate the secure and stable environment that presently exists ; secondly , steer East Timor through the creation of democratic institutions and successful , peaceful elections ; thirdly , put in place the building blocks for the management of public finances and policy-making ; and fourthly , establish the framework for a sustainable and effective Government administration .  
It is fitting that Ireland , as a strong and consistent supporter of East Timors peaceful transition to a stable , democratic and effective and independent State , is presiding over the Council at this important point in East Timors transition process .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .  
During the period under review , UNMIK was established with broad and complex tasks to provide transitional administration for Kosovo , while establishing and overseeing the development of provisional democratic self-governing institutions to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants of Kosovo .  
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya considered that regional efforts should be focused on ensuring that scientific achievements in the nuclear field were used for peaceful purposes and hoped that a regular exchange between countries of information on the research undertaken would be set up .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
We voice our satisfaction in this regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina has acquired an elected Council of Ministers , whose main objective is to undertake basic reforms on all levels , particularly by advancing the noble values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among all the ethnic groups .  
Recalling that accountable and transparent governance at the national and international levels is critical for the creation of an environment that facilitates the development of democratic , prosperous and peaceful societies ,  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
Recalling that accountable and transparent governance at the national and international levels is critical for the creation of an environment that facilitates the development of democratic , prosperous and peaceful societies ,  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and the increasing commercialization of space activities , it was necessary to identify improvements or mechanisms to strengthen the existing legal framework governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The Argentine people and Government never accepted that act of force and today reiterate , just as in the past , their unwavering determination to regain through the peaceful means of diplomatic negotiations and in accordance with the numerous appeals by the international community , the exercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas , South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas .  
It also points to two defining elements of the philosophy underlying the collective security system : first , preventing armed conflict is a more desirable and cost-effective strategy to ensure lasting peace and security than trying to stop it or alleviate its symptoms ; and second , armed international conflicts are best prevented by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered , as provided for in Article 2 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter .  
Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Deeply concerned that systematic rape , sexual slavery and slavery-like practices are still being used to humiliate civilians and military personnel , to destroy society and diminish prospects for a peaceful resolution of conflicts and that the resulting severe physical and psychological trauma endanger not only personal recovery but post-conflict reconstruction of the whole society , as pointed out in the above-mentioned report ;  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
In conclusion , the Special Representative was particularly impressed and encouraged by the commitment of all sectors of Congolese society to preserve their national unity , by the strength and engagement of civil society throughout the country , and by the resilience and determination of local communities and young people .  A united , peaceful and vigorous country is good for Congolese children , it is good for the development and future of Africa and it is good for international peace and security .  
The full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention must be seen as an urgent endeavour of the international community with a view to eliminating all chemical arsenals , verifying industrial activities using sensitive chemicals , promoting increasing cooperation for peaceful uses , and controlling the international exchange of sensitive chemicals , a task entrusted to the OPCW but regrettably not yet implemented despite the wish of the majority of States parties .  
Kyrgyzstan would like to see the future Afghanistan as a peaceful , neutral and friendly State and also holds the view that it is necessary to ensure in that country the international conditions needed for carrying out the Afghan settlement process on a peaceful basis and achieving national reconciliation by setting up a broad-based , effective coalition government that reflects the interests of the entire Afghan people and maintains good-neighbourly relations with neighbouring States .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
He stated that SRRC was deeply committed to a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Somalia through dialogue and genuine reconciliation , which can enable all parties to reach a satisfactory political solution acceptable to all as outlined in the SRRCs Charter and Political Programme .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
It must be recalled here that the loyal and effective commitment of States to general and complete disarmament must serve to assist their access to sophisticated technology designed for peaceful purposes , with due respect for their choices linked to social and economic development .  
In the social sphere , bridges should be built not only to improve education and train people to live together in a highly competitive world , but to ensure peaceful coexistence based on tolerance , respect and solidarity , as well as strengthening national and international institutions to ensure the changes needed for new commitments .  
Official and unofficial assistance to developing countries must be increased , their debt burden must be alleviated and the conditions governing their access to technology for peaceful uses and the access of their products to global markets must be eased to enable those countries to carry out appropriate reforms of their social and development institutions , diversify their sources of national income , create job opportunities for their nationals , provide education , health and social welfare services and combat chronic and epidemic diseases , especially HIV / AIDS .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
In conclusion , let me reassure the Assembly of my Governments continued commitment to supporting and expanding the Agencys role in international cooperation in the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation for the benefit of all member States . I would like also to express the Czech Republics appreciation for the personal involvement of the Director General , Mr . Mohamed ElBaradei , in the promotion of the Agencys activities .  
Many participants stressed that the process of building a democracy that is rooted in a culture of tolerance and respect for diversity was a crucial element in strengthening the capacity of a State to prevent , manage and settle conflicts by peaceful means , given that social exclusion , intolerance and unequal access to vital resources were often at the root of todays armed conflicts .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting and expanding the exploration and use of outer space , as the province of all mankind , for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Recalling that international law set strict limits on the use of outer space for military purposes , she said that the issue of ways and means of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be studied in depth by all the bodies concerned within the context of their respective mandates . 
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
The nations of the world should continue to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , vigorously promote the Olympic spirit , seek peaceful solutions to international disputes and regional conflicts , enhance understanding and friendship among civilizations through dialogue and exchange , and work for continuous , global , social and economic development through cooperation .  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .  
To build the capacity required to develop and extend its activities in different areas of the peaceful uses of space , including satellite communication , resource investigation and satellite-based positioning systems , satellite meteorology and natural disaster monitoring , space science and technology , the Islamic Republic of Iran is not only currently taking required measures to provide required facilities , hardware and software , but is also extending its educational activities both using national resources and through the implementation of bilateral regional or interregional cooperation projects .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue to intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .  
Therefore , the motherland has continued to implement the policy of reform and opening up and economic development , enhanced its comprehensive national strength , continued to raise the quality of the people 's life , promoted forward development of cross-strait interactive relations , and strengthened the Chinese people 's cohesive force , thereby playing an active role in peaceful reunification of the motherland .  
The Chinese Government believes that issues like the space for Taiwan conducting external economic , cultural , and social activities which are compatible with its capacity in the international community , the political status of Taiwan authorities , and so on can all be ultimately resolved within this framework , through political negotiations , and during the process of peaceful reunification .  
The White Paper " The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue " has expounded and proved the facts and legal basis of one China , elaborated the emergence and basic meanings of the one-China principle , emphasized that the one-China principle is the basis and prerequisite for the realization of peaceful reunification , expressed the Chinese Government 's attitude of resolutely defending the one-China principle , and explained the propositions on several issues in the cross-strait relations involving the one-China principle and the adherence to the one-China principle in the international community .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
The DPRK 's active efforts to push its multilateral diplomacy , increase exchanges with other countries of the world , create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean peninsula , launch foreign trade and economic cooperation , and speed up domestic economic construction are beneficial .  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
In international relations , China is opposed to the big bullying the small , the strong bullying the weak , and advocates building a new international political and economic order which is peaceful and steady as well as just and reasonable .  
Our country has signed government-to-government agreements on peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 16 countries , including Britain , France , Russia , and Japan , and established economic , technological , and trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions , thus playing a positive role in promoting international cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
Only when a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order is established , can sustained peace and prosperity be realized in the 21st century .  
We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
My esteemed fellow colleagues : Not long ago , the Chinese Government issued the white paper on " the one-China principle and the Taiwan issue . "  In this paper , we reiterated our principle and stance on the Taiwan issue , that is , upholding the one-China principle and the basic principles of " peaceful reunification and one China , two systems , " opposing any attempts of splitting China and permanently maintaining the current state of separation , and not allowing the Taiwan issue to drag on indefinitely .  
The ' repair company that has built up the business through thrift and hard work ' is an outstanding representative of this heroic unit , which has emerged during the period of peaceful construction ; it has an extraordinarily conspicuous record in building the business through thrift and hard work , for which it is famed throughout the army . "  
In the agreement reached on the summit meeting , both sides reaffirmed the three major principles of independence , peaceful reunification , and great national unity , which are not only conducive to both sides improving relations through dialogue , to realizing reconciliation , and to ultimately realizing peaceful reunification , but also in accord with the current requirements of the times for peace and development and are conducive to dispelling the cloud of a cold war over the peninsula and to maintaining peace in northeast Asia .  
With peaceful reunification , there will be reciprocal exchange , mutual cooperation , resources and market sharing , joint development and prosperity across the strait , but we do not want your money , nor collect taxes from you .  " Apart from letting you folks govern Taiwan , you can also take part in the management of China-wide affairs .  It is better than hiding in Taiwan with fear and trepidation , without any idea of the future , is it not ? "  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , persistence in settling international disputes through peaceful means , equality of sovereignty for all countries , respect for the national condition of every country , seeking harmony while reserving differences , and stepping up mutually beneficial cooperation for common development should be continually reiterated , efforts should be made to practice them , and they should be acted on by all countries .  
The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
He said : China is of the opinion that in order to resolve the issue of nonproliferation , first of all , it is necessary to establish a global security environment of stability , cooperation , and mutual trust .  Building a good international environment in which people adhere to peaceful means to resolve international disputes , and all members of the international community can enjoy universal safety will play a positive role in eliminating the motive of some countries to procure large-scale antipersonnel weapons .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational , and new international political and economic order .  
China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational and new international political and economic order .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
China has always devoted its efforts to international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy , advocating efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons .  But we should not ignore the legitimate right of all countries , particularly developing countries , to use nuclear energy peacefully , even less so applying a double standard , to exploit anti-proliferation as the means for restricting and obstructing cooperation by all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
In the great tide of world peace and development , the historical handshake of the Korean peninsula 's leaders from the north and south not only broke through the solid ice and opened the road for the Korean nation 's independent [ zizhu ] peaceful unification , it also created a beneficial environment and conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula , in the northeast Asian region , and the world .  
People generally believe that such a pragmatic approach and a win-win principle employed by both the North and the South will usher in a new dynamic period for exchanges as well as economic and trade cooperation , and lay a solid foundation for enhancing mutual understanding and trust , putting an end to confrontation , and seeking peaceful coexistence and prosperity between the two sides .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
These principles have now become universal standards for country-to-country relations , playing a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the friendship and cooperation among developing countries in general , and they are and will continue to have an important impact on the promotion of the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
As a friendly neighbor of ASEAN and a partner of mutual trust and cooperation , China has had a high regard all along for the positive role that ASEAN plays in regional affairs , respecting ASEAN 's efforts to establish a peaceful , free , and neutral region , supporting ASEAN 's economic integration , and hoping to consolidate and expand the multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in the areas of economics and trade , science and technology , and society , etc . "  
world peace is facing severe crisis .  We advocate that peace-loving people in the world should be enlightened by the fine traditions of Chinese Buddhism , truly work for the cause of world peace , eliminate the factors for war , and create a stable and peaceful international environment , so that sentient creatures can truly live and work in peace .  
To cope with the various challenges facing mankind 's survival and development , people strongly hope for the establishment of a new , fair and rational international political and economic order and the creation of an international peaceful environment that is safe and reliable and enjoys long-term stability and of an international harmonious situation in which countries make their own choices independently and seek common ground while reserving differences .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
The victory in the Qamdo Battle smashed the vain hopes of the imperialists and pro-imperialist forces in Tibet to split the motherland , smoothly opened the door of negotiations , promoted the process of peaceful liberation of Tibet , and laid a foundation for the Tibetan people to shake off the trammels of the feudal serf system and build a new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
China firmly adhered to its peaceful diplomacy of independence and self-determination , strongly advocated multipolarization in the world , and positively dealt with economic globalization .  It actively participated in regional cooperation and worked hard at creating a new international economic order that is fair and reasonable .  It devoted itself to just causes that promoted mankind 's peace and development .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
Fourth , the mutual visits and reunion of separated families of both sides and the fluttering of " flags of both sides on the Korean peninsula " during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games increased understanding between the north and the south , and expressed their wishes of realizing peaceful reunification through self-reliance .  
Both the north and the south have made firm steps toward the relaxation of tension and reconciliation on the peninsula .  Viewed from an historical angle , this is just the beginning of the long road toward peaceful reunification .  With the trend of easing tension and the acceleration in cooperation and exchange , the " agreement on truce " signed during the Cold War period can no longer meet the development and changes of the big trend in the international arena .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
Lin Chong-pin stated : Beijing 's Taiwan policy has been obviously integrated with its strategy , and the basic framework of this policy has not changed and remains to be the " one country , two systems " and " peaceful reunification . "  In the tactical aspect , however , Beijing has constantly readjusted the forms of this policy .  Since July 1999 , Beijing has applied four operational tactics toward Taiwan .  
Cai stated : The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , namely , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , have formed the core of the international law in modern times .  
Addressing the general debate at the 105th Conference of the Inter Parliamentarian Union on 4 April , Jiang Zhenghua , vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , called on the international community to promote the process of political multipolarity , capitalize on the opportunity of economic globalization to achieve common development and prosperity for all countries , and establish a new , peaceful , stable , fair , and rational political and economic world order in the new century .  
If the Japanese young people and children , beginning from thejunior high school textbooks , learn that " the aggression was reasonable , " " thewar was creditable , " and the aggression war was a " need " and was " aimed atterminating the colonial destiny of Asia " from the history " education , " then itis undoubtedly wishful thinking that can never be realized to hope that Chinaand Japan will keep a more peaceful and friendly relationship in futurecooperation and that Asia will enjoy a long-lasting stable environment for itsdevelopment .  
The frequent military reconnaissance activities that the United States have conducted in China 's coastal areas despite the repeated solemn representations from the Chinese Government are never out of a good peaceful purpose , but have an obvious nature of hostility and have posed a serious threat to China 's security and interest .  Meanwhile , these reconnaissance activities have obviously surpassed the scope of " overflight freedom " and violated the principle of " overflight freedom , " as stipulated in the " UN Convention of the Law of the Sea .  
Commenting on the issue of building a new international political and economic order , Jiang Zemin pointed out : The new international political and economic order should be built on the basis of the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence - - mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other internal affairs , equality and reciprocity , and peaceful coexistence - - and other universally acknowledged norms governing international relations .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Numerous facts have proven that US economic development is increasingly dependent on foreign countries and that the more peaceful and prosperous the world is and the more opened and developed the world is , the more it is beneficial to the United States . This all the more requires that the United States and various countries of the world improve their relations and support the peace and stability in the region .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
All sectors of the society , all cadres and the masses must adopt the perspective of the strategy of a strong nation , prosperous people , and peaceful world and fully recognize the extreme importance of protecting and reasonably utilizing natural resources .  Furthermore , protecting natural resources and optimizing the ecological environment must become conscious actions .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
They even slept near the door to fence off cold winds for their comrades .  In peaceful times , Party members took the lead in answering the call of the Party , executing Party lines and completing urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Having sufficient weapons and equipment is merely one of the conditions for ensuring national security , and other important conditions include peaceful and stable cross-strait relations , brisk and active economic development and competitiveness , and a sound and mature democratic political system .  
China wishes to work hard together with peoples from Africa and other countries in the world , and to make new contributions to the construction of a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order , and to world peace and development .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
Raidi pointed out : In Tibet , there is now smooth administration , all kinds of businesses are thriving , the society is stable , people of various nationalities are united , border defense has been consolidated , and people are living in peace and happiness .  Tibet is now in the best period of development since peaceful liberation in terms of social stability and economic development .  
When answering the question " what do you think deserves the most earnest congratulations in the 50 years since Tibet 's peaceful liberation , " 90 percent of the residents ' answer was : the shattering of the yoke of the feudal serfdom .  As a result , a-million serfs have stood up and have been masters of their fate .  They are now living an equal , harmonious , and independent new life .  
In the five decades of constant changes , China and Pakistan have strictly pursued the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , understood and trusted each other , stood and gone through thick and thin together , forged profound friendship , and thus became a model of peaceful coexistence between countries of different social systems .  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
Encouraged by the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and out of the worry about and righteous indignation at the " Taiwan independence " splittist forces ' attempt to split the country , Chinese nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have taken active actions and conscientiously plunged themselves into the powerful current of opposing " Taiwan independence " and division and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland , thus forming a grand-scale upsurge of patriotism .  
Liu Huadi : In the 50 years since its peaceful liberation , Tibet has witnessed a fast development in its education undertakings .  It now has a fairly complete modern educational system encompassing primary education , adult education , vocational and technical education and special education from primary school to university level .  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
On the afternoon of 22 May , patriotic personages of all ethnic groups from all social circles across the region held a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Looking back at the tremendous changes that had taken place in Tibet under the leadership of the CPC over the past half a century , they warmly lauded the glorious practice and the great victory of the party 's policies towards nationalities , religion , and the united front in Tibet .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
In order to bring about peaceful reunification , Mr . Deng Xiaoping on 26 June 1983 elaborated on a six-point proposal : Holding " talks on an equal footing to achieve a third round of cooperation , rather than talks between the central and local governments " , " after reunification , the Taiwan special administration region may practice a social system different from that of the mainland ;  
The social , economic , political , and military moves of any side will affect the reunification of China . The Democratic Progressive Party and Chen Shui-bian authorities are launching the " Taiwan independence " activities and are selling out Taiwan 's interest in collusion with the anti-China forces in the United States and Japan at the cost of making the people on both sides discouraged and disappointed at the peaceful reunification and afraid of the future . 
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
It stands for extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange to put peace and security on a more solid foundation .  " Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
Once one enters the re-education through labor facility , soft and relaxing music greets the ear , and it is suddenly bright before you .  It is exactly like one former " Falungong " member who has already been transformed said : A profusion of trees and grass grow in the yards , and spotted deer , peacocks , doves , and pheasants that are raised there also run all around - - when one casts their eyes around , one sees an auspicious and peaceful atmosphere .  
The two governments agreed to develop bilateral relations of friendly cooperation on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-intervention in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  They also agreed that while maintaining good political relations , efforts would be made to actively open up exchanges and cooperation in other fields , especially in economy and trade .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .  
Since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has made our strategy and countermeasures against this peaceful evolution clear , adhering to the Party 's basic line for the current stage of development , which is composed of " one center and two basic points , " adhering to the guiding strategy that " development is the absolute principle , " practicing a socialist market economy and striving to develop ourselves .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
All the people of China and the rest of the world long for a lasting world peace and for a stable and peaceful life .  They aspire for a fair and rational new international order and for democracy in international relations .  They yearn for common development and prosperity for all and are willing to work together for a better future .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that China and India are two biggest developing countries of the world .  Both of them face the tasks of developing the economy and improving the people 's living standard and need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment .  
and that it is different from the ambiguous and vacillating confederation concept , to be implemented by different stages , that the Chen Shui-bian Administration had proposed in its Mainland policy .  NPRF said that the KMT proposition would be conducive to the gradual creation of a mechanism governing the development of peaceful and stable cross-strait relations .  
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
PRC Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue has said that the OAU has completed its historic mission outstandingly well , and China sincerely wishes that the African Union will form a connecting link between past and future , carry forward the cause and forge ahead , and create still greater glory in building a peaceful and prosperous African continent .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
We have won the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games . This shows that the international community has acknowledged the fact that China is marked by social stability and progress , its economy is prospering , and its people are living a peaceful and comfortable life .  
After the Cold War , Chinese and Russian leaders decided to establish a new type of interstate relationship based on the five principles for peaceful coexistence out of their respective strategic needs for national construction and their common desire to work for world peace and development .  
Now we are happy that the treaty has been signed smoothly .  The peaceful thinking that China and Russia will remain " friends from generation to generation and never be enemy " to each other has been laid down in a legal form , becoming the program guiding the development of bilateral relations .  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
Today 's Tibet is a picture of vigor and prosperity as the economy is developing , society is making progress , the various ethnic groups are united , the situation is stable , the border defense is solid and the people are leading a peaceful and contented life .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
They also had an in-depth exchange of opinions on current major and urgent regional and international issues , thus reaching a broad consensus .  One of the most important results is that President Jiang and President Putin have signed the Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness , Friendship , and Cooperation . The treaty is permeated with peaceful thinking that the two countries will remain friends from generation to generation and never become enemies .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
The people of China and the people throughout the world all long for lasting world peace in the new century , a stable and peaceful life , the establishment of a new international order that is fair and rational , and the democratization of international relations , and they all long to promote common development and universal prosperity and together create a bright future for mankind .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
However , the world is still far from peaceful .  A multipolar world is evolving along a tortuous path , and so is economic globalization .

In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "

Dai Wenbin , a professor at China 's Taiwan Research Institute of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences , believes that the " inaugural speech " of the new leader of the Taiwan authorities was actually advocating " peaceful Taiwan independence " .  Judging by appearances , he used beautiful and pleasant sounding words when speaking , which made it appear that he wanted to express a meaning of detente .  
The side of the mainland motherland has also repeatedly expressed welcoming the visits of all the political parties , organizations , and personages from all circles in Taiwan , so as to exchange views and enhance common understanding on jointly opposing " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait relations , and pushing forward the progress of peaceful reunification .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although the international situation has seen profound changes , China will continue to unswervingly pursue the independent and peaceful foreign policy , develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and make joint efforts with other countries to build a just and rational new international political and economic order .  
She said : As a close neighbor of the Korean Peninsula , China has always supported the two sides of the north and the south of the Korean Peninsula to strive for the final realization of independent [ zi zhu ] and peaceful reunification of the peninsula through dialogue and consultations and without foreign interference .  
Over the past 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties , satisfactory headway has been made in the bilateral relations , and no issues pending an urgent solution exist between the two sides , as the five principles of peaceful coexistence has constituted the cornerstone of the kindred emotion between the two peoples .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to establish friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world , including Yugoslavia , on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and to make joint efforts for the establishment of a new , peaceful , stable , just , and rational political order so that mankind will have a better tomorrow .  
Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
The North-South Joint Declaration confirms the basic principles for pursuing independent and peaceful unification on the Korean Peninsula , as well as the direction for seeking unification .  It agrees to realize the exchange of visitor groups of separated families and relatives , and explicitly calls for seeking balanced national economic development through economic cooperation , increasing exchanges and cooperation in the social , cultural , sports , public health , and environmental spheres , and establishing a mechanism of dialogue between the two governments as soon as possible .  
It is the common hope of the international community that the North and South of the Korean Peninsula will show even greater courage and determination in implementing the agreements they have concluded and in eliminating estrangement and confrontation in an orderly and gradual manner through sustained and continuous dialogue and consultation , so as to create conditions favorable to the eventual realization of independent and peaceful unification on the Korean Peninsula .  
As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
In the letter Jiang Zemin reaffirmed that the north side and the south side are major parties concerned in the peninsula affairs , that China actively supports the consistent position of the northern side 's and southern side 's realizing independence and peaceful unification through dialogue and consultations , that China will , as always , continue to make positive efforts to help maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the two parties ' improving relations on the peninsula is in accord with both sides ' fundamental interests and with the common aspirations of the Korean nationality .  He expressed the belief that the meeting would enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides , promote both sides ' exchanges and cooperation in various fields , and ultimately create an excellent opening for realizing independence and peaceful unification on the peninsula .  
He said : The Chinese people cherish friendly feelings toward the Croatian people .  When your country declared independence in 1991 , China rapidly recognized it and established diplomatic relations with it in 1992 .  This was a decision made by the Chinese Government pursuant to its independent foreign policy of peace and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
A strong and stable China is the firm guarantee for a continued success of the principle of " one country , two systems , " whereas Hong Kong as a successful example will make increasing influence on the solution to the Taiwan issue according to the principle of " peaceful reunification based on the model of one country , two system . "  
During the meeting , the five countries ' heads of state exchanged extensive views on the regional situation and on international issues of common interest and reached a broad consensus on building a " big building " for good-neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation oriented toward the 21st century .  
At present , all the five countries are faced with the arduous tasks of invigorating the economy , of catching up with the tide of scientific and technological development , and of coping with the globalization challenges ; hence the earnest desire to have a long-term stable and peaceful environment for construction .  
These principles have been commonly accepted as the norms governing state-to-state relations , and they have played a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the promotion of friendship and cooperation among developing countries .  They have also already played and will continue to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
6 .  The two countries affirm their identical stands on major international issues .  They hold that international relations in the 21st century should be built on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the established norms of international law , and the dominant position on the United Nations in international affairs should be preserved and strengthened .  They advocate that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means , and that relations between states should be developed on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
2 .  On the other hand , an unprecedented great mass fervor in visiting the mainland and conducting cross-strait exchanges has arisen among Taiwan 's political parties , nongovernmental organizations , and representatives of popular will .  This is something really worth welcoming and really heartening because the people on both sides are the forces that will ultimately decide the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .  
In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
His views on winning a peaceful international environment for socialist construction , having diplomatic missions abroad consider foreign governments as their main object of work , doing what China is capable of in providing foreign aid and carrying out foreign affairs industriously and thriftily still have immediate significance until now .  
Their struggle would also bring endless disasters to humankind .  If , on the other hand , these two poles become true " constructive strategic partners " and join hands in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world with concerted efforts , the 21st century will have lasting peace and become the most peaceful century in modern history .  This will be the two countries ' greatest contributions to all humankind .  
It can be said that since the Sino-African relations of cooperation jointly forged and cultivated by the older generation of Chinese leaders and the pioneers of the African national liberation movements have been deeply rooted on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , they have undergone the tests of changes in the international situation and their own situation , and bilateral friendship and cooperation has been continually deepened and strengthened with time . 
There are three basic principles that must be emphasized in establishing a new peaceful , stable , fair and rational international political and economic order : First , all countries should be equal irrespective of their size .  Second , the right of the peoples of various countries in choosing the road of development according to respective national conditions should be respected .  Third , the sovereignty of all countries should not be violated and under no pretext should the internal affairs of other countries be interfered in .  
At the turn of the century , the international situation is going through profound changes .  The world is not peaceful , and various factors that threaten world peace and security have continued to exist .  Regional conflicts arising from racial , religious , and territorial disputes are on the rise , and there are complex conflicts and problems hampering the common development of countries .  
He said that the following three basic principles must be stressed in establishing a new international and economic order that is peaceful , stable , equitable and just : First , all countries , big or small , should be treated as equal .  
The 21st century is a century in which the cause of space will attain flourishing development .  Under the state 's overall planning and unified leadership , China will select limited objectives , effect breakthroughs at key points , actuate sustained development , and make still greater efforts to explore the peaceful uses of outer space for mankind .  
China respects Azerbaijan 's independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity , as well as the development path of the Azerbaijan people chosen in light of their national conditions .

During the meeting , Ye Xuanping gave a briefing on the achievements in reform and opening up of the motherland 's mainland as well as on the new social look of areas inhabited by the people of the Haka ethnic group .  He sincerely hoped compatriots on both sides of the strait will make great efforts to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese nation , take the culture of the Chinese nation as a link , promote consensus , communication and understanding , and make concerted efforts to promote the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
Supported by foreign anti-China forces , Taiwan separatist forces put up a desperate struggle , and Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] proposed the " two-state theory , " which wrecked the political basis for the steady development of cross-strait relations and seriously threatened the prospects for peaceful reunification .  
Both sides are ready to continue to develop their comprehensive friendly cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields pursuant to the aims and principles of the UN Charter as well as commonly acknowledged international laws and the norms of international relations , on the basis of respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference , equality , mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence .  
Leaders of the party and state have repeatedly reiterated sticking to the basic guideline of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and President Jiang 's eight proposals , continued to vigorously develop cross-strait economic cooperation , pushed for direct " three links " across the strait at an early date , and welcomed visits by Taiwan parties , bodies , and people of all circles to exchange views and promote consensus on opposing together " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait ties , and promoting the process of peaceful reunification .  
Hu Yuanshao , the eighth chairman of the European Federation of Overseas Chinese and Ethnic Chinese Mass Organizations and president of the Austrian General Association of Ethnic Chinese , said : An early accomplishment of peaceful reunification by China is the common wish of overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese .

Practically all the overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese mass organizations in France participated in activities for exchanges and communication with them , giving advice and suggestions for accomplishing China 's great cause of peaceful reunification .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said when interviewed by Xinhua reporters today that in the past year China has achieved gratifying success in actively and steadily promoting relations with the major powers , making every effort to create a stable and peaceful peripheral environment , consolidating and developing relations with the developing countries , and vigorously promoting multilateral diplomacy and regional cooperation .  This has laid a good foundation for China to actively pursue all-round diplomacy in the new century .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .

Both China and Iran face the task of developing their respective economies and need a peaceful and stable international and surrounding environment .  The two countries share many common interests and hold many common viewpoints in terms of international and regional affairs .

When interviewed by the reporter of Hong Kong 's " WEN WEI PO , " an official from a pertinent central department pointed out that six years ago President Jiang made the eight-point proposal for accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland , objectively analyzed the situation with which we were confronted for the solution of the Taiwan issue , and proposed the measures to further develop the cross-strait relations and advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland , which are reasonable , practical , and feasible .  
Cohen , a political figure who has published many poetry books , mentioned that he said on the Shanghai Stock Exchange that as the middle class on the Chinese mainland grows , their middle class will do " what every middle class has done throughout history " : it will seek a greater voice in governing , it will suggest new and creative approaches to national challenges , and it will push for peaceful solutions to international disputes and stable commerce with its neighbors .  
We , Chinese journalists , will , as usual , work together with our counterparts in all countries of the world to make unswerving efforts for establishing a new international political and economic order of being peaceful , stable , fair , and reasonable and for promoting world peace and development .  
By doing so , they disturbed the normal social order , bringing a sharp contrast to the auspicious and peaceful atmosphere of festivity and the happy mood of the tourists on the square .  This touched off intense anger among the masses .  
On the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , we will further develop ties of friendship and cooperation with countries around the world , actively push forward the process of world multipolarization , make efforts to play our proper role in international affairs , and make new contributions to establishing a fair and rational new international political and economic order , preserving world peace , and promoting common development .

The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "

He described this as " a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole . "  He also recognized the popular wish for a " stable and peaceful situation in the Taiwan Strait . "  
If we have steady agricultural development , peasants will live in happiness and rural areas will be prosperous .  If such being the case , the state will enjoy a stable situation and the world will be peaceful .  China 's history has proven this over the past several thousand years .  
Deputy Ping Ziliang , who is a professor of Inner Mongolia Teachers ' University , said : Last year , through dealing harsh blows at various types of serious criminal offenders , the judicial and procuratorial organs played a great role in guaranteeing that the people could live and work in a peaceful and safe environment , and at the same time , they also provided a good preconditions and guarantee for economic development .

But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .

- The Bar Association has accepted the need for a legal regime to regulate the orderly exercise of a citizen 's right to take part in peaceful assemblies and processions .  At the same time , it states that it is a matter of fundamental importance that such legal regime should not be so overbearing as to have the effect of stifling or threatening any exercise of such a right .  
The motion , to be moved by the Secretary for Security , says : " That this Council considers that the Public Order Ordinance 's existing provisions relating to the regulation of public meetings and public processions reflect a proper balance between protecting the individual 's right to freedom of expression and right of peaceful assembly , and the broader interests of the community at large , and that there is a need to preserve these provisions . "  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .  
" One Country , Two Systems " is an innovative concept , originated in China , designed by men of vision , courage and consummate wisdom .  It has made possible the peaceful resolution of problem left over from history concerning sovereignty , life style and constitutional institutions .  It has enabled two different systems , one capitalist and the other socialist , to co-exist within one country .  
These boys and girls are fortunate to have lived in peaceful times , never really lacking , never suffering .

In another picture , History 's Traces , a peaceful river scene is disrupted by large , fragmented , white pieces of space at the bottom and center . Despite his boldness and originality of spirit , though , Chen still had difficulty in getting himself accepted as more than a cartoonist .  
Today there is yet another " transitional period , " which calls for yet again undertaking deep examination - - only by balancing the wisdom accumulated over time with the flourishing development of material culture from the West can we assure a peaceful and prosperous future for mankind .  
It does the last because it allows ROC citizens to practically comprehend the mainland , and allows the country 's future to be decided by open discussion ; in this way there slowly takes shape a consensus . Given Taiwan 's objective and subjective conditions , there is no way to accept either reunification under Chinese communist rule or absolute independence . It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .

Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
We even proposed that during that week , gays and supporters of gay rights in Taiwan wear a different color each day-red , orange , yellow , green , blue and purple-over six days , to express the expectations represented in the gay rainbow banner for peaceful dignity and equal respect . "

It was such a contrast from her usual calm and peaceful visage , and made her look both scared and in pain .  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
Leaving behind peaceful , picturesque Tsaotun , we come to Puli Township , which is a center of art , culture and scenic beauty . Downtown Puli is bustling and appears completely restored , but in the surrounding boroughs and villages many problems still hamper both physical reconstruction and economic recovery .  
In May 2000 a peaceful transfer of power was accomplished for the first time in Chinese history when the Democratic Progressive Party 's Chen Shui-bian took over as president of the Republic of China . In his inaugural address , he stressed that the country was founded based on respect for human rights . Then in October of that year he formally established an advisory committee on human rights chaired by Vice President Annette Lu .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
Chiu held onto a spirit of " releasing the spirit tied up by the cities and returning to the peaceful , simple life of the country . " Putting features of Taiwanese scenery-whether from Lanyu , Penghu , or Chiufen-into his paintings , he came at his topics from a critical angle . Rather than making comparisons about beauty or ugliness , he relied on inner feeling-taking his melancholy and concerns about the transformation of the local landscape and revealing them for everyone to see on his canvases .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .  
The Sudan has very favourable natural conditions for its economic development , Qian said adding that in developing economy , a peaceful international environment and a stable domestic political order are very important  
Shen Guofang said , international peace and security stand as a precondition for the promotion and protection of human rights , adding that without a peaceful and secure environment , no protection can be possibly guaranteed for either civil and political rights or economic , social and cultural rights  
" The Chinese government and people are ready to work with all other governments and peoples of the world to make their due contribution to establishing a peaceful , stable , just and equitable new international political and economic order and to promoting the lofty cause of world peace and development , " he concluded  
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) on nuclear weapons , and all its atomic programs are based on " peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical , agricultural and energy generation purposes " and " within the framework of the internationally recognized absolute rights of any country "  
beijing , june 27 ( xinhua ) chinese premier li peng said here today that the five principles of peaceful co existence , which have shown strong vitality in the past 40 years , have become an important part of the norms of international relations and played a tremendous role in promoting world peace and international friendly cooperation  
li also briefed the russian guests on china 's foreign policies he said that after the cold war , the world is facing a multi polarization trend yet the world is not peaceful new conflicts and contradictions keep occurring the gap between the north and the south is further enlarged , li said  
Ensuring a modicum of the sense of individual , local and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions .  
Our Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , also deserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and just and sustained by an equitable economic order .  
We trust that , with his vision , wisdom and unique statesmanship , he will ably guide South Africa into a peaceful , stable and prosperous future .  We are confident that South Africa has a dynamic role to play in the community of free States .  
The areas of concern included efforts to bring an effective end to public violence and intimidation and to help to create a climate conducive to negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic nonracial and united South Africa .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
It was also stressed that the planned withdrawal of ONUMOZ was contingent on the holding of peaceful , free and fair elections , the timely announcement of the results of the elections and the subsequent establishment of the new Government .  
New democracies virtually everywhere are confronting the common challenge of ensuring the peaceful processes of political transformation , the establishment and consolidation of internal democratic institutions and norms , and structural readjustment accompanied by socially oriented economic transformations backed up by a system of measures and guarantees for social justice in society .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The view was expressed that an international legal regime dealing with issues related to the dual use of military satellites and non-discriminatory access to the information obtained from such satellites should be elaborated and that such an instrument would promote the peaceful uses of outer space and the maintenance of outer space for peaceful purposes .  
Keep peacemaking as proposed clearly in its basic tradition , the peaceful settlement of disputes , as foreseen in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations , in contrast to peace enforcement , which is perceived as a projection of provisional measures as defined in Chapter VII , Article 40 , of the Charter in respect to breaches of the peace and acts of aggression , but where both proposals are distinct permanent mechanisms to meet new challenges of the times .  
During the past half century the United Nations , as no other international organization , has acquired credibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace , as a mediator and active participant in the peaceful settlement of conflicts , and as a champion of human rights .  
Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
Morocco , which opted for dialogue as a fundamental principle in its policy vis - - vis its neighbours , propounded that principle in international forums as the best means of avoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by peaceful means , remains convinced that its historical ties with Spain , coupled with the two countries ' common economic interests , will help overcome the difficulties that stand in the way of a solution to this dispute . 
To this end Croatia has already proposed to the local Serbs and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , through the good offices of the international mediators , a comprehensive , elaborate and concrete peace plan in the form of a draft agreement on the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Srijem into the constitutional and economic system of the Republic of Croatia .  
Upon signing the agreement on the peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would recognize each other within their internationally recognized borders and diplomatic relations between these two States would be established at the ambassadorial level .  
Moreover , with a view to building a peaceful , prosperous and modern nation , my Government has formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in the political , economic and social spheres .  
This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
It is an encouraging sign that the international community , through the United Nations , the OAU and the Commonwealth , is just as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling Council Government to see an early end to our destructive war so that our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live in an environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage in their ordinary daily pursuits .  
Thus , for those who believe that the African is less than human or is incapable of governing himself , the existence for almost a century and a half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with strong economic potential is undesirable .  
When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
Under such circumstances , the Court , fully aware of its responsibilities as an integral part of the system of peaceful settlement of international disputes established under the Charter , has displayed judicial realism and has considered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties closer together , while not at any time departing from its primary task of applying the law .  
Peace can only be maintained by observing such norms governing international relations as respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , and by establishing , in accordance with the United Nations Charter , a new international political and economic order that is just and fair .  
Nevertheless , these operations can not be transformed into the Organization 's priority objective ; rather , the essential part of the activities of the United Nations must focus on preventing conflicts that affect international peace and security , and to this end its role as a forum for ongoing dialogue where disputes are discussed and resolved by peaceful means needs to be strengthened .  
If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
The Agency 's role as a centre for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was confirmed , and the IAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority responsible for verifying compliance with safeguards agreements .  
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
The challenge for the Agency in this connection is to keep providing credible assurances on States Parties ' compliance with their non-proliferation commitments in an increasingly volatile international security environment and amidst a rapid quantitative increase in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and constant advances in nuclear technology .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
These obligations include achieving complete nuclear disarmament , expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , strengthening the role and enhancing the authority of the IAEA as the only international body competent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member States ' responsibilities under the Treaty , ensuring the universality of the NPT as an urgent priority , and establishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us , from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya , with the assistance of United States authorities . 
Today we can say that in the 1990s , with the end of the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism , an unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the course of history and , for the first time , to secure the values of a democratic , just , peaceful , civil and reconciled society , with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed will of the people .  
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
Understood as a value which encompasses universal pluralism and a genuine acceptance of cultural diversity , the idea of tolerance represents , first of all , a valuable intellectual and practical framework within which the vitally important norms of a good society and a peaceful world can be developed .  
Moreover , the shared approaches that have characterized these last few years do not in themselves resolve many of the substantive problems of the international system , such as those pertaining to collective security , economic and social development and the defence of the perennial values that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life for peoples and individuals .  
We need to eradicate social and economic inequalities , both nationally and internationally , to create a stable , peaceful and healthy environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
Zainuddin ( Malaysia ) : My delegation echoes previous speakers in welcoming the desire and commitment of Turkmenistan to play a constructive role in the development of peaceful , friendly and mutually beneficial relations with other members of the international community on the basis of the principles of positive neutrality .  
Surely it is more than mere symbolism that the very first resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its first session , on 24 January 1946 , was devoted to limiting the use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes , and to eliminating from national arsenals atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
From the early days of the national division , the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il Sung put forward a number of reasonable proposals for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and devoted all his efforts to their realization up to the last moment of his life .  
The pan-national unified State to be established in accordance with the proposal for reunification through confederation will form a confederated government in which the two regional autonomous governments of the north and south of Korea participate on an equal footing , and will be an independent , peaceful , non-aligned and neutral State that does not depend on any other big Power .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Stressing the growing importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development in current international relations , and recognizing the importance of promoting social and economic development and international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ,  
By helping to sustain a secure and stable environment , UNMIH will facilitate the Government 's conduct of free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections , culminating in the peaceful transition to a newly elected Government in February 1996 .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
We should therefore like to stress the importance of advancing in the creation of a true partnership between the less developed and the more developed , at an appropriate pace , as a crucial step in fostering an equitable and peaceful international system at the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
Many crucial steps remain to be taken to achieve the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of Haiti and to provide for the Haitian people a peaceful and stable future based on democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law and on economic and social justice .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
It needs to be emphasized that a peaceful settlement of the Angolan civil conflict is not only essential for the people of Angola themselves , but also of major importance to political stability and economic development in southern Africa as a whole .  
The brother African country of Angola , long the victim of an unrelenting civil war and of enormously lethal events , has just provided eloquent proof that it is always possible to reconcile warring brothers who want to bury the hatchet the better to work together to build a peaceful , democratic and prosperous nation .  
Calls on all parties concerned to respond positively to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter , which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiation , mediation and judicial procedures , and calls for a fair and impartial trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
States participating in regional arrangements or agencies are encouraged to consider the possibility of using or , where appropriate , establishing or improving at the regional level procedures and mechanisms for the early detection , the prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes , in close coordination with the preventive efforts of the United Nations ;  
Russia was prepared to seek mutually acceptable decisions with regard to security guarantees for the non-nuclear States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , which would create favourable conditions for the development of broad international cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes , taking duly into account the needs of the developing countries .  
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
Azerbaijan has repeatedly given tangible proof of its commitment to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and has based its approach to the solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the generally accepted international norms of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and respect for human rights .  
In the letter of 10 February from its President addressed to the Secretary-General ( S / 1995 / 130 ) and its presidential statement of 10 February ( S / PRST / 1995 / 7 ) , the Security Council demonstrated its continued concern and , above all , its readiness to support additional practical measures and efforts that would lead to a more peaceful and stable Rwanda .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
While there are many factors that have precipitated the present crisis , the principal underlying cause has been the lingering lack of trust and confidence between the parties and the resultant political stalemate for the past three years , leading to fears on the Croatian side that a peaceful political settlement is unattainable and providing encouragement to hardliners on the Krajina Serb side to think that independence or union in a " Greater Serbia " are realistic options .  
On the other hand , it is ironic that a mentality which has attempted to annex the whole island and continues to entertain irredentist designs on Cyprus , in flagrant violation of international law and all norms governing peaceful relations among nations , can feel eligible to interfere with and complain about proposed amendments to existing legislation in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus regarding utilization and ownership of property in the North .  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
We hope that Iraq will soon be in a position to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , so that there will be no need for this mechanism and so that Iraq may resume its regional and international role in the peaceful and positive manner that would enable the brotherly people of Iraq to overcome the years of hardship and to make up for their losses in the domain of economic and social development .  
Efforts should be made to remove those unreasonable restrictions on transfer of nuclear energy technology so as to help the developing countries master the technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a new international cooperative relationship in the field of nuclear energy .  
Continued engagement and commitment by all Haitian parties to the successful organization of free , fair and peaceful legislative and local elections in June , a crucial step in consolidating democracy , is another key priority .  
" Each State party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide : ( a ) source or special fissionable material , or ( b ) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use , or production of special fissionable material , to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes , unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this article ( IAEA safeguards ) . "  
I have the honour to forward to you the text of a paper providing information on the activities and views of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the three underlying objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons : to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons ; to provide a sound basis for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ; and to encourage negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to disarmament .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Russian Federation remains faithful to the principles of equitable international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and providing assistance to developing countries and regions of the world in satisfying their wishes on the basis of non-discrimination , if they are legitimate and do not run counter to the Treaty .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
Today is the ninth anniversary of the barbaric slaughter perpetrated by the treacherous and aggressive forces of the United States of America and NATO , the anniversary of the loathsome crime committed by the enemies of humanity , who ruthlessly deprived many of life , making women widows , children orphans , and terrorizing peaceful citizens .  
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
Ensuring a modicum of the sense of the individual , local , and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions . "  
Obviously , we all prefer peaceful means , but when brutal force is used the Secretary-General must have the right to use the resources available to him , in consultation with the relevant troop contributors , as stated in this resolution , to employ our resources in the most effective manner possible to meet the humanitarian needs of so many desperate Bosnian citizens and to achieve a lasting peace .  
Calls on all parties concerned to positively respond to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiations , mediation and legal procedures in conformity with international law and calls for a fair trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
Commends the people of Haiti for their peaceful participation in the first round of municipal and legislative elections and calls upon the Government and political parties in Haiti to work together to ensure that the remaining municipal and legislative elections and the presidential elections to be held at the end of this year are conducted in an orderly , peaceful , free and fair manner , in accordance with the Haitian Constitution ;  
Commends the people of Haiti for their peaceful participation in the first round of municipal and legislative elections and calls upon the Government and political parties in Haiti to work together to ensure that the remaining municipal and legislative elections and the presidential elections to be held at the end of this year are conducted in an orderly , peaceful , free and fair manner , in accordance with the Haitian Constitution ;  
Ensuring the backstopping of essential human freedoms such as acceptably peaceful and equitable political , economic and social environments that promote individual , local and national security .  
Faced with the joint and highly coordinated offensive military activities of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs , and the growing interference of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , the Republic of Croatia presented the Croatian Serb leaders with a clear choice : to accept immediately the principles of peaceful reintegration or face police and military action aimed at restoring Croatian sovereignty over its occupied territories .  
Let us hope that this is the last time never again the world will watch these sad pictures , directed for us by those who for more than three years pulled the leg of very cooperative and acquiescent representatives of the international community by rejecting all initiatives for solving the crisis in Croatia and for the peaceful reintegration of Krajina into the sovereign and independent State of Croatia .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
As far as Croatia is concerned such peaceful settlements imply complete restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders , with full guarantees of minority rights given to the Serbian ethnic community in Croatia accompanied , should there be a need , by international monitoring .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice .  
It is inexplicable and hypocritical that the NATO aggression should come at a time when negotiations are in progress and when major steps are made along the road to the ultimate peaceful resolution , in the name of peace and the United Nations , which have been created with a goal of assisting and protecting the peoples who are endangered and not to give in to the militants implicated even in the war crimes .  
The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
However , the coexistence of different groups is not always peaceful , and problems relating to minorities are today one of the major sources of international and internal conflicts involving widespread and at times massive human rights violations with severe repercussions for the peace and stability of the community of nations .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .

Ukraine takes the view that the balanced and constructive position of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , backed by specific practical measures , raises the urgent question of the essential need to lift the Security Council sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , since that is an integral part of the process of a comprehensive peaceful settlement in the Balkans .  
Some leading representatives of the international community pointed out on more than one occasion that it was operation " Storm " that changed the strategic balance in the former Yugoslavia and paved the way for the negotiated peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas of Croatia and a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

has been emphasized in Security Council resolution 1023 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the transitional administration is to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the region into the Croatian legal and constitutional system following four years of war and hostility , which have created deep apprehension , fear and distrust between the Croatian Government and the local Serbs .  
In view of the obvious link between human rights violations , the mass displacement of persons and the emergence of threats to international peace and security , Russia agreed with UNHCR that human rights monitoring must be one of the preventive measures included in plans for United Nations peace-keeping activities and in negotiations on peaceful settlement of disputes , and that safeguarding human rights was closely linked to the protection of refugees .  
the meeting of heads of State of the subregion held in Addis Ababa in 1992 with a view to seeking a lasting solution to that human tragedy , it had been recognized that the only way of finally resolving the problem was not simply through achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts but also , and above all , through improving the economic situation of the countries concerned . 
The standards on indigenous rights to be elaborated by the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights should promote peaceful and constructive solutions based on the principles of multicultural societies , inter-ethnic understanding and harmony and tolerance .  Respect for the rights of indigenous people did not prejudice the territorial integrity of States , but strengthened it and prevented violent conflicts .

Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .

She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
that end , the Supreme Council called on the international community to maintain the pressures on the Iraqi Government until Iraq gave proof of its peaceful intentions and completed implementation of the provisions of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other pertinent United Nations resolutions , in particular those relating to the release of prisoners and detainees , both Kuwaitis and nationals of other States , whose extended suffering was in blatant violation of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and the third and fourth Geneva Conventions .  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .  
As I stated on a previous occasion , Bolivia is of the view that many conflict situations can be explained by the persistence of unresolved social and national problems , as well as by the accumulation of age-old injustices and resentments ; by geopolitical and economic interests that for decades have been fuelling confrontation from without and from within ; and , above all , by Governments ' inability to cooperate effectively so as to provide timely and peaceful solutions to the problems of greatest national concern . 
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
We also call upon Iran to respond to the peace initiatives we have advanced and which are supported by sisterly and friendly peace-loving countries ; to enter into unconditional bilateral negotiations conducive to a peaceful settlement of the dispute ; or to refer the case to the International Court of Justice .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
The qualitative developments that have taken place in Mali 's northern regions show clearly the determination of Mali 's young democracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a concerted and peaceful way , with the active participation of all players and with scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .

It has played a significant , discernible and indispensable role in human affairs , from the peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to economic development and social progress , from food and agriculture to employment and labour standards , from helping the children of our world to fostering human rights and justice .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
The presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable opportunity to review the work which the Agency has carried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of its activities in the various fields in which it operates in accordance with its statutory functions , both in respect of its work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , as well as in the strengthening of international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiological protection and waste management .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
Fourthly , bearing in mind the major aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our country 's economic and social development , we would once more like to stress that our country is supporting the Agency 's measures for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime , within the context of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
We are grateful to all Member States that supported our appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal respect of international law as reflected , for instance , in General Assembly resolution 49 / 43 , which created the political conditions and legal framework for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia .  
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
Although 1996 began on a promising note with the peaceful and democratic general elections held in Palestine on 20 January , a series of devastating terrorist attacks against Israel in late February and early March quickly enveloped the spirit of optimism surrounding the peace process in a sombre and cynical cloud .  
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .

Such problems include breaches of basic discipline such as the non-wearing of uniforms and lack of proper identification on vehicles ; the bearing of arms while off duty ; the disproportionate use of force in carrying out police duties ; lack of experience in the legitimate use of firearms ; inappropriate methods of crowd control ; and insufficient use of techniques for the peaceful settlement of disputes .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,

It stands against the letter and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement , recognized by the international community as the legal binding instrument to preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula until it will be replaced - hopefully in the near future - by a peaceful settlement agreed upon by all sides involved .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
The Ministers reiterated their call to the Iranian Government to end its occupation of the islands , to desist from pursuing a policy of imposing faits accomplis by force , to halt the adoption of unilateral measures , to remove the effects of any unilateral measures taken or any installations built , to adopt peaceful means of resolving the ongoing dispute in accordance with the principles and norms of international law , and to agree to the referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice .  
Indeed , the English occupation in 1765 had been partial and precarious ; the fact that they had left tangible signs of possession to indicate their intention of returning could not constitute a legal claim that was more compelling than the continuous , effective and peaceful exercise of State sovereignty over the entire archipelago for many years .  
Considering the Security Council sanctions an inalienable and integral part of the international efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia , Ukraine has complied with all United Nations resolutions concerning the obligatory trade and economic embargo against the FRY and has taken appropriate measures on a national level to ensure their observance .  
The major changes in the world , which have eliminated confrontation between blocs , have already had an impact on the situation in the Mediterranean region , where the outlines of a peaceful future are beginning to take shape : the Middle East peace process is proceeding , although with considerable difficulty ; the move towards peace in the Balkans is continuing ; and there is a growing understanding of the importance of establishing regional cooperation for economic growth and rescuing the environment of the Mediterranean basin . 
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
While urging the United Nations to take the necessary steps to halt the irresponsible actions of the United States Administration , which can only reduce the Organization 's role to insignificance and destroy the peaceful basis on which international relations are built , the Government of the Republic of Iraq holds the United States Government fully accountable before international law for any consequences its aggressive and unlawful positions vis - - vis Iraq may have . 
The emergency joint meeting adopted a decision on taking strong countermeasures in response to the dangerous manoeuvre of the Kim Yong Sam cliques who are misusing the recently occurred accident during a training mission , aggravating the north-south confrontation and driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in succession to the brutal crackdown on the peaceful unification events organized by the students of " Han Chong Ryon " of south Korea on 15 August 1996 by unreasonably relating those to us . 
Because of the obstacles experienced and the serious hindrances caused by the Israeli leadership 's failure to respect its commitments , our Council must today face the logical results of such a situation and of the Israeli attitude , which differs greatly from what the international community has set down as the fundamental principles for a peaceful , comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict .

In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .

With that perception , we believe that it is high time to completely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past , namely , the imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations , sanctions and embargoes , and so forth , which distort international relations , cause suffering to the people and seriously violate the minimum right of human beings the right to a peaceful life .

Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .

Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .

For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .

Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .

It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .

International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The Secretary-General added , however , that while the warring parties had shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it was noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans had taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who were not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Bosnia and Herzegovina has the sad distinction of having numerous conferences and debates focused on its tragic destiny among them those of the Security Council aimed at finding a fair and peaceful settlement of the conflict tearing it asunder .  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
While speaking in favour of a peaceful settlement of the conflict at the earliest possible date , the Republic of Armenia received , during the period 1993 to 1996 , a vast amount of Russian weaponry , far exceeding its requirements , including tanks , armoured vehicles and SCUD missiles , worth $ 1-billion .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
We are witnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance , violence and non-respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; incitements to hatred are spreading to many corners of the planet ; many peoples are still oppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of freedom ; and international disputes which must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means , in accordance with the San Francisco Charter are continuing , imperilling peace and security .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
With regard to the overlapping claims by neighbouring States with adjacent or opposite coasts over exclusive economic zones or continental shelves , the Chinese Government is in favour of seeking proper solutions through peaceful negotiations in accordance with well - established international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
Regarding existing disputes , it is our view that they should be settled through peaceful negotiations in a spirit of equality , mutual understanding and respect for each other 's sovereignty and jurisdiction over respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones , in accordance with international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
The intimate relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation commitments , on the one hand , and free trade and cooperation for peaceful purposes , on the other , is reflected in this article , and it is thus essential that the careful balance be preserved as the Convention is implemented .  
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Having had the privilege of meeting with a wide variety of brilliant people in Turkey and having seen the horrendous pain and needless suffering stemming from the tragedy that terrorism today imposes on this country of limitless potential , the Special Rapporteur is convinced that the safeguarding of the right to freedom of opinion and expression by the Government and the support for such a policy by society as a whole have the potential to become the foundation for the building of a peaceful , prosperous and just future for Turkey . 
In order for the UNISPACE III Conference to yield concrete results in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , sufficient consideration should be given to the planning of realistic and feasible follow-up activities that could be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the UNISPACE III Conference .  
In this connection , everyone is entitled , individually and in association with others , to be effectively protected under national law in reacting against or opposing , through peaceful means , activities and acts attributable to States which result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .

The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
UNISPACE III , which had taken place in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and the exhibition of space science and technology organized in parallel with that event , had given the participants an opportunity to evaluate the current state of international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space and to consider ways and means of further developing the respective programmes and strategies with which humankind would enter the twenty-first century .

The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .

Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter .

On the question of the formulation of the provision , the view was expressed that , while the spirit of the proposal could be supported , an absolute formulation making the prior resort to peaceful settlement of disputes a sine qua non for the imposition of sanctions would be too inflexible in practice , as there may be occasions when sanctions would have to be resorted to immediately , and that it would go further than Article 40 of the Charter , which is formulated in permissive terms .

One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
This , however , has not prevented us from taking concrete steps that demonstrate our clear desire for peace and general and complete disarmament , as well as demonstrating the transparency and peaceful nature of the nuclear programme we are developing.I have the honour to report to the plenary Assembly that last month Cuba signed a protocol additional to the safeguards agreements that it entered into on a voluntary basis with the IAEA .

In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .

By the same token , my delegation abstained in the separate vote on the third preambular paragraph , as we have done in corresponding cases in previous years , because it is our view that the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an inalienable right of all States and therefore can not be made conditional on whether or not one is a party to certain international treaties .  
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .

The five principles of peaceful coexistence make up the political foundation underpinning world peace ; mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity constitute the economic guarantee for world peace ; dialogue , consultations and negotiations between the parties concerned on an equal footing represent the correct approach to resolving disputes and safeguarding peace.In this context , we call on the international community to take this new security concept as a guideline .  
In order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , States Parties to the Treaty conducting activities in outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , agree to inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as the public and the international scientific community , to the greatest extent feasible and practicable , of the nature , conduct , locations and results of such activities .

Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures .

This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .

It is fitting that Ireland , as a strong and consistent supporter of East Timors peaceful transition to a stable , democratic and effective and independent State , is presiding over the Council at this important point in East Timors transition process .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .
