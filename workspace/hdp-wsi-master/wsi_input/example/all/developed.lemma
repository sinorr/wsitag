Xinhua News Agency , Geneva , May 27 ( Reporter Cai Shihao ) - The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) published a report in Geneva on the 27th , stating that the economic situations of the 50 least developed nations in the world have significantly improved .  However , various unfavorable factors are still restricting a continuous and steady economic growth of these countries .  
The most recent annual report of UNCTAD stated that the average annual increase rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the least developed nations from 2000 to 2002 was 4.9 percent ; the average annual increase in the per capita GDP was 2.6 percent , exceeding the 1.8 percent level of average annual increase in the per capita GDP of other developing countries .  
In 2002 , the total foreign direct investments absorbed by the 50 least developed nations were US $ 5.2-billion .  However , 83 percent of these were concentrated on 10 main beneficiary nations .  
UNCTAD indicated that the excessive dependence on foreign capital , rapidly rising foreign debts , the low and unstable prices of primary products , the continuous spread of HIV / AIDS , and unceasing civil wars are all important factors that hinder the continuous economic improvements of the least developed nations .  
Speaking by regions , the economically more developed northern regions including Lombardy accounted for 45.1 percent of the national population , middle regions including the Lazio region , where the capital Rome is located , took up 19.2 percent , and southern regions including Sicily , where the economy is relatively underdeveloped , accounted for 35.7 percent .  
Experts believed that the situation was associated with the broad move of Italian domestic residents within the country in recent years , especially given that residents in southern regions , out of economic hardship , were increasingly moving to the economically more developed northern and middle regions to find jobs .  
Mount Wutai is renowned worldwide for its Buddhist culture of a long tradition , unsurpassable exquisite ancient architectural art , as well as the magical and beautiful natural scenery .  It has been nearly 2,000 years since temple construction started in the 11th year of Yongping , Donghan Dynasty ( AD 68 ) .  It has developed into the world 's only Buddhist center where the blue Buddhism ( Chinese Buddhism ) and yellow Buddhism ( Lamaism ) coexist on one mountain and deliver sermons together .  
Currently , foreign funded enterprises in Gansu Province no longer worry about investment risk .  To ensure that the opening up to the outside world can be implemented smoothly , during the " eighth five-year plan " period ( 1991 to 1995 ) , Gansu Province 's foreign affairs insurance industry developed rapidly , and it has already provided an accumulated sum of 61.1-billion yuan in terms of risk safeguard .  Insurance coverages include the four large categories of property , liability , credit and life , with more than sixty primary and secondary risk types .  
The Shantou Ultrasonic Instrument Institute , by adhering to the road of mutually combining imported and in-house research development , has successively researched and developed more than forty new high level technology products , with an annual output value surpassing 100-million yuan .  The ultrasonic visualization diagnostic apparatus , known as " China 's B ultrasound " , is sold far away to countries in Europe and America and other regions .  
It was learned that , the national project of new medicines and industrialized development , jointly promoted by departments of the State Science Commission , the Ministry of Public Health , the State Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau , etc . , is now being implemented .  By the end of this century , ten new patent protected medicines are planned to be developed and five new medicine selecting centers , five medication safety assessing centers and five medication clinic experimentation centers will be built .  
This information website that was organized and developed by the China Economic and Trade Co-operation Information Network Center , organized and collected economic and trade information and foreign co-operation projects sanctioned from various Chinese provinces and cities , currently has stored nearly 10,000 items of foreign co-operation projects from domestic and foreign regions .  Domestic and foreign merchants can query via the internet , search for project co-operation intention , and accept commissions from domestic and foreign merchants to provide investment consulting services , mutual transmission of project information , and promote co-operation project implementation .  
We should select in a planned way a number of outstanding young cadres for tempering themselves at central state organs or in economically developed areas with their original positions retained for them , in order to help them widen their field of vision , adopt new ideas , and increase their abilities .  
Now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and utilize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them creatively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attract a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .  
The complete success of the maiden flight of Shenzhou [ Magic Vessel ] , a manned experimental spacecraft developed by China itself , evoked strong response inside China and overseas .  The flight is of great significance to increasing our country 's international prestige , strengthening national defense and upholding the motherland 's security and unity , and increasing the centripetal force and rallying power of Chinese nationality inside China and overseas .  It has also provided new opportunities and useful resources for the development of China 's national industry .  
Relying on scientific innovation and technological innovation , we have developed China 's first transistor line-relay protective device , the first digital tele-control equipment , and first digital line protective device for 32-bit computers over the past few decades .  So far we have won 198 scientific and technological achievement awards at the national , provincial , or ministry levels .  Our dominant products are among the best in the country and are up to international advanced standards .  
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .  
As S &amp; T have developed briskly throughout the world and economic structural adjustment has accelerated , and impacted by the Asian financial crisis , a certain international deflationary state has appeared .  This has also had a definite impact on China 's overall prices .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
Drawing a lesson from the bitter experience , Hainan has since then set sights on its good ecological environment and its unique resources and re-established the industrial strategy of building itself as a base of tropical and high-efficiency agriculture and as an island tourist resort .  At the same time , it has developed high-technology , high-value-added , and high-efficiency industry which does not cause pollution , does not require redundant construction , and does not destroy resources .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
He said : During the past 20 years , the economic exchange and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan have steadily developed and continuously grown in quality and quantity , and the contacts of people and activities of social and cultural intercourse have been increasingly frequent , thus initially forming a pattern of mutual complementarity , mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development of the economies of the two localities .  
In the automobile industry , a fairly solid foundation and strength have been built up for the production of motor cycles and medium-sized and light buses .  For sedan cars , since Guangzhou Honda , the main player in the field , is already a joint venture , the impact will not be as big as some people imagined .  The important thing is that it must be rapidly developed before the expirations of the protective period .  
We believe that with the concerted efforts of the two sides , our bilateral long-term stable , mutually trusty , neighborly , and friendly cooperation ties oriented to the 21st century will continuously be developed and strengthened .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
[ Li Dingfan ] Our country 's nuclear industry was established in 1955 .  In the past 40 years or so , the industry developed tremendously from scratch and succeeded in developing " two bombs and one boat , " thus enabling China to become one of the nuclear countries in the world , smashing the nuclear monopoly and blackmail by the imperialists and hegemonists , greatly boosting its comprehensive national strength , and making tremendous contributions in maintaining world peace .  
[ Li Dingfan ] For many years while making efforts to enter the international market for peaceful utilization of nuclear energy , China 's nuclear industry has fully developed and utilized nuclear energy resources to serve the construction of the national economy and the livelihood of the people ; constructed many nuclear power projects , such as the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations ; developed newly rising high-tech industries in which nuclear fuel , civilian-use nuclear technology , and production of nonnuclear civilian goods support and complement one another ;  
He said : The friendly cooperative relations between the two armies of Russia and China in the fields of national defense and military affairs have been developed on the basis of strategic cooperative partnership of good neighborliness and friendliness and mutual beneficial cooperation between the two countries .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
At the national border defense work conference held by the central authorities in 1979 , the State Development Planning Commission was instructed to lead more than 10 ministries and commissions to formulate the " draft plan for construction of the border areas . "  Under the situation in which there were a-hundred things to do , the central finance allocated 4-million yuan of special funds in three years running to the border areas for their development and defined specific plans urging the inland developed provinces and cities to support the border minority nationalities areas .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
He pointed out that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Cuba . The two countries ' relations have developed smoothly in recent years .  Particularly since the realization of the mutual visit between President Jiang Zemin and President Castro , the cooperation level between the two sides has risen ; cooperation areas have constantly expanded ; and the Sino-Cuban relationship has entered a period of comprehensive development .  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and Cuba .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have developed rapidly , and the two countries have engaged in very successful cooperation in many fields .  The Chinese side is very pleased with the development , but of the opinion that there is still great potential for the development of bilateral ties , and it takes joint efforts of both sides to continuously expand fields of mutually beneficial cooperation .  
The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
It is precisely because of the implementation of this policy that we have been able to break through the " egalitarianism " that has stifled us for many years , frustrating the people 's enthusiasm , and have been able to fully mobilize and stimulate the great enthusiasm and creativity of workers .  It has greatly liberated and developed productivity , continually raised the masses ' standard of living , and markedly strengthened overall national power .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In recent years , although China 's army computer network has developed fairly quickly , the mutual connectivity between agencies at the regimental level and above has been realized in the majority of units .  However , this situation frequently occurs : As soon as operational training meets with emergency circumstances , computers are abandoned and a return to manual operations ensues , and the more fierce the struggle , the more willing one is to return to " re-operating old-style affairs . "  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
A simulated trainer jointly developed by them for high-speed target tracking by portable missiles has brought about digitized analog simulation for the training on the operational method for striking extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets and has doubled the speed of target tracking .  
If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .  Our army 's equipment development has been carried out in a larger context , ensuring that economic development is the center , and has developed under an increasingly constrained situation .  National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
While vigorously developing agriculture , the DPRK party and government have actively developed the agricultural sideline production and encouraged the people to plant mulberries to raise silkworms and to raise fish and pigs with a view to improving the people 's consumption .  In the meantime , the party and government have launched a nationwide lecture on popular science knowledge to disseminate the knowledge of growing cash crops and breeding animals with economic value .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
they hold that there is nothing wrong so long as the contents of pirated material are neither " yellow " ( pornographic ) nor " black " ( politically questionable } .  If we allow pirating to flourish unchecked , writers will be unwilling to " work " for the pirates , and publishing houses will flinch from an input of several hundred-thousand or several million yuan .  The Commercial Press has developed a CD-ROM of the " Ci Yuan " , but they still do not dare to take it out for fear of piracy .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .

Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
The conclusions and requests coming out of the two meetings are diametrically opposed : The resolution of the Group of 77 Ministerial Conference called for changes to the existing irrational economic order , an appeal from the poor countries to the rich ones , while the document drawn up by the G-8 in the meeting in Okinawa involved regulations and requests by the developed countries with regard to the existing world order , and was more like orders issued by the rich countries to the poor ones .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
On the basis of carrying on tradition , the college has updated its concepts according to the new changes in the new stage and eliminated the past curricular theme of cultivating specialized people with uniquely applicable courses.The college has developed a composite education based on universally applicable courses in order to cultivate " versatile people " that can meet the needs of modern wars .  
The main points of dialectic materialism and historic materialism are : The world is material , unified , and interactively linked , and change is developed from low to high , from simple to complex ;  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The evaluation of authoritative figures regarding all this is that the quality of economic growth has improved somewhat , the various relationships are more harmonious , production and consumption have developed together , and macro and micro are increasing in parallel .  
The professors revealed that Harbin Institute of Engineering has all along played a major role in our country 's deep-dive lifesaving research .  Our country 's deep-dive lifeboats are now equipped with a dynamic orientation system developed by the institute .  At present , the institute is still working on a more advanced dynamic orientation system , which could help maintain orientation in various directions with a power device and enable a rescue vessel to quickly link up with a target vessel even when there is rushing current deep in the sea ;

Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
Over the last 20 years or so , the broad masses of the people have emancipated their minds and acted on an unprecedented historical initiative and proceeded from a highly developed sense of responsibility for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to offer ideas and contribute methods for the reform and opening up and undertakings of modernization drive and actively study new situations and resolve new issues in the light of the actual conditions .

Meanwhile , the current international situation remains relatively complicated .  While peace and development are the main themes at present , hegemonism and power politics still exist .  The unfair and unreasonable international economic order is still playing its role , and the wealth gap between developing and developed countries keeps widening .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .

We have designated pilot units for improving command in field operations , explored command equipment , optimized command groups , made command materials , improved command methods , developed command software , and trained command personnel .  This has made command organs combat effective ahead of the military units .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
Fu Quanyou gave a speech after watching the achievement-exchanges in online drill till its finish .  He said , at this crucial juncture when our army 's modernization drive is advancing toward the 21st century , President Jiang Zemin noted with great foresight : " Using computer technology to carry out simulated training is a prominent characteristic of military training in the developed countries .  
Under the order of their commander , officers and men on an array of combat vehicles which are equipped with devices that have been developed and innovated with high technology are successfully blocking attacks launched by precision-guidance weapons against vital targets ; the operational methods they are employing includes " causing confusion by forming a block with scattered laser absorption , causing confusion with simulated intelligence-based infrared rays , causing confusion by misguiding using the positioning system , and creating spoofing confusion with radar evasion " . .  
To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .  
It has been because we have diligently pursued the main theme of development through hard work , exploration , and advancement that we have developed an excellent situation of prominent growth in our comprehensive national capability , marked improvement in people 's lives , and significant increase in our international prestige and influence .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
Liu : First of all , we must ascertain that development is the main theme .  We are faced with the political pressure of international hegemonism , the pressure from the developed countries with their superiority in high technology , and our arduous tasks in China 's modernization drive .  Only by greatly raising our productive forces , can we build a material foundation to solve all kinds of social problems .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
The whole military and armed police forces have meticulously been carrying out and implementing Chairman Jiang 's " five-sentence " general requirement , and grassroots construction has been consistently strengthened and developed in a healthy manner of comprehensive progress and overall improvement .  From this implementation and construction have emerged a large number of advanced examples with outstanding achievements and moving deeds .  
It has been proved through practice that the military school activities for young people developed in elementary schools and junior middle schools and the military training activities developed in high schools and universities are effective means for conducting national defense education for the youngsters ; therefore , the activities have won common recognition from the students , parents , schools , and society .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with concrete Chinese reality , to give accurate answers to a number of problems : the nature of society and revolution in China , the revolution 's leading class and its allies , China 's unique revolutionary road , etc .  While pointing the Chinese revolution in the right direction , he also creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
The unit has attached importance to the research of the characteristics of camouflage confrontation in modern warfare , and insisted on an integration of expedient material and advanced apparatus , of concealing the reality and showing the false , and of camouflage and protection maneuvers .  As a result , they have developed with innovation a batch of camouflage equipment applicable in actual combats .  
in order to meet the need of maneuver of heavily equipped mass target under the condition of modern warfare , the unit has developed a group of capable personnel , equipment capable of guarding against infrared rays , and a series of thermal imaging camouflage equipment ;  
Sun Yanling , a farmer at the outskirts of Bengbu City , Anhui , lost her life because she left her treatment of illness to " Falungong . "  According to statistics , obsessed by Li Hongzhi 's warped theories and heretical thinking , more than 1,600 people have died because of suicides or because they refused to be treated by a doctor for their illnesses ; 651 people have developed psychological problems ;  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
It was with the spirit of facing the gap , being unwilling to lag behind , striving to catch up with developed countries , being independent and innovative and consistently assailing scientific heights which is upheld by the majority of scientific and technological workers that enabled us to gain our precious foothold in the extraordinarily fierce high-tech competition .  
But since reform and opening up , under the influence of negative social effects and with the intrusive corrosion of overseas criminal syndicates , some criminal groups engaging in various serious felonious activities are gradually appearing in our country .  Their activities are becoming more and more rampant and the scales bigger and bigger .  Some have developed into criminal organizations with the character of a criminal syndicate .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the PLA training institutions at the postgraduate level built a number of key academies or schools ; developed a batch of key academic disciplines ; and set up a number of key laboratories as well , and this was a major decision made by the Central Military Commission .  
For instance , there were no China-made robots 15 years ago , but China has currently developed a group of industrial robots , service-oriented robots , and special robots which are applied to industrial production , work involving high risks , and other businesses .  For example , robots for wall cleaning , pipeline robots , robot-like engineering machinery , contour spraying robots , assembly robots , micro-driving robots , and automatic pathfinders have been on the market for application .  Important achievements have been made with the technique of underwater autonomous deep diving .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
In recent years , as China has developed into a stronger China with continually enhanced international status , which the United States does not like to see , while strategically maintaining ties and economically occupying the China market , the United States has stubbornly played the human rights card , sowed discord between the masses and the government , and frequently caused trouble , interfering in , blocking , and sabotaging the cause of the Chinese people in following the road they have chosen and continually developing and growing stronger .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
High-quality military professionals need to be cultivated through military training through science and technology , military professionals need to master high-tech armament through this training , the highly efficient personnel quota system needs to be tested and completed through this training , and advanced military theories need to be innovated and developed through this training .  
In light of the numerous conjectures about China 's timetable on joining the WTO , Zhang said : China is ready to make joint efforts with the WTO members to finish the talks at an early date , but it is hard for the Chinese side to predict a specific timeframe for its accession because this does not depend on China alone but on the 140 WTO members , especially on the political desire of some developed countries . 
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
Chi Haotian said that China and Qatar established diplomatic ties in 1988 , and relations between the two countries as well as exchanges between the two countries ' military forces have developed ever since .

Numerous facts have proven that US economic development is increasingly dependent on foreign countries and that the more peaceful and prosperous the world is and the more opened and developed the world is , the more it is beneficial to the United States . This all the more requires that the United States and various countries of the world improve their relations and support the peace and stability in the region .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .

The paper 's technical facilities have developed from the mimeographs , planographic printing and rotary letterpress printing of that time to the advanced laser photocomposition systems and satellite transmission systems of today .  Not only can they now print in color , they can receive high quality prints directly from that same day 's People 's Daily and Cankao Xiaoxi .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
These weapons included the army 's Hawk , Tien Kung , Avenger , DMS Stinger portable air defense missile , AII-1W attack helicopter , unmanned reconnaissance aircraft , Thunder 2000 multiple rocket launcher , various types of artillery and tanks , and other advanced weapons .  The Thunder 2000 multiple rocket launcher developed by the Chungshan Institute of Technology and Science was claimed to be a superior anti-landing weapon and the most important item tested in the exercise .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , our priorities of priorities in the field of education will be to make nine-year compulsory education universal and to eliminate illiteracy among young people .  Besides increasing the percentage of the population covered by nine-year compulsory education , we must also make senior secondary education more widespread .  Preschool also must be further developed .

Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
The wireless digital tactical graphic terminal developed by the regiment through cooperation with a certain research institution can transmit real time pictures from the forward position and the front line ; it can also transmit quality still pictures .

These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
To make the new project of aiding and supporting poor areas successful , we call for continued arduous efforts on the part of the party and the people throughout the country and further support from various social sectors and coastal developed areas .

These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
But what Taiwan lacks is not this factor .  Taiwan 's multi-party system and the very lacking and fantastically complex political-economic system including the spiritual state of her social , economic , political fronts , are the results of a relatively developed economy rather than relative backsliding .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .  
The system is also assisted by a higher-orbit surveillance system and a lower-orbit surveillance , with the former formed by four geostationary satellites and two large oval orbital satellites , and the latter comprising several perigean orbital satellites complete with a newly developed vital device called " target sensor " . 
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
Adapting itself to the trend of the times and the actual situation in its own region , it has developed a unique APEC mode , which recognizes diversification , allows flexibility , upholds the principle of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , consensus through consultation , seeking common grounds while reserving differences , and independent and voluntary participation , and integrate unilateral and collective actions on trade and investment liberalization . 
they display the quintessence of the party 's glorious deeds and record the brilliant journey that , over the last 80 years , our party has traveled - - how our party has developed from a small party to a big one , from a weak party to a strong one , and how it has applied itself to struggling for national independence and liberation of the Chinese nation ;  
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .

As a result of implementation in the past six years of this guiding principle for the work in Tibet in the new period , the whole region 's social situation has stabilized , rate of economic growth has increased remarkably , efforts in reform and opening up have gradually picked up , construction of infrastructure facilities including that of energy , transportation and communication has developed fairly fast , local financial revenues have registered a relatively greater increase , and the people 's livelihood has clearly improved .  
In light of this situation , the office has pooled its backbone technical personnel .  After more than one year of hard work to overcome key problems , they have developed a new type of missile for military training .  Compared with regular missiles , these missiles for military training purpose are low in manufacturing cost .  They can be used several thousand times .  Therefore , they are highly welcomed by military units .  
In the development course of our party over the past 80 years , the three generations of the leading bodies of the party separately with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin at the core established and developed the most extensive united front to win over the people 's support and rally strength to the maximum .  The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .  
In the new period of reform , opening up , and modernization , the party established and developed the patriotic united front , extensively united Chinese people at home and abroad , in the course of consistently carrying out the basic line of " one center , two basic points " , to make joint efforts for deepening reforms , expanding opening-up , speeding up development , safeguarding stability , promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao , and promoting the development of cross-strait relations .  Great achievements attracting worldwide attention were achieved in this regard .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : Since the launch of reform and opening up drive and the convening of the party 's 14th National Congress in particular , under the strong leadership of the party Central Committee , the struggle against corruption and reform have deepened constantly ; the economy has developed in a sustained way ; and social stability has been maintained , with the three factors coordinating and promoting with one another and maintaining a sound momentum of steady , healthy , and extensive and intensive development .  
It was learned that the zhongshan Institute of Science and Technology has secretly developed " Taiwan 's Tomahawk " cruise missiles designed for striking at targets 1,000 kilometers away , and the missiles have already been tested for hitting targets several hundred kilometers away .

Party organizations at all levels and the vast party rank and file and party cadres in the central departments must take the lead in studying and implementing Comrade Jiang Zemin 's recent important instructions on strengthening and improving the party 's style building , make great effort to carry forward the good tradition and style developed by the party over a long period of practice , effectively and properly solve the prominent problems existing in the field of style , and take concrete actions to build a good image for the leading organs among the people .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
He pointed out that after the founding of new China , the CPC led the people of the whole country to destroy the imperialist privileges in China and seize bureaucrat-capital and resumed for the people the decision-making rights to independently engage in foreign trade and economic cooperation .  On the basis that liberated areas had already developed foreign trade , a series of major measures were taken to comprehensively set up a socialist system governing foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
The third generation of the leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to and developed Comrade Xiaoping 's thinking of opening to the outside world and intensified relevant theories and practice .

At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
While importing and absorbing internationally advanced technologies , on their own they also research , developed , and set up a technological platform and machinery production base for advanced explosion suppressing materials .

Particularly during the 20 years since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy , China 's national economy has developed in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner ; the social and productive forces , the overall national strength , people 's life and the athletic level have been greatly improved .  
Since the first visit by President Yeltsin to China in December 1992 , the cooperation between the two countries in all fields rapidly developed and the exchanges between the two countries in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural and other fields became increasingly frequent and close .  According to statistics , in 1993 the number of visits between delegations of the two countries above the vice ministerial level reached 25 ; and in 1994 it reached 36 .  
He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .  
Mutual political trust between the two sides has been further strengthened , trade and economic , science and technology cooperation have been gradually expanded , exchanges between local governments and non-government contacts have been constantly developed , and outstanding results have been obtained in cooperation in international affairs .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .

In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
In the last few years , as China 's economy has developed rapidly , bad assets , extending loans in violation of established regulations , financial fraud , losses of state-owned assets , and other problems related to Chinese banks , insurance companies , and other financial institutions have cropped up one after another , seriously compromising healthy development of China 's financial industry and economy and becoming an economic tumor in the country .

Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
Despite Pronk 's proposal not being completely satisfactory , developing countries , keeping in mind the general interests of improving the international ecological environment , finally agreed to accept Pronk 's proposal in order to enable the " Kyoto Protocol " to go into force at an early date and to compel developed countries to take practical and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gases emissions .  
Political consultation and coordination have become increasingly enhanced , with closer cooperation in the United Nations and other international institutions .  Economic and trade relations have developed continuously , trade volume has grown for many years running , and cultural and educational exchanges have been increasingly active .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .

"  
Moreover , the functions of the SDF 's weapons have also been changing rapidly from " defensive " to " offensive .

The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
The " Declaration " calls on developed countries to consider their moral obligation and duty to bridge the growing " digital divide " and to play a positive role in promoting international cooperation , mutual understanding , and peace .

Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
Can China 's cause of socialism be consolidated and developed ?  Can China remain powerful and prosperous in face of the acute international competition in the future ?  The key lies in whether or not our party is able to continuously train a large number of high-quality leading personnel .  
It has also been the common hope of the international community that the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula can be eased , the stability and peace of this region can be maintained , and the South-North relations of the peninsula can be developed and improved to varying degrees .

Useful for developing commerce and trade , the projects have achieved annual production value of nearly 500 million yuan , and have provided employment opportunities for over 10,000 laid off or unemployed persons .  
China today is still a developing country with 1.25 billion people .  Our economic foundation is still fragile .  Although our national strength has grown somewhat , I am afraid that we can not reach the level of an intermediate developed country until the middle of the 21st century .  
A year ago , the Hong Kong media extensively reported on the case of the involvement of Li Youwei 's children in land speculation , saying that Tian X Real Estate Development Company , run by his son , developed villas in Shenzhen Yinhu Holiday Village , which is part of the green area , and that officials responsible for land planning and urban construction granted the land to his son at a price 60 million yuan less than the fixed one .

While inheriting fine traditions , the ideological and political work in the new period has expanded unceasingly in the light of new developments and characteristics and gradually developed a complete set of policies and principles which can be summarized into adherence to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide ; 
Since its establishment , the enterprise 's economic efficiency and social effects have developed fast , to which the contribution of the highly effective ideological and political work can not be left unrecognized .  
Under new historical conditions , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and continuing to draw on fresh experiences , has put forward many new and important ideas and points of view , mapped out a series of interrelated moves , and creatively inherited and developed the theories of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on party building .  
It is precisely because of the unceasing strengthening and improvement of its own development that the CPC has always maintained plentiful vitality and exuberant fighting spirit .  As a result , from a small party of a few dozen members early in the 20th century it gradually developed into a ruling party that had led the Chinese people in becoming masters of their own destiny .  
She pointed out that while opening up wider to the outside world , the western region should pay attention to opening up to other parts of the country , establishing various kinds and forms of economic cooperation with the developed areas in the interior , supplementing each other 's advantages , making great efforts to develop high-tech enterprises , and jointly developing domestic and foreign markets to attain common development .  
Qian Qichen pointed out : During our talks with Albright , we stressed that whether Sino-US relations can be improved and developed and whether China and the United States can establish their constructive strategic partnership is determined by whether the United States follows the basic norms governing the international law of respecting other countries ' state sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrains from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs and truly sticks to the " one China " principle in its acts .  
Its basic characteristic is the comprehensive use of various high-tech information technology [ IT ] developed in the 1990 ' s to conduct rapid , hidden , and destructive damage to the enemy 's military and civilian computer networks and communication systems , cutting off the enemy 's military contacts , disabling command , dowsing the fighting spirit , and bringing great chaos to the economy and society of the country concerned .  This will finally allow the attacking side to achieve the goal of striking the first blows without shedding a drop of blood .  
From Shanghai , Moscow , Alma-Ata , Bishkek to Dushanbe , the degree of military confidence among the five countries along their borders has constantly risen , border problems left over by history have been settled gradually , cooperation in the area of political security has been constantly deepened , consensus over regional and international matters has been constantly expanded , and economic and trade cooperation has developed day by day .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
At a summit meeting held in mid-June in ( Fila , ) Portugal , a heated debate erupted between Britain and both Germany and France over expanding the agenda of government-to-government meeting on EU 's structural reform and over the issue of " strengthening cooperation mechanism " within the scope of the " Amsterdam Treaty " .  The essence of the debate involved the " ' two-speed Europe ' or ' nucleus Europe ' " concept and the fundamental problem whether EU will be developed into a " Federal Europe " or a union of a national nature .

Once an unexpected incident breaks out , the mainland forces will be able to cross the strait and launch a precision strike .  
China is a peace-loving country which has mainly developed her self-defense national defense on her own .  In the meantime , China has also conducted some cooperation with the countries concerned .  Originally , China had signed with Israel an agreement on purchasing an aircraft equipped with an early warning radar on the basis of normal military trade relations between the two countries .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992 , relations between the two countries have developed in a sustained and steady manner .  Their cooperation in the political , economic , security , cultural , and other fields also has scored remarkable achievements .  
6 .  The two countries affirm their identical stands on major international issues .  They hold that international relations in the 21st century should be built on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the established norms of international law , and the dominant position on the United Nations in international affairs should be preserved and strengthened .  They advocate that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means , and that relations between states should be developed on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
Under the joint concern and impetus of the leaders of the two countries , Kazakh-Chinese relations have continually forged ahead ; there are no outstanding contradictions and differences between the two countries , the border problem has been smoothly settled , and economic and trade cooperation has developed in steady fashion .  
This is due to the personal encouragement from the leaders of the two countries .  On the basis of the " Shanghai Five " summit meeting mechanism , both sides have carried out very fruitful cooperation , signed the five-nation border trust agreement , the disarmament agreement , and three joint statements , and developed a brand new mode for building mutual trust and maintaining regional peace .  Meanwhile , they have also greatly promoted the development of the Sino-Kazakh bilateral relations .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
As an important component part of traditional outstanding Tibetan culture , the Tibetan language has been widely studied , extensively used , and greatly developed thanks to the high degree of importance attached to it and the effective protection given by the central government and local government in Tibet .  
As for the orientation of industrial development , according to relevant sources , in the next five years , China will focus efforts on developing high-efficiency and high-quality agriculture and quickening the development of high and new technology industries , including the information industry , biological engineering , new energy sources , and new materials .  The traditional industries will be equipped with high technology .  The manufacturing and machine-building industries will be regenerated , and tertiary industry will also be developed actively .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .

When analyzing the current ideological status of the police contingent , Luo Gan noted : Today , some of our police officers have had a distorted outlook on the world , life , and values ; with shaken ideals and convictions , some have become increasingly indifferent to the aim of their work but have developed a strong desire for privileges ;  
He said that it is only through mutual adaptation to the process of modern civilization , and mutual adaptation to development , progress , unity , and well being of the entire Tibetan nation , that Tibetan national culture can be safeguarded , developed , and continued .

The meeting maintained : During the Ninth Five-Year period , our army 's logistics construction and reform progressed in a comprehensive way , with key areas highlighted , and developed in a coordinated way ; while living an austere life , logistics officers and soldiers throughout the armed forces worked hard , made innovations while opening up new ground in work constantly , and accomplished something significant .  Hence , considerable progress was made in logistics construction .  
Both economic development and the improvement in the ecological environment should depend on progress in science and technology .  Only through using new science and technology achievements to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech industries , and continuously enabling technology to develop by leaps and bounds will it be possible to gradually narrow the gap between the western region and the developed region .  
For more than 20 years of reform and opening up , especially since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the reform of the personnel system relating to cadres , under the leadership of the party Central Committee , has developed and deepened step by step with the progress of the reform of the economic and political systems , scoring tremendous achievements .  This has provided a systematic guarantee for training a contingent of cadres who can fit in with the needs of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
In order to raise the survival capability of missile weapons in actual war , Xu Guangfeng and his comrades-in-arm studied and developed a radar signal radiation simulator that can be used as an electronic interference source or as a chaff device to lure attack by enemy 's anti-radiation missiles .  It has effectively solved a major tactical difficulty for missile weaponry system and greatly raised the survival capability of this kind of weapon in time of war .  
For the first half of the year - - under the leadership of the Party Central Committee , the State Council , committee members at all levels , and all government levels - - all localities carried out and implemented every measure of comprehensive administration of social order , and organized and developed themselves in a timely manner to fight against specific issues .  They centralized areas where public security was chaotic , and focused on outstanding public security problems , carrying out key fixes - - all of which was effective in upholding social stability .  
New and sophisticated technology and suitable advanced technology should be adopted to accelerate the transformation of the traditional industries , that the ability to produce products which are in short supply on the market , which have high technical contents , and which have international competitiveness should be developed , creating new growth points for industrial development .  
Appointment to posts by competition has now developed from being a transitional means in the early stage of instituting the civil servant system into a systematized and standardized method of selecting and employing people by which civil servants are promoted , posts rotate , and people are selected for popular posts ; and the scope of appointment to posts by competition has expanded from middle-grade leading cadres to non-leadership posts and departmental leadership posts .  
Generally , developing countries possess vast land , have huge populations , are rich in natural resources , and have vast markets .  Without progress in developing countries , it will be difficult for developed countries to maintain lasting prosperity .  
Zhang Wannian said : In his military life , Comrade Su Yu defeated his opponent by a surprise move .  He developed a unique art of conducting campaigns and conducted a string of major and ferocious battles , setting many shining fighting examples .  
The developed countries enjoy dominating benefits from the economic globalization while many developing countries are burdened with heavy debts mainly due to long-time colonial rule and plunder , and an international economic order which is unjust and unreasonable .  
We are happy to see that with the joint efforts of both sides , the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries have constantly developed in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Lithuania nine years ago .

The article cited a letter from President Jiang Zemin to International Olympic Committee [ IOC ] President Samaranch expressing support , as always , of the Olympic truce spirit .  The letter said , today , under the IOC 's relentless efforts and the UN 's vigorous advocacy , the ancient Olympic truce tradition has developed into the Olympic truce spirit of the modern times .  It has become a major component of the Olympic spirit , and a positive option for some countries and regions to appropriately resolve regional conflicts and international disputes .  
Chi Haotian said : Sino-Colombian relations have enjoyed a smooth development since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980 , and the two sides have increased exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , and cultural fields .

After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out that since the launch of reform and opening up , Zhejiang Province has adhered to the guideline of simultaneous development of a variety of ownership systems , with public ownership as the mainstay , and continually readjusted and perfected the ownership structure ; while non-public ownership economy has developed rapidly , state-owned economy has also developed by leaps and bounds , its total assets have greatly increased , and its controlling power over the national economy has been continually strengthened .  
If our basic research is not developed and can not reach the advanced international level , we will lack the strength for sustained scientific and technological progress and economic development , and our goal will be hard to achieve .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , our government energetically pushed ahead with the reform of the endowment , unemployment , and medical insurance systems ; made a special point of safeguarding the basic livelihood of employees laid off from state enterprises and ensuring that the pensions for retired employees of enterprises be paid in full , on time ; and developed the " triple-safeguard system , " i.e . the subsistence guarantee system and unemployment insurance system for employees laid off from state enterprises and the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents .  
Wang Yingfan noted that developed countries should further open their markets to developing countries , meet at the earliest possible date the target of raising their official development aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product , and fully and effectively solve the foreign-debt problem of developing countries .  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
It should be soberly noted , however , that ours is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion , a weak economic foundation , and uneven regional economic development , that our per capita output value is not high , and that the gap between our country and developed countries remains very wide .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , under the guidance of the party 's agricultural and rural policies , tremendous changes have taken place in the appearance of China 's rural areas , the rural economy has developed in a comprehensive way , peasants ' income has been notably increased , and stability has been maintained in rural society .  
The coming five to 10 years are a vital period for China to attain economic and social development , an important period to perfect its socialist market economic structure and further open to the outside world , and also a crucial period for catching up with the developed countries in science and technology as well as international competition .  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .

Sino-Vietnamese friendly relations were jointly established and developed by leaders of the elder generation of the two countries .  At the time when extensive and profound changes are taking place in the international situation , the efforts made to strengthen good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries and promote comprehensive cooperation will be of great significance to maintaining peace and stability in the region and the world at large .  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
I hope the vast number of companies involved in every link of modern logistics , including procurement , manufacturing , storage , transportation , consignment , delivery , and marketing , would seize the good opportunity to learn from the advanced experience of developed countries in developing modern logistics , integrate the experience with China 's reality , work hard to explore , push forward the integration of modern logistics and E-Commerce in China , and raise the level of China 's modern logistics as quickly as possible .  
These objectives include : greatly increase the level of overall industrial science and technology and international competitiveness , so as to enable the technological level of China 's principal sectors of agriculture , industry , and the service industry , especially manufacturing technology and equipment , to reach the 1990s level of developed countries and some sectors to enter advanced global ranks ;  
China has successfully launched more than 40 satellites of 15 categories it developed independently .  Of these satellites , the technology in the recoverable satellite has reached the world leading level , and the series of communication , meteorological , resources , and scientific research satellites have gradually been established .  
In another development , the Chinese put on display for the first time an advanced guided missile whose name remains unknown .  Though it was only a model and was attached to the model of the Qianhong 7 aircraft ( namely , the Flying Leopard heavy bomber especially manufactured for its naval air force ) , it has attracted the attention of foreign military experts .  A US military expert who is taking part in the show , believes that is a new supersonic antiradar , antiship guided missile recently developed by the CPC military .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
In the last 12 years since the establishment of their diplomatic relations , bilateral relations have developed smoothly , high-level leaders have carried out mutual visits frequently , and bilateral trade has grown in a sustained manner .  The two countries have already started their cooperation in the economic field .  They share identical or similar views and positions on many major international issues and closely cooperate with each other in international organizations including the United Nations .

Faced with such a severe challenge , the call from international society demanding a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been heightened daily .  Through arduous negotiations , the 1997 Tokyo Protocol stipulated that developed countries must take the lead in shouldering the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions reduction .  This means that by 2010 , the developed countries must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to a level slightly lower than that for 1990 .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
Long Yongtu said : The increasing flow of foreign capital into China is neither based on the condition of decreasing the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries , nor will it have a significant impact on the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries .  Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .  
It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .  The waves of impoverished developing countries opposing the developed countries headed by the United States will certainly surge higher and higher , class struggle will move from a country to the entire world , and the era of peace and development will come to an end , which will be replaced by the new round of revolution and war on a global scale .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
At the same time , the provincial Party committee also enhanced the construction of cultural facilities and cultured ranks and developed abundant and varied healthy recreational and sports activities .  
In addition , China also successfully developed large-scale digital program-controlled switchboards , commercialized modern optical fiber communication systems , made breakthroughs in the key technology for the optical panel point equipment for entire optical fiber communication technology , and achieved significant progress in the third-generation mobile communication technology that China developed by itself .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
An outstanding characteristic of the adjustment of the US Asia-Pacific policy is that it has strengthened contact and dialog with northeast Asia , southeast Asia and south Asia and further developed relations with non-ally countries , even brought about the relaxation of ties with so-called " hostile countries . "  Major headway or historic breakthroughs have been made in these regards .

By leaping development , we mean a development mode or process in which the backward countries or regions , in order to rapidly narrow their gap with the developed countries or regions under specific circumstances , draw on and assimilate the advanced experiences and fine achievements of the latter and , through unbalanced propulsion and supernormal growth , bring about a leap of the overall level of economic development .  
In the theoretical circle , there is also a " theory on the advantages of being a late starter , " which advocates that the temporary economic and cultural backwardness will not stop the newly emerging countries and regions from directly assimilating and using the latest achievements of civilization and catching up with and surpassing the developed countries and regions .  
Abulahat pointed out : For the past five years , three regional industrial structures have been unceasingly optimized , with marked results achieved in industrial restructuring .  The Southern Xinjiang Railway and Urumqi-Kuytun highway have been built successively .  The infrastructure " bottleneck " has been eased significantly ; the open economy has constantly developed ; and the pattern of opening to the outside world in an all-round way has been initially formed .  As the 1987 poverty relief goals have basically been achieved , the people 's living conditions have improved .  
Under the personal care of Your Excellency and Chinese supreme leaders since China and Libya established diplomatic ties 23 years ago , both countries have gradually expanded bilateral exchanges at various levels and rapidly developed friendly and cooperative ties in various fields .

Some developing countries are being pushed farther to the brink [ bi jin yi bu bian yuan hua ] .  
By contrast , the mainland China developed most of its military weapons by itself .  During the same period , it purchased a total of $ 2.59 billion worth of regular weapons from around the world , ranking 14th in the world .  The key country where the mainland China purchased its weapons from was Russia , from which $ 2.12 billion worth of weapons were imported .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "

In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
The water-delivery canal for the east-line project is located in China 's eastern region where the economy is more advanced , township and town enterprises are better developed , and urbanization level is higher .  Thanks to the region 's efforts in recent several years , evident results have been attained in pollution control in the region .  However , the water samples taken from certain river sections in the region still fall below the standard of Class III required for water diversion .

Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street .

With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
Over a thirty year period Taipower steadily developed new power plants until by 1986 , it had accumulated a margin reserve of 50% ( well above the normal level of 20% ) . Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
But associate professor Wang Li-chih of National Taiwan University 's forestry department is not worried that introduced rhododendrons will become dominant species and squeeze out other plants . The hybrid rhododendron cultivars , in which particular features are developed for commercial purposes , actually have weaker constitutions than naturally occurring varieties , and rhododendrons generally choose land " abandoned " by other species : on fertile ground , rhododendron can not necessarily compete with other plants in the wild .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
Venice , that romantic city on the water filled with historic architecture , was the wellspring of European capitalism and the Renaissance , and in recent years has developed into an important international exhibition center for movies , music and architecture . The celebrated film festival and this biennial art exhibition are two of the city 's great achievements .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
Tomatoes ca n't stand high temperatures at night and they are vulnerable to bacterial wilt . AVRDC cultivation expert Chen Cheng-tsu , who has developed a number of excellent tomato strains , is untiring in his continued research on this highly nutritious fruit .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
Following the announcement that British researchers working for PPL Therapeutics had cloned a sheep and the marketing of Viagra by the Swedish firm Pfizer , the stock price of Entremed , a previously unknown pharmaceutical firm , recently tripled in one day after it announced that it had developed a new anti-cancer drug . Thought to have high growth potential , biotechnology stocks have become star performers .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
These expensive anti-aging therapies begin with a thorough physical evaluation . In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
Now that athletic sports have developed to the point of maturity and beyond , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) is very interested in promoting " mental sports . " Thanks to the active support of many Western nations , the incomes of chess players have been slowly catching up with the salaries commanded by professional athletes , and chess has even been selected by the IOC for eventual inclusion as an Olympic event .  
If we developed all our hydroelectric resources to their full potential we would be able to generate over 5 gigawatts of electric power . It is our high mountains that bring down the rain and give us our abundant water . Average annual precipitation comes to 90 billion cubic meters , which gives the island a humid climate and luscious greenery .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment . Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . " CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color . As a result of these efforts , however , he later developed cataracts and lost his sight .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
Jade has always been close to the hearts of the Chinese , and while glass was a glittering and translucent material in the West , inspired by precious stones of varying colors , in China it developed primarily as a jade substitute , having a soft , opaque texture .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
The book is filled with conflict between old and new values . As Chu explains : " If we take the status of the ' desolate man ' - a homosexual role-as a metaphor , it hints that if a culture has already developed to the point where people do not want to reproduce , to create a next generation , sex becomes elevated to an end in itself , and the natural drive to reproduce becomes expended in sexual consumption , in pursuit of sensual extremes . . . .  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
The muscles which join their wings to their thoraxes are well developed , and they can beat their front and rear wings separately to control their direction of flight . Most dragonflies can perform the highly difficult maneuvers of flying backwards or straight upwards , and a few of them can even fly across oceans to make long-distance seasonal migrations .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
From the very start , Yung'an has served as an experimental school for the nine-year integrated curriculum . Taiwan 's textbook publishers are now hard at work compiling textbooks for the integrated curriculum , but they have only finished with the first grade so far . The teachers at Yung'an , however , started working long ago to create an integrated curriculum of their own . Using existing textbooks as reference , they have already developed several integrated textbooks for the second and third grades .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
In The Archaeology of Knowledge , French scholar Michel Foucault observes that as medicine has developed from diagnosis by visual inspection , auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests , its information system has been modified ; and how beside the physician there have appeared masses of data , instruments and analytical techniques which of course he uses , but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient .  
Not far from HCG 's plant , in a Coin Chemical Group specialty chemicals plant , after 40 years of hard work researchers have successfully developed a nanotech battery separator , which greatly raises the efficiency of electrolysis in batteries . This has earned Coin entry to a select group of only four companies worldwide that can make this kind of battery separator . Currently , Coin is both keeping the technology a guarded secret and also considering spinning off its nanotech division as a separately listed company .  
Protection of the local industry has become a leitmotif of the communist authorities ' video policy since 2000 . Fostered by the government , TV series have indeed seen rapid progress . Not only have they developed a distinct dramatic style native to China , they have also taken control of the viewership , and the high rate of return on investment is driving the development of the entire TV industry . Stations in every province are forming into groups that are capable of holding their own against the CCTV .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
Yu used to hold down multiple jobs that kept him racing every day between the hospital , television station , radio station , and newspaper . For years he woke up brutally early to do radio and TV shows , stumbling home dead beat well after sundown . He developed a gastrointestinal problem that often left him doubled over in pain without any advance warning .  
In addition , to cope with competition from low-priced imported rice resulting from Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization , beginning in 2002 Wufeng began cooperating with an agricultural research station of the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) to promote the use of Tainong 71 " Yi-chuan fragrant rice . " This variety , developed by Dr . Kuo Yi-chuan , has round and robust grains , and when cooked gives off a special taro fragrance .  
After the SARS warning was issued , people who had been in a SARS area or who had had contact with anyone or anything having to do with SARS , were classified as " suspected " cases if they developed a fever . If they had abnormal chest radiographs ( showing whitish spots indicating the accumulation of white blood cells and body secretions ) they were classified as " probable " cases .  
According to the data , aside from persons suffering from chronic liver , lung and kidney diseases and the old and infirm , those who exhibit the most severe symptoms are adults aged 20 to 50 . Conversely , children whose immune system has not yet fully developed are able to escape this scourge . This provides evidence for the inference that it is the reaction of the immune system and not the SARS virus itself that kills a person .  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
When the salt fields were initially developed , the lagoons and sand bars at Szutsao Lake in Anping were mainly employed . Using basalt and coral rock from Penghu for dikes , the seawater was first channeled into large evaporating ponds . After initial evaporation , the briny water was channeled into small evaporating ponds where it was further concentrated , and the resulting black brine was channeled into crystallization ponds where exposure to the sun yielded crystallized salt .  
After finding the right tool , and keeping in mind that " it 's all a matter of controlling the force , " after countless broken eggs due to squeezing or pushing too hard , Kuan Chun-mai eventually developed his own creative " knife withdrawal technique " whereby an even , well distributed pressure is applied when withdrawing the knife point from the cut . The principle is roughly similar to the " cue withdrawal technique " used in billiards .  
Just because a famous scholar of Taiwan history branded the movement as leftist , people were afraid to even research this period , and the name of Lai Ho , who led the movement and is known as " the father of Taiwanese literature , " was removed from the rolls of those honored at the Martyrs Shrine . This has really been a bum steer when it comes to the direction in which Taiwan 's culture has developed .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Furthermore , Taiwan cuisine went through a period of study , when it was absorbing the advantages of various Chinese regional cuisines , and it created a new kind of cuisine . This represents an even bigger revolution than the one that occurred after the southward migration during the Song dynasty , when the wealthy all moved to Hangzhou and developed " northern cooking with southern ingredients . "  
After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds . I am always looking forward to meeting new friends anytime and anywhere . I have developed a new attitude toward my future life , and my English has surely improved very much .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
In 1994 Wang Tsai-kuei , a National Taichung Teachers College assistant professor and follower of Neo-Confucian scholar Mou Zongsan , developed a simple , easy-to-implement method to teach children classical texts . The idea was that through leading them in recitation in a relaxed , friendly environment , the children could be influenced gradually by the ideas of grace and integrity contained in some of the most valued works of Chinese literature and philosophy .  
With the rise of the Internet and the digitization of audiovisual content , technologies that were originally developed for the two different forms of transmission for video and telecommunications are using digital signal convergence to enable families to enjoy the interactive pleasures of video-on-demand through set-top boxes . Looking at the world as a whole , the spread of digital content is an unmistakable trend .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
Since the 1990s ecotourism has exploded , especially in developing nations in Latin America , Africa and Asia where there are rain forests . These nations have established numerous nature preserves and national parks , and their outstanding natural resources and unique cultures have attracted growing numbers of tourists from the developed world .  
Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty . Since then , Taiwan tilapia has seen its name changed continually , seen selective breeding applied to improve its stock . As the industry has developed , Taiwan tilapia has continued to expand its territory . Of Taiwan 's 52 main rivers , only two have not become part of its domain .  
Since ancient times , people in the East have for the most part believed that the soul does not perish after death . Egyptians developed mummies , and Taoists in China pursued longevity and deathlessness through alchemy . Even the Buddhists , who viewed the human body as a stinking sack of skin , took bodily incorruptibility as a sign of successful cultivation .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach . Can this approach , along with the increasingly successful development of ecotourism , help create a new future for the controversial highland farming industry ?  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches . Having such a major company recognise their work has encouraged Liao and Chang immensely .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
Through international activities , the ACFTU has developed all round friendly relations with trade unions in other countries , strengthened traditional friendship with trade unions in developing nations , resumeed relations with Western trade unions , and improved relations with the three major international trade unions  
Jiang said that since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1986 , their bilateral relations have developed soundly Frequent contacts between senior leaders of the two countries have helped enhance mutual understanding and friendship , and also played an important role in furthering the bilateral ties , he added  
China is satisfied with Sino Uruguayan ties , which have developed smoothly since the two nations established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , he said , adding that he is convinced that Batalla 's current visit would further develop the bilateral ties  
In recent years , China has established a comprehensive social security system for the aged , set up a system to ensure the basic living standard for urban residents , and also developed numerous community service facilities for older people , which have improved older people 's living conditions , Li added  
he added that local border trade with the former soviet union also developed rapidly last year , the province achieved 1-07-billion swiss francs in border trade with the former soviet union , a 48 percent increased over 1990 in addition , the province 's economic and technological cooperation and labor export increased by a big margin  
One of the main endeavours of the least developed countries is to achieve an optimum balance between human needs and the natural resources base in order to maximize their ability to meet these demands on a sustainable basis .  
Deeply concerned about the disturbing situation that has developed over a substantial part of the territory of the former USSR as a result of armed conflicts with national , religious and political causes ,  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
The right to an adequate standard of living is a universally recognized human right and should serve as a basis from which national and international policies are developed .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
It was also stressed that the computerization of criminal justice systems should be applied at the national and international levels , with due consideration given to the standards prevailing in both developed and developing countries .  
Indeed , after a long period of conservative and incremental technical change , alternative process routes for mineral production are being developed and these are emerging as economically more efficient as well as environmentally less hazardous .  
Among the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual life styles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
The objective is to achieve a rapid and substantial reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality , reducing the differences observed between developing and developed countries , and to eliminate all deaths from unsafe abortion .  
UNU , working with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , has developed a master protocol for comparing the effectiveness of a weekly versus a daily iron supplement in anaemic pregnant women , in adolescent girls and in preschool children .  
The MSI research demonstrated that promising entrepreneurs can be identified and trained , and based on the results of this research MSI developed a compact , costeffective , training programme for identifying and developing local sources of entrepreneurship .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
Despite a renewal in economic growth world wide , the number of people living in absolute poverty has increased in developing and developed regions alike .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
Most developing countries had implemented economic reforms on the advice of the developed countries and international financial institutions , but at great social and political cost .  
The cooperation currently being developed at the international level in the political and economic fields could only be effective if accompanies by strengthened international policies and actions in regard to social matters .  
The total stock of external debt in the least developed countries represented nearly three quarters of their combined gross domestic product .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
Revision of the existing system , which would allow , inter alia , for automatic updating of the scale , with permanent members of the Security Council paying a uniform fixed premium on their regular budget contributions , economically less developed countries benefiting from that surcharge in proportion to their per capita income and economically more developed countries paying the same percentage as towards the regular budget ;  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
The concerted efforts of the international community must be directed towards , and must lead to , concrete programmes of action and the consolidation of an effective platform for international cooperation , with the support of the Secretariat and the agencies of the United Nations system , and also those of the developed countries and world or regional financial bodies for international cooperation .  
Since national legislation varies from country to country and , in practice , the borderline between licit and illicit arms transfers may not always be apparent , measures conducive to [ harmonizing ] [ achieving common ] laws and / or regulations and procedures , [ as well as the means of enforcing them , ] should be developed at the international level to ensure effective control over the acquisition and transfer of weapons .  
The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights of national minorities and indigenous peoples and has established a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea . But for Ukraine , which faces conditions of economic crisis and a complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary infrastructure , services and mechanisms , the task of accommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated persons appears too complicated .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
This is what strikes me , as I now appear for the first time before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of a country such as mine a country with a modest economy , a small population , a territory that is medium-sized but which , owing to its excellent geographical situation , developed more than others ; a culture of social freedom , of mixed races and of political independence , achieved by means of an epic struggle , not only for itself but for all of its American neighbours . 
The recent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakarta issued a renewed call for a new orientation between developed and developing countries whereby constructive dialogue and partnership were emphasized , based on a mutuality of interest and benefit , genuine interdependence and shared responsibility .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
However , our conscience can not rest easy in view of a reality that we can not ignore : the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject poverty , and the challenges posed by the enormous gap between the annual per capita gross national product for the least developed countries less than $ 200 and that of advanced industrialized countries , which is more than a-hundred times higher . 
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
Moreover , the selective policies pursued by some developed countries in liberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist policies which are put in place behind a fa \ x { 84f7 } de of environmental , human rights or other considerations , contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international trade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment of the present imbalances .  We welcome the World Trade Organization as it begins its work .  
In addition , it is necessary to deal with unjust practices in international economic relations such as coercive economic measures , including boycotts , the freezing of assets , the confiscation of property and the prohibition of the export of spare parts , which has been applied by certain developed countries against a number of developing countries , including my own .  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
Nevertheless , we continue to hold the view that unless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the international community , no meaningful progress for the next 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future by the developing countries , especially the least developed among them .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
Mohammed Bedjaoui , whose name , renown and work are intimately linked with the noble objective of strengthening the rule of law based on justice and equity , has shared with the Assembly his exemplary reflections , which will naturally find their proper place in the plans being developed by Member States with a view to launching the United Nations into the next century with the certainty of a future that is brighter than the tumultuous past 50 years of its existence . 
To this end , an institutional infrastructure was developed to promote economic and social development for our peoples through the establishment of a new international economic order , one that would generate more favourable conditions and opportunities for the developing countries to make progress , thus setting in motion a process of evening out the major imbalances between North and South . 
In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
In our view , a speedy recovery from the critical situation of depleting resources requires , first and foremost , that the developed countries honour their political commitments by increasing substantially their contributions to resources on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , especially their official development assistance . 
Understood as a value which encompasses universal pluralism and a genuine acceptance of cultural diversity , the idea of tolerance represents , first of all , a valuable intellectual and practical framework within which the vitally important norms of a good society and a peaceful world can be developed .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
In the meantime , the European Union strongly appeals to all participating States to spare no effort to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the Review Conference , which will significantly reduce the dangers posed by the indiscriminate use of land-mines and contribute to the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines , as viable and humane alternatives are developed , as the ultimate goal of efforts in this field . 
Intensive , short , practical training programmes with emphasis on skills in effective communication , community organization and facilitation of behaviour change should be developed in order to prepare the local personnel of all sectors involved in social development for carrying out their respective roles .  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .  
UNCTAD , when carrying out technical cooperation , should exploit its comparative advantages , ensure complementarity with the related work of other international organizations , intervene on strategic and catalytic grounds and allow for the differentiated needs of developing countries with a particular focus on the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , in accordance with the Cartegena Commitment .  
However , in order to use the limited resources in an optimal manner to meet these different needs a single comprehensive framework of training materials should be developed through modules that would be applicable to countries depending on their status and capability in national accounts .  
In the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual lifestyles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
We should therefore like to stress the importance of advancing in the creation of a true partnership between the less developed and the more developed , at an appropriate pace , as a crucial step in fostering an equitable and peaceful international system at the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
Many of those weapons are being bought , from developed countries , by developing countries that can least afford to dissipate their precious and finite assets for such purposes , and the volume of the trade in light weapons is far more alarming than the monetary cost might lead one to suspect . 
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Establish a group of eminent persons selected through a consultative process and balanced between developed and developing countries , as well as equitably representing all interest groups and the forest products trade , with a mandate to chart a path towards steady progress in international trade in forest products from all types of forests based on sustainably managed forests and the application of criteria and indicators to measure and monitor such management . 
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , and especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development ,  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
As a result of this cooperation , which has a broad base in civil society and non-governmental organizations involved in improving the status of women , the preparatory documents for the Beijing Conference have been prepared and a system developed to establish a national capacity for putting the strategy into operation .  
Recognizing that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action is of particular significance as it will provide an opportunity to the international community to set out new and corrective policies and measures , including strengthened external support to the least developed countries in all areas , to support their efforts so as to ensure the timely , effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade ,  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 3 ] / and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
The chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women , and that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
This was accompanied by a dramatic fourfold increase in developing countries and substantial increase in the former centrally planned economies ( by a factor of 2.4 ) .  7 / In per capita terms , the absolute consumption of fossil fuels in developed countries outstripped by a factor of 9 the consumption level in developing countries , as is evident in table 3 .  
Environmental monitoring data and other relevant information , including consumer information , which are currently lacking in many developing countries , need to be developed urgently so as to provide a sound information base for policy formulation and decision-making on changing the current unsustainable production and consumption patterns .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
The additional post of Economic Affairs Officer requested will be the focal point essential to mobilize the existing expertise and research capabilities required to guide developing countries and least developed countries and strengthen their understanding of these matters and the competitiveness of their enterprises in increasingly globalized world markets and marketing requirements .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Collection and evaluation of information for the development and maintenance of performance indicators ; basic data for least developed countries ; studies , analytical papers and issues notes for technical meetings , including round tables , consultative groups and the Committee on Development Planning , as well as joint publications with regional commissions and other organizations .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
In view of the special importance attached by ECO to the control of drug abuse and illegal trafficking , a comprehensive regional plan has been developed for implementation with the help of concerned international agencies and regional organizations .  
Empowerment in this regard might be perceived as adopting a correct ( technical / organizational ) approach , based on alternative sets of prescriptive rules developed by experts .  
The Canadian costing officer who had led the ad hoc group discussions on the development of major equipment wet and dry lease rates explained the criteria and methodology used .  In achieving fairness , rates had been developed using four factors : generic fair market value of the equipment , the useful life of the item , the potential for loss or damage and , for wet lease arrangements , the costs of maintenance ( consisting of spare parts and repairs ) .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Therefore , as a means of maximizing the potential for such cooperations , triangular funding arrangements buttressed by the active contribution of developed countries and relevant international organizations should be enhanced .  
Indeed , discussion of the issue has never been so extensive : the chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women ; that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate ; and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes should take into account a gender perspective .  
The free and orderly development of financial markets should also be promoted and mechanisms developed to bring about a more stable international financial system which would ensure that increased resources are available to its institutions and that the latter would be capable of detecting , in time , potential exchange-rate and financial crises , which negate the considerable efforts being made by our countries to achieve economic reform , liberalization and stability .  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
The Panel stressed that all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings and expert consultations in support of the work of the Panel should ensure the transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives as well as a balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
Developed country representatives underlined their support for the process through contributions to the two funds : they are both considered important , since it is essential that the high quality of Secretariat work be maintained ; and necessary that developing countries , in particular least developed countries , be well represented at forthcoming sessions of the Committee .  
NULLThe Panel recommended to all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings or expert consultations relevant to the work of the Panel to ensure the open-ended , transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives and the balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
Based on this research , a training programme has been developed to strengthen national and regional capacity for strategic development policy analysis , focusing on tools and techniques that incorporate the local cultural and social context for evaluating the socio-economic driving forces of structural change . 
In the strong belief that concrete , broad strategies must be developed and applied to fight corruption , we reiterate our commitment to adopt cooperation mechanisms to combat that criminal activity because it weakens the democratic system , undermines the prestige of its institutions and constitutes an agent of social disintegration and distortion of the economic system .  
The overriding goal , in this respect , should be to mount a concerted attack on poverty , building on the conceptual framework developed at the Social Summit - in particular the consensus reached in Copenhagen that poverty elimination requires basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods , the advancement of women and an enabling environment , at both the national and international levels .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .  
Despite all the efforts of the international community , particularly the Paris Club and development partners such as France , Germany , Japan , the United States of America , Denmark and Canada , to alleviate the debt burden and cancel part of the bilateral official debt , the least developed countries continued to experience a falling standard of living .  
In order to secure global peace and prosperity , it was essential to close the widening gap between the developed and developing countries and to ensure that development was equitable and sustainable .  
Governments in such regions can do much to remedy intrinsic factors that contribute to that unattractiveness but they will need more help to enable them to meet the financial requirements of sustainable development , for which genuine new and innovative sources will be required , including sources in the developed world .  
There is clearly an inadequate level of implementation of existing conventions and of international rules , regulations and standards , as reflected in the insufficient adaptation of national legislation and procedures , the inefficiency of enforcement and the increasing gap between developed and developing countries in their capacity for implementation .  
It is anticipated that one of the areas to be developed is joint peace-keeping seminars , co-sponsored by national staff colleges and the United Nations , with a view to increasing general knowledge and understanding of peace-keeping for mid-level and senior military and civilian officers .  
Noting also with concern the urgent need to fully address the problem of the combined external debt stock of developing countries , bearing in mind the special and critical situation of the most indebted developing countries in Africa and the least developed countries ,  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
There is danger that , due to scientific / technological backwardness , the Federal Republic may experience a period of " ecologic blockade " after the sanctions are lifted , because its economy will not be ready to meet the demands of the markets of developed countries who are the Republic 's main trade partners .  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change . 
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
In the light of this and against the backdrop of the current climate of budgetary stringency and scarcity of official development assistance , two major policy issues have been identified : ( a ) how to improve aid allocations to the least developed countries ; and ( b ) how to enhance the quality and effectiveness of assistance .  
While the Naples Terms are a welcome step forward , they can have a significant role in providing debt relief only if they are applied to a sizeable part of the total outstanding debt and if the debt stock reduction is extended to a large number of least developed countries .  
Since emissions of pollutants into the environment , including toxic and hazardous wastes , originated primarily in the developed countries , and since the latter 's unsustainable consumption and production patterns continued to be the major causes of the deterioration of the global environment , developed countries should take the main responsibility for protecting the environment .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
By the middle of 1990 , the First Group , with continued foreign assistance , had developed designs and had fabricated and tested a small series of prototype centrifuge machines incorporating carbon fibre rotors and magnetic bearings , the final version of which had a demonstrated capacity of the order of 2 kg separative work units ( SWU ) per year .  
continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Calls upon the international community , particularly developed countries and international organizations , to fulfil all their commitments as affirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular on the effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to enable those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
order to be effective , the operational activities required a continuous , predictable and assured flow of funds especially towards the least developed countries which were in a desperate economic situation .  
this connection , it is understood that the Trust Fund referred to in operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution could be used for payment of a daily subsistence allowance to the aforementioned representative from each least developed country attending the special session , in line with the practice applied under the terms of section XII of Assembly resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , with respect to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;

that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,

Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Also invites the international community to make substantial contributions to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and holding of the World Food Summit as well as to facilitate the full and effective participation of representatives of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , both at the preparatory meetings for the Summit to be held in January and September 1996 and at the Summit itself ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Over the years , UNCTAD has become the main forum for North-South debates , and played a crucial role in the establishment of the generalized system of preferences ( GSP ) , a maritime shipping code , and in setting international aid targets to help developing countries , particulary the least developed among them .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
than ever before it was necessary to observe the essence of " partnership " and " interdependence " in international relations with a view to providing substantial support to structural adjustment programmes in the least developed countries on terms adapted to their needs , as well as additional financial assistance to enable them to alleviate poverty , protect the environment and carry out social programmes .  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
The macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programmes of a wide range of least developed countries had not been successful during the first half of the current decade owing to an overall unfavourable external environment .  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
conceptual framework incorporating socio-economic and gender analysis at the macro ( inter-household ) and micro ( intra-household ) level with people 's participation and conflict resolution has been developed and is being operationalized through a socio-economic and gender analysis field manual accompanied by an open-ended series of technical supplements , which will be concise , sector and subsector specific guides to utilizing the socio-economic and gender analysis paradigm .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
The Committee agreed to continue at its sixteenth session , the preparation of general recommendations on article 7 of the Convention on the basis of the working paper prepared at its fifteenth session and an additional text to be prepared and supplied to members in the working languages of the Committee well in advance of the sixteenth session .  The working paper was prepared after reviewing the draft developed at the Committee 's thirteenth session and in the light of developments in the interim .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
The agreements of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 , the rapid redefinition of economic groupings in the developed countries , and the ever more important role of private capital in the world economy , have created a new international environment in which the interests of Africa do not seem to have been taken into account , or in which they are even threatened or compromised . 
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
They should , inter alia , pave the way for the active and global participation of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , in the work and procedures of the United Nations , including the Economic and Social Council , bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these countries in the economic and social challenges facing today 's world .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints faced by various developed countries , clarification of foreign aid objectives , revised conditions governing the granting of assistance , and the heightened competition among various regions for aid packages constitute a serious challenge for developing countries such as mine .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
I am pleased to say that , through decisive action rather than words , we have made genuine strides in enlarging our dialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide , developed and developing alike .  
The changes affecting the international economic scene following the crystallization of the concept of economic globalization and the liberalization of trade-mandate corrective measures require that the existing disproportion be corrected , particularly since the behaviour of certain developed countries in trade liberalization is still marked by a selective approach .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
In this new era of heightened interdependence , a lack of solidarity still characterizes international relations , and self-interest is persistent in terms of both security and development , emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that can effectively narrow the growing gap between developed countries ever more prosperous and stable and a developing world faced with poverty and disorder of every sort .  
It recognizes the efforts of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to incorporate social development into their policies and programmes in a variety of ways and more intensively than in the past , as well as the urgent need for the international community to make efforts to reach as soon as possible the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance .

In addition , comprehensive media support , based on permanent cooperation with the mass media ( national radio and television services , regional radio services , press ) has been developed and gradually strengthened by :  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation also expressed the urgent need for the international community to call upon certain developed countries immediately to eliminate laws and regulations with adverse extra-territorial impacts and other forms of coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
The overall objective , strengthening civil society , is pursued on a country-by-country , regional , interregional and global basis , through the provision of assistance to national non-governmental organizations in the form of training courses on human rights , fellowships and support of appropriate projects developed by them .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
Now that the countries of the Rio Group had implemented the adjustments and modernizations required for their social and economic development , and in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation and the International Development Strategy , it was to be hoped that the developed countries would also assume their responsibility to create a favourable international environment for cooperation and economic development , especially with regard to the developing countries .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
Expressing her delegation 's strong interest in pursuing durable solutions , she cited the innovative and comprehensive approaches developed by UNHCR for addressing population movements and said that voluntary repatriation should combine the elements of sustainable development , a community-based approach and a focus on returnee communities .  
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction the close and effective cooperation developed with United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and other competent bodies , including non-governmental organizations , to foster international solidarity with a view to promoting the realization of children 's rights , in particular in the light of articles 4 and 45 of the Convention . 
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
Moreover , the willingness and psychological capacity of the developed countries to provide asylum and support were diminishing ; that had been reflected in decreased aid and an increase in restrictive practices that circumscribed the right of asylum , particularly if persons happened to be from different ethnic or cultural backgrounds . 
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
It is a matter first and foremost of the lives and well-being of millions of innocent people who depend on this carrier to avert the dangers of deadly and lethal diseases in a country that is classified as among the least developed countries whose limited possibilities and scarce resources , as mentioned , are well known to you .  Accept , Sir , the assurances of my highest consideration .  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
The President of Mongolia , in his address to the General Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , had emphasized the importance of developing a set of ground rules for the pacific settlement of disputes , an idea further developed by Mongolia 's Prime Minister in his recent address to the General Assembly when he had called on the international community to elaborate the guiding principles for conducting international negotiations .  
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered . 
Reports should also indicate the activities and programmes developed , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the target groups identified , including by age , gender and national , social and ethnic origin , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities established , and the consideration given to the aims of education as identified by article 29 of the Convention , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered .  
The cultural , artistic , recreational and leisure activities , programmes or campaigns developed and provided at the national , regional or local , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels , to ensure the enjoyment of this right including in the family , in the school and in the community ;  
Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Finally , once the target has been identified , a plan of action needs to be developed to meet the objective ; section III thus gives an integrated presentation of ISWGNA work programmes , highlighting recent achievements and reviewing proposed priority areas for future work in the light of expressed country needs .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
Noting that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
A single , integrated international database containing extensive basic statistics and indicators covering a wide range of topics in these fields is being developed for wide dissemination pending the provision of extrabudgetary support .  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Reaffirms also the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ; 
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular , to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
All available tools - trade , investment and structural adjustment - must be brought to bear on the problem of the marginalization of least developed countries , and there must be close cooperation between WTO , various organs of the United Nations system , the Bretton Woods organizations , and the various regional bodies to ensure that the resources and expertise of the international community remained focused , coordinated and relevant to the most pressing global needs . 
Commenting on the need to assist many developing countries , especially the least developed countries , with the promotion of exports , he said the EU had taken note of the suggestion in the Trade and Development Report 1996 for establishing an international marketing and information service , but was of the view that such assistance should take place at a level as close as possible to the relevant industry and be based upon detailed understanding of export capabilities .  
The representative of Australia complimented the secretariat on its analysis of factors contributing to dynamic growth in East Asia and noted that the Trade and Development Report 1996 pointed to the important role in the growth of economies in the region played by the rapid expansion of exports of labour _ intensive manufactures to major developed countries . 
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;

Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;

Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .  
For the appropriate management of high seas fisheries as well as that of the exclusive economic zones , the developed countries should transfer the necessary technology to developing countries to enable them better to conduct scientific research , handle data and pursue fisheries operations in a more responsible manner .  We now face the formidable task of implementing the comprehensive global framework of ocean management .  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;

Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Mechanisms should continue to be developed within the United Nations to give the nominated representatives of indigenous organizations and peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice and take part in decision-making in the search for solutions to the problems faced by their peoples .  At its fifty _ second session , the Commission , by decision 1996 / 102 , established an agenda item entitled Indigenous issues .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
In fact , we are aware and convinced that merely meeting the requirements of the ritual of holding periodic elections is not enough and can in no way be considered decisive in establishing and guaranteeing lasting democracy in a country , particularly in a developing country such as my own , which is classified among the least developed .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Nevertheless , there is now a strong signal to developed countries to commit at the upcoming Kyoto meeting on climate change to legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for greenhouse gas emissions .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Strengthened international cooperation and the application of appropriate national policy will also contribute to ensuring a stable environment conducive to promoting social development , including reduction of unemployment and generation of productive employment in developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
At its third session , held in Argentina in November 1996 , the Conference of Parties to the Convention decided on a future programme of work for terrestrial biological diversity , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Convention secretariat to develop , in consultation and with the assistance of the Panel , or any successor arrangement , a focused work programme on forest biodiversity that would place an emphasis on research .  FAO has a forest genetic resources programme that has been developed over the past three decades .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
A partnership for development should be forged in which developed and developing countries would undertake , in a framework of growing interdependence and joint responsibility , to establish sensible national policies and an international climate conducive to sustainable and accelerated development .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
In the fourth review and appraisal , representatives of non-governmental organizations have been included in 31 ( 72 per cent ) of the national coordinating mechanisms : 48 per cent in developed countries , and 62 per cent in developing countries , a slightly higher level than that reported in 1992 .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
An international collaborative research initiative , PLEC is based on a comparative network of locally based research clusters ; five are now operational in West Africa , East Africa , Montane Mainland South-East Asia , Papua New Guinea and Amazonia , and a sixth is being developed in the Caribbean region .  
In this regard , the promulgation of strict legislation to control transboundary movements of dangerous wastes should be continued and , in particular , encouraged in the developing countries in order to reduce the discrepancies between the national legal norms applied in the developed and the developing countries .  
Also with regard to the United States , the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her particular appreciation of the comprehensive training module developed since 1982 by the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , which is responsible for carrying out law enforcement training programmes on juvenile delinquency .  Since 1983 , training programmes on child abuse and sexual exploitation investigative techniques for local law enforcement officials have also been held nationwide .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Harnessing the positive potential of development and trade is also being developed in other key areas of the Convention , such as access to genetic resources ; intellectual property rights ; technology transfer ; and social and economic incentives .  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Its strategy was based on a number of measures , which were summarized as legislative provisions in the areas of proceeds of crime , improvement of law enforcement capabilities , relying on the assistance and expertise of other countries that had already experienced organized crime problems and had developed methods to prevent and control it , better coordination among the relevant national authorities and improved international cooperation .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
To this end , the resident representatives worked in partnership throughout 1996 with all relevant headquarters units , particularly with ( a ) the regional bureaux , which provided the supporting management framework , advice , training and , together with the Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) , assistance in matching core competencies with country office needs and ( b ) the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support ( BPPS ) , which supplied analytical tools , developed in consultation with country offices , global studies and methodological guidance .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
The international community and international organizations were requested to support national initiatives and implementation of the targets set in the Platform for Action , including the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Even though there was no specific mention to this effect in the response received from the Netherlands , it is known that the country , along with other developed countries , such as Japan , participates in triangular arrangements , whereby the services of suitable developing countries are utilized to deliver a technical cooperation input to another developing country .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the least developed and landlocked developing countries have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and other international declarations .  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Governments are needed to create the conditions that will allow consistent and realistic goals to be developed and met goals that are based on good science and the sound assessment of risk , and which balance ecological , economic and social objectives .  
The most complex processes now being experienced by developed societies , including new forms of racism , are a direct consequence of deregulated economic activities at the international level and of an inequitable and " wild " process of globalization .  
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
This is the most important resource possessed by our country , and the level of scientific development now attained is manifest in the existence of some 60 scientific research centres and an established body of scientists and research-workers that place Cuba on a level comparable with a number of averagely developed industrialized countries .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .  
In the Midrand Declaration , 7 member States of the Conference stated that it should be recognized that countries entered the new rules-based system of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) from very different starting points ; that , accordingly , the impact of globalization and liberalization was uneven ; and that the least developed countries , particularly those in Africa , remained constrained by weak supply capabilities and were unable to benefit from trade . 
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
Debt-relief measures for the least developed countries would help to release scarce resources in order to boost social and human development expenditure and to finance investment in critical economic restructuring in the short term and medium term .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
In order to increase the representation of women at the Professional level , FAO developed strategies to identify suitable female candidates and established a roster of international experts working in the area of women in development to be considered for future vacancies .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
Takes note of the work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in the field of the human genome to complete the preliminary draft of a universal declaration on the human genome and human rights , a standard _ setting framework urgently needed to ensure that such research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human dignity , in particular for the dignity and way of life of indigenous peoples ;  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons . 
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It was agreed that inter-agency coordination could be pursued by creating an interactive electronic mail network for information-sharing to serve as the medium for inter-agency contacts ; preparing an inventory of social programmes and projects ; conducting joint human resource training activities ; expanding to the rest of the region the system developed by CEFIR for observing the behaviour of social actors in integration ; and comparing the various work programmes in order to identify issues appropriate for inter-agency cooperation .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
The Committee notes that the Governing Council of UNEP , in its decision 19 / 31 of 7 February 1997 , requested the Executive Director to strengthen the regional offices of UNEP by providing them with appropriate functional and administrative capabilities to enable decentralized implementation of regional environmental programmes and priorities , as developed by regional and subregional ministerial meetings .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
An important medium of education and the heightening of awareness has been the " New Home , New Life " radio series developed by Mr . John Butt of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , which incorporates cultural , social , economic , human rights , peace , health , conflict resolution , mine awareness and other issues of vital daily importance for the population of Afghanistan .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
In this connection , we express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for his initiative , in cooperation and coordination with the relevant international organizations , to assist the least developed countries to formulate integrated country programmes for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services , pursuant to the relevant decision of the Trade and Development Board at its annual session last year .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
In order to provide a pragmatic focus for the broad and ideal goals of the Plan of Action during the second decade of its implementation , a practical strategy on ageing was developed in 1992.3 The strategy consists of eight global targets on ageing for the year 2001 and 38 suggested national targets on ageing . 
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of peace and security ; strengthened and broadened the observance of human rights ; enhanced and developed international law and widened the scope of international penal law , in particular ; and laid the foundations for greater responsibility by States in the advancement of social progress .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
Unless the developed countries fulfil their commitment to reach the United Nations accepted target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and intensify their efforts to reverse the present downward trend , hopes for the least developed countries will remain as grim as ever .  
As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
These actions have strengthened the role of the University and allowed for alternative ways of improving quality of living , achieving sustainable development and contributing to the progress of less developed cultures .  
During his tenure of office , thanks to his outstanding leadership and his remarkable managerial skill , the Agency has developed into an international body of exemplary effectiveness and efficiency , faithfully fulfilling the objectives and principles set out in the Agency 's statute .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
To most developing countries , the sustainable development approach , as emphasized by most of our developed partners , is considered restrictive , limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment .  
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
In discussing its terms of reference , Committee members attached particular importance to ( a ) assessing world development trends and prospects ; ( b ) identifying national and international policies that would enhance the ability of developing countries and economies in transition to participate effectively in a globalizing world economy and achieve the goals agreed at United Nations global conferences ; and ( c ) undertaking periodic reviews of the list of least developed countries and the criteria used for identifying them .  
The Committee agreed to examine the following issues related to the impact of globalization on development : ( a ) globalization trends in trade , capital flows and technology transfer ; ( b ) factors leading to a homogeneous policy regime and its implications for development ; ( c ) implications of globalization for the international economy and international governance ; ( d ) recommendations for national policies , institutions and governance in developing countries ; ( e ) recommendations for policies in developed countries ; and ( f ) recommendations for policies of international organizations .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
While the proportion of people in absolute poverty may have been reduced as a result of rapid economic growth in some very large low-income developing countries ( notably China and India ) , the process of globalization has been accompanied by an increasing economic gap between the high and middle-income countries and the least developed countries . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
They emphasized the need for innovative approaches to address the complex and specific migratory flows that were taking place in the CIS States and highlighted the specific international standards that had been developed under the Programme of Action to address modern forms of involuntary and enforced migration , including forcibly displaced persons .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
In addition , China has developed rewarding systems for young people such as the Ten Top Chinese Young People , prominent young entrepreneurs , prominent young township entrepreneurs , young technical pace-setters , young skilful workers at their posts , rural young shooting star guides , the Chinese young scientist prize and Chinese youth science and technology pioneering prizes .  
One set of concerns focuses on the environmental , economic and social consequences of the resource-intensive consumption patterns of the developed world - and , increasingly , the rapidly industrializing countries - another on the multiple problems bound up with economic stagnation , poverty and environmental degradation in some developing countries .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations common system to develop and submit proposals to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
The same year , the annual party congress of FRELIMO decided to adopt the classical Soviet model for the organization and development of the country , and the Government developed close links with communist and socialist countries .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
The intense work undertaken during the interim period has laid some of the needed foundations for the necessary convergency between the efforts of affected country Parties and developed country Parties , thus paving the way for gradual progress at the field level of the arid lands marginalized by ecological degradation and poverty .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Governments and international organizations should apply , as soon as possible , the 20 / 20 concept and the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance , as accepted at the World Summit for Social Development and reinforced in the Platform for Action in a gender-balanced way .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
The topics discussed included the varying experiences of world regions regarding mortality , epidemiological and health transitions ; the problems faced in measuring mortality levels and mortality by cause of death , particularly in developing countries ; the various approaches to the measurement of health status and their limitations ; the health and mortality situation in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries ; and the relevance of risk factors underlying major causes of death for the formulation of health interventions .  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
In addition to the economic shocks , the legacy of communist rule in these countries was probably much more unfavourable than in central Europe : more ruthless regimes ensured that there was little , if any , reform before 1989 , and there was little opportunity for the emergence of opposition parties which might have developed coherent alternative programmes when eventually presented with the opportunity of taking over Government .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
These conflicting perceptions and the underlying policy dilemmas could be reconciled better in the context of a more comprehensive and global policy dialogue designed to promote coherent policies in all countries for more balanced growth and development and to reduce unemployment in developed and developing countries . 
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Members will recall that , on the occasion of that historic event , the debate about our common future was often polarized into the choice between rural sustainability and urban migration , between the green agenda and the brown agenda , between developed and developing economies .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
History has shown that the huge present-day inequalities between developed and poor countries are the result of centuries of plundering and exploitation during which civilizations , social structures and indigenous modes of production were destroyed and during which the ecosystems of Africa , America and Asia were pillaged .  
Nationally and regionally coordinated strategies should be developed for the implementation of the mandates and recommendations contained in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session , 1 / on 23 February 1990 , the Tehran Declaration adopted by the Ministerial-level Conference at the twenty-ninth session of the Subcommission , held at Tehran in 1992 , and other relevant international drug control instruments ;  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
Thailand 's space activities had developed in tandem with global space technology ; his delegation therefore appreciated the role played by COPUOS in strengthening international cooperation and norms for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , and fully supported the draft declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space .  
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
Its current social security scheme was undergoing a period of complex reforms and unemployment insurance was being developed , with emphasis on the promotion of economic activity of the unemployed in small towns and in rural areas , as well as the disabled .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
While it was currently agreed that economic globalization and the laws of the market had become the new rules of the game , the conditions in which the game was played were far from equitable and had aggravated the economic disparities between developed and developing countries .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
In addition , the formulation of national plans and their implementation would help create a favourable social , economic , political , health , educational and family environment for children , in both developed and developing countries .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
France is making a contribution to the Odin scientific satellite developed by Sweden and intended for the observation of the as yet unstudied electromagnetic spectral bands situated in the neighbourhood of wavelengths between 0.5 and 3 mm .  
Looking back at its record over the last 30 years , the Conference has developed an impressive set of international legal instruments that addresses in a comprehensive manner the security challenges posed by weapons of mass destruction .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Further , widespread discrimination based on gender , ethnicity and religious belief is reported daily and extreme poverty and marginalization is the fate of many in both developing and developed countries .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
At the same time , the Convention in other parts developed and codified many rules which were generally agreeable or even favourable to the industrialized States also ( e.g . related to the territorial waters or the exclusive economic zones ) .  
AOUIJ said that , although the extent to which political power was shared between women and men in Denmark constituted a model for developing and developed countries alike , economic power was not shared to the same extent .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring countries facing the Bay of Bengal and the quick notification of imported cases of this strain in developed countries raised global concern about a possible new pandemic of cholera .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
This ongoing work programme has developed a working list of indicators of sustainable development , divided into four categories social , economic , environmental and institutional .  
ECA has developed extensive collaborative relationships with the various global entities , regional and subregional organizations involved in economic and social development in Africa .  
It is for this reason that the logistic regression model was developed from , compared to and tested with the electronic claims for which the type of loss had been ascertained before being applied to the set of claims for which the type of loss was unknown .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , on a global scale the international community has moved forward slowly and has made only modest progress so far .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
The broad base of users was one reason why satellite communications had developed into a strong market , while the remote sensing data market was still in a somewhat developmental stage , although slowly growing .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .  
For instance , technology for space _ based extra _ atmospheric lightweight kinetic projectiles developed in the cold war is being used to develop a Navy Area Defense System capable of intercepting targets in outer space at an altitude of 500 km .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
But it was also necessary to cast a critical eye on the regulations applied in the global market , which was subject to far less rigorous supervision than that exercised by the national mechanisms of stable , developed economic systems .  
The target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the developed countries gross national product to official development assistance , which had been considered the absolute minimum two decades previously , now looked like an unattainable dream .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .  
Such treatments shall be applied in a determined scale to intermediate developed countries , and in a more favourable manner to countries at a relatively less advanced stage of economic development ; and ( e ) Multiple , to make possible various forms of agreements between member countries , following the objectives and duties of the integration process , using all instruments capable of activating and expanding markets at regional level .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
Urge developed countries and relevant organizations to review their international assistance in forestry to improve institutional capacities of developing countries , to base their assistance on the priorities identified in the national forest programmes of recipient countries , to increase effectiveness of available resources , and to increase their ODA contributions ;  
Since its foundation , the United Nations has developed a broad range of international standards , guidelines and model treaties in crime prevention and criminal justice that represent internationally agreed upon principles of desirable practice based on the rule of law .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
Turning to the question of trade and development , he said that , while trade liberalization was expected to bring about a considerable increase in global income , it must be recognized that , since the early 1970s , the least developed countries had suffered a cumulative decline of 50 per cent in their terms of trade , while the developing countries as a whole had lost $ 290-billion between 1981 and 1991 , which could be attributed to the decline in commodities prices . 
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
In that context , apart from increasing its annual contribution to UNRWA , Cyprus had in 1996 developed its own scheme of assistance to the Palestinians which included , inter alia , the construction of two medical centres in the West Bank , at a cost of $ 2.2-million , and a comprehensive programme of technical assistance and training for some 100 Palestinian officials , including follow-up visits by Cypriot experts to the autonomous areas .  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
In 1994 , it developed a plan of action to correct present imbalances in the participation of men and women in political life , and has collected statistical data on the outcome of legislative elections with respect to gender , maintained a Web site and issued statistical surveys on this subject . 
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Comprehensive revised guidelines for these types of contracts have been developed and will be implemented in 1999 , bearing in mind the primary objective of achieving value for money in an efficient and expeditious manner .  
This quite simple backbone or table of contents of issues to consider when drafting a competition law is then complemented in Part II of the Model Law with detailed commentary to the articles , in which a review is made of actual laws in both developed and developing countries , as well as countries in transition , with a view to determining the most recent trends and views on how best to treat each one of the issues considered in the elements for articles of the law contained in Part I .  
It takes place primarily between developed countries in the application of bilateral enforcement agreements , mutual legal assistance treates ( limited to criminal action aginst cartels ) , free trade , customs union or common market agreements , and the relevant OECD instruments . 
In addition to the need to underscore , for all concerned , the key role that the quality of public information and communications activities plays in the effectiveness and success of peacekeeping operations in the field , the Department has developed cooperative mechanisms , enabling it to provide the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other concerned departments with all the programmatic support necessary to undertake appropriate information programmes .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
Using the new UNIDO methodology , a preliminary integrated approach was developed which will address three main priorities : ( a ) contributing to an efficient , stable energy supply by improving the output of existing mini-hydro power plants and exploring alternative energy sources ; ( b ) providing general management training in basic industries and upgrading technical skills in priority sectors ; and ( c ) improving the access of the manufacturing sector to market intelligence services .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
Many delegations believed that modern information technology and a transparent information network were key to progress and development , and were keenly aware that the gulf between developed and developing countries in the global information network remained wide . 
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ; special issues of least developed countries / Africa / heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
Many delegations stated the belief that modern information technology and a transparent information network were key to progress and development , and were keenly aware that the gulf between developed and developing countries in the global information network remained wide . 
Surplus personnel have been disarmed and their identification cards withdrawn ; offices have been arranged by function rather than ethnicity ; senior staff have begun to hold regular joint meetings ; policies for bomb threats and explosion cases have been developed ; security plans for the return season that is beginning have been established ; and some inappropriate political symbols have been removed .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
In all such modifications , the Commission shall take into account the state of the technology being developed , the processing system utilized , the value and potential use of any waste , the environmental effects of the activities , the economic and resource data , and the international need for the mineral resources .  
Forms of participation by resident non-citizens should also be developed , including local voting rights after a certain period of residence and inclusion of elected non-citizen observers in municipal , regional and national legislative and decision-making assemblies ;  
Facing the growing threat of a global deflationary spiral , central banks in the major developed economies , led by the monetary authorities the Federal Reserve System or Fed of the United States , started to ease monetary policy in the autumn of 1998 .  
During short-term microgravity experiments on board aeroplanes , research will be conducted on the correlation between the electrophoretic direct current field and the variable gravity field with electrophoretic instruments for continuous free current stream in space and equipment for life science experiments on manned space missions will be developed and relevant scientific research initiated .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
The Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office is currently analysing the data to identify pilot or other opportunities for common arrangements to be carried out under memoranda of understanding among participating agencies ; identifying existing umbrella-type or joint contracting agreements that may be further utilized and developed under such memoranda ; and proposing for signature a standard inter-agency memorandum of understanding that provides the basis for common procurement arrangements .  
With regard to the issues of poverty , economic development and environment , we note with regret that the draft document failed to address the crucial and urgent need to establish better understanding at the international level , and a high level of international cooperation that will enable the developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular to realize success in these fields .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .  
Recognizing that they both take a substantive interest in areas of common concern and are committed to promoting a more comprehensive and relevant treatment of the subject matter while avoiding unproductive duplication and inconsistency of recommendations , the two Commissions have developed an elaborate coordinating mechanism .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
It should be mentioned that following consultations with non-governmental organizations acting in the field of HIV / AIDS and representatives of United Nations agencies working in Romania , it was decided to set up a national multisectoral AIDS commission to examine the potential spread of AIDS and its consequences for the Romanian population and to assess the programmes developed so far with a view to working out a national strategy against this dreadful malady .  
On the basis of the Cairo Programme of Action , Benin has developed a strategy we call the common minimum social welfare programme , aimed at improving the quality of life of families and covering a set of basic needs in five essential areas : health , education , food , developing people 's ability to create wealth , and opening up communities . 
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
Opinions were sought also from experts in restrictive business practices in some developed countries and international organizations regarding the quality of the analytical studies prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat and the commentaries on the model law , which are revised periodically .  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
They had also given themselves a goal of full cost recovery within five years , and the objective was being realized by providing their target group of firms at the initial stage of operation with a free diagnostic service ( based on the diagnostic tools developed by CODETI , among others ) ; thereafter , a fee based on the outcome of the diagnostic exercise and the projected savings to be made by each firm would be negotiated with the particular client enterprise .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Considering that commercial mining has the potential to impact vast areas of the seafloor , the scientific experts developed a proposal for a cooperative research project involving in situ manipulative field experiments under carefully controlled conditions . 
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .  
Nevertheless , concern is expressed at the lack of practical implementation of these principles , in particular that the child 's right to express his / her views in a judicial or administrative procedure affecting him / her , as established in article 17 of the Code on Children and Adolescents , may not be respected in all cases in a culture where respect of the views of the child is not fully developed . 
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
The Board observed that , in the short to medium term , improved agricultural performance offered many of the least developed countries the most effective way to raise economic growth rates and expand and diversify exports .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
An expeditious accession process for the least developed countries which were not members of WTO , on terms consistent with their status , was seen as an integral part of their efforts to reverse their current marginalization in world trade and to become integrated into the world economy and international trading system .  
The international community committed itself , in the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action , to urgent and effective action , based on the principle of shared responsibility and strengthened partnership , to arrest and reverse the deterioration in the socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and to revitalize their growth and development .  
The international community , particularly the developed countries , collectively committed itself to a significant and substantial increase in supporting the efforts of the least developed countries to mobilize and develop their human capacities and the development of their economic base .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
It is now a fully functioning international criminal court , holding regular hearings , with a normative framework completed and in operation and close and productive working relationships developed with international organizations working in the former Yugoslavia .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
Ways should be found to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the formulation of international standards , a very costly process , and gain access to mutual recognition agreements concluded progressively among developed countries ( and which discriminate against developing countries ) , as well as to meet sanitary and phytosanitary regulations .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
The asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks arising from globalization warrants a global social contract between developing and developed countries , based on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility and with the active involvement of non-State stakeholders with a view to creating a rule-based international system where all countries could take full advantage of the process and where the stronger countries recognize and respect the constraints of the weaker ones .  
Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
Of course , evolution of the international situation means that it is appropriate for existing rules of international law to be developed and adapted to prevailing conditions , but this should be done through collective discussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions , not as a fait accompli and not working from scratch : it should be based on valid rules of international law .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
On the other hand , commitments undertaken under IMF / World Bank Structural Adjustment Programmes have reinforced and widened WTO commitments and accelerated the adoption of non-reciprocal autonomous liberalization measures , and bilateral agreements with major developed countries have further reduced the remaining policy options and WTO flexibility . 
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Notes with appreciation the growing number of developed countries participating in triangular cooperation and encourages the use of such cooperation by other countries and , in this context , requests the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the countries that have been supporting such cooperation , to document and disseminate relevant lessons learned and to identify options for the exploitation of the full potential of such cooperation ;  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Given the special difficulties faced by African countries in their effective participation in the multilateral trading system , the workshop held at Pretoria also addressed their specific concerns , taking into account the outcome of the Coordinating Workshop for Senior Advisers to Ministers of Trade of least developed countries in preparation for the WTO Ministerial Conference , held at Sun City , South Africa ( 21-25 June 1999 ) .  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
Our presence here is proof of the fact that , astonishing though it may seem , the newly developed media and means of communication can not satisfy the need human beings feel for personal and direct contact in order to establish a dialogue conducive to peace this fact was certainly not lost on the founding fathers of the United Nations system .  
Recognizing that , while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty through the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with a long-term perspective ,  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
More coherent policies , established on the basis of broad consensus , should be developed , bearing in mind the need to respect the principle of sovereignty and to ensure flexibility in the policies affecting developing countries , particularly in areas such as the management of capital flows and the choice of capital account regime .  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
The administrative and technical structure of primary health care has been developed at the central and local levels in such a way as to constitute an integrated system conducive to the promotion of development through collaboration among all the sectors concerned with health and development .  
The therapeutic sector must be strengthened , modernized and developed through the establishment of health institutions , provided with the requisite modern equipment and facilities and qualified medical staff , in all parts of the Syrian Arab Republic .  
The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the internship system have been developed and the Ministry awards 40 specialized medical diplomas after theoretical and practical training in accordance with the most up-to-date scientific syllabuses .  
Sharing experiences and information , improving capacity of responding to the specific needs of women within the environment where they operate , improve the quality of the actions developed and , so that they can work in articulation with the Commission , as well as in cooperation with social and economical agents at the councils level , namely employment centres and enterprises for equal opportunity .  
The Government , in cooperation with the private sector , had also sought to provide shelter and rehabilitative services to girls who had been sexually abused , and a national plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children was being developed .  
If world commodity markets are left to the &amp; lt ; free play of market forces = , while much high-cost agriculture in developed countries - - even after the Uruguay Round - - continues to be subsidized , the underlying problem of the downward trend in real prices of commodities exported by developing countries is likely to persist .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Their activities were legitimate , competitive and regulated ; they were not dissimilar from those of developed countries that encouraged foreign direct investment .  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
While developed countries had remained relatively unscathed by the recent financial crisis , in developing countries the gains of decades of economic and social progress had been erased overnight and millions had been thrown back into poverty .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
The Dominican Republic is convinced that reform of the Security Council must be carried out in keeping with the principles of equitable geographical distribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States , since no reform will be acceptable if it leads to discriminatory treatment of developing nations by developed nations .  
I call upon every Member State , large and small , developed and developing , rich and poor , to work cooperatively to find meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this growing international problem and challenge .  
As a result , Bahrain has been able to build an open and developed economy that has made it possible for the country to realize comprehensive and sustainable human development , as reflected in its remarkable ranking in the human development index for five consecutive years .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
However , we can not fail to point out that this benefit will not come to everyone equally ; nor can we accept passively the idea that the great majority of people in underdeveloped countries are doomed by massive , dire poverty , hunger , poor health and malnutrition not to be a part of these optimistic statistics but , rather , to be included in the morbidity and mortality statistics characteristic of the less developed regions of the world .  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
In that connection , the situation of the African continent is alarming : nearly two thirds of the least developed countries are located there ; approximately half of its population lives below the threshold of absolute poverty ; and its social indicators are among the lowest in the world .  
In addition , the enormous force of globalization , driven by the advancement of science and technology , instead of serving to unify humankind in a determined and conscious assault against the persistent and systemic problems of our time , is continuously being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak , and is thereby widening the gap between the developed and the developing worlds .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
In this decade the international legal order has been further developed , a number of new States have emerged , the new role and growing strength of the regional organizations has been confirmed , and strong emphasis has been placed on human rights .  
Once again , we call for developing countries to be able to participate on an equal footing with developed countries in the codification and gradual development of international law as an essential premise for establishing a just and equitable international legal order in the next century.The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m .  
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
Indeed , it is in the best interest of the process that the procedural issues pertaining to the meetings be carried out in a swift and prudent manner to allow the actual meeting period to be dedicated to more substantive work.We further support the notion reflected in the draft resolution that , with regard to the appointment of the co-chairpersons , there needs to be representation from both developed and developing countries .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
We are aware , however , that the full potential of confidence-building can be developed only in conjunction with further political steps that require the steady , persistent and sometimes painstaking effort of the international community .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
Having recognized the value of open economies , we should , however , be ready to address emerging population problems such as increasing migration including transit migration , outflow of the most productive young strata of society from the less developed economies to the more prosperous ones , drug trafficking and the spread of AIDS and other dangerous diseases , to name but a few .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
Qatar , which is aware of the international communitys important role in helping small island developing States and other developing countries achieve social development , hopes that the States of the developed world will play their proper role in supporting the economies of developing countries and in reducing the consequences of globalization on our fragile economies .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
The importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes is reaffirmed .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
To be sure , global conventional energy resources are adequate to meet the projected growth in energy services for decades to come , provided that technology is developed to exploit and utilize these resources in an efficient manner ; the total energy resource base is expected to be expanded by the development and application of renewable sources .  
Policies for rural development and rural energy policies should be developed and implemented in a mutually reinforcing way and appropriate government agencies within the responsible ministry for national energy policy should be assigned specific duty for rural energy , in some cases at the local or provincial levels .  
The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties . 
Thus , to be relevant for least developed country identification , an index of vulnerability needs to be concerned with economic vulnerability resulting essentially from structural factors , and to reflect the main kinds of exogenous shocks faced by low-income countries and their exposure to these shocks .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
As explained above ( para . 131 ) , the application of the agreed set of criteria for the designation of least developed countries goes beyond statistical calculations particularly in otherwise marginal cases to the careful assessment both of the numerical results and of supplementary information to be collected , especially a set of vulnerability profiles .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
It reviewed the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of key interventions for adolescent health , highlighted the essential factors and strategies needed to establish , implement and sustain programmes for adolescent health , developed a common framework for country programming and recommended priority actions to accelerate and strengthen programming for adolescent health , including the global and regional support needed for country-level programming . 
Also reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
In short , the draft convention merely serves to protect the interests of developed countries , such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America , which have long _ standing international maritime traditions or a large merchant marine fleet and , consequently , wish to protect their ships from the calamity of arrest , which would prevent them from operating .  
HIC regional networks and committees organized their own Habitat II processes to contribute to the Conference ; the myriad of activities , projects , meetings , publications and other contributions of these civil society processes developed , managed and promoted by HIC and its members could not be listed within this brief space , which notes only some direct HIC contributions to the official process .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
Modelling is most advanced in the field of global warming and climate change , and those models are gradually being developed and linked to other models to take account of demographic trends , land use changes , economic development projections and freshwater supplies , as well as atmospheric and oceanic factors .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
Further standards are likely to be elaborated and mechanisms established at the international level , especially to ensure that genetic research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human rights and dignity , particularly of vulnerable groups of people . 
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
This tragic event was only the forerunner to a series of catastrophic explosions which continued into 1998 and which have destroyed or made inaccessible most of the formerly developed and densely populated southern part of the island .  
Since the sixth session of the Commission , a functioning prototype of the system has been developed , consisting of a revised international site and a demonstration national node , and mock-ups of regional and institutional nodes .  
The Act was accompanied by a decree _ law establishing local boards ( 324 nationwide ) to administer the guaranteed minimum wage ; they are a key element in what is an example of good governance on poverty in the developed world , grounded in the reinforcement of the local mutual aid network by linking official administrators with community organizations .  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
Those materials included international human rights instruments , memorandum and election reports issued by the Special Representative , relevant domestic laws , training curricula , and free and fair elections posters developed by the office .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Access to the markets of developed countries , the reduction in the external debt of heavily indebted developing countries , together with an increase in ODA , should be the key elements of any credible international policy designed to find a lasting solution to the problem of financing for development .  
Furthermore , previous United Nations conferences had developed social rather than development agendas ; there could be no development agenda without full consideration of financial , monetary and trade issues at the national , international and systemic levels .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Recognizing that while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty by the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with long-term perspectives ,  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;

In selecting the priority themes to be addressed at the high-level event , it was important to choose areas where greater understanding of the complex issues of development financing might be achieved ; where solid results might be attained ; where the impact of the measures taken could be maximized ; and where special emphasis could be given to the specific problems faced by the least developed countries .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The reality shows that the globalization process , based on the international economic relations favourable only for the developed countries , is aggravating poverty in the developing countries and widening disparities between the rich and the poor countries .  
For relevant least developed countries in particular , including small island developing States , this may represent a considerable expenditure in the short term , while having a bearing on the future mapping of the natural resources of the continental shelf .  
We consider it of prime importance that the renewed Council be a representative and balanced organ through the inclusion of new members , from industrially developed countries and influential developing States alike , pursuing independent foreign policies .  
Science and technology are advancing with each passing day , productive forces have developed to an unprecedented high level and the search for social progress and the development of civilization have become irresistible historical trends .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
Many developing countries have also lifted controls on interest rates , reduced governmentdirected credit , developed new instruments for longterm investment financing and built a more effective regulatory and supervisory structure for the financial sector .  
The phenomenal technological advances of the twentieth century had brought about strong industrial growth in the developed world but had left the developing countries far behind .

The principles of gradual liberalization in the developing countries , and of differentiated and special treatment of the least developed countries , must be recognized and become an integral element in future trade negotiations .  
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Some have forged ahead and developed integrated , multisectoral approaches to sustainable development which necessitated the establishment of national focal points or coordinating bodies for the implementation of the outcomes of global conferences / summits .  
Ad hoc regimes , acting under the pretext of nonproliferation , continued to pursue discriminatory policies with the main objective of exclusive possession of nuclear technology by developed countries .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
For example , it has developed Unesis , a massive , authoritative , online compilation of United Nations and specialized agencies statistics in the economic , social , financial and general development areas ;  
While the quality of the BtoC relationship is crucial , it is unattainable without a fully developed BtoB network as only through this can the online player offer a complete , complex and competitive product .  
Fourthly , official development assistance targets must be fulfilled , with special attention to the least developed countries and to effective implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative aimed at ensuring increased resources for social development .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
APFIC reported that the issues concerning illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU ) fishing were widely recognized and were ongoing in the APFIC area , by both developed and developing fishing nations .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .

It had pointed to empirical evidence showing that the gap was growing between the developed and developing countries in the wake of globalization , and concluded that the prime objective should be to make globalization beneficial for all countries and peoples .  
Endorse the core set of indicators thus developed as a valuable starting point for countries that may wish to organize and elaborate their own national programmes for the testing , development and use of national level indicators of sustainable development ;  
Aware that individual action can not suffice in this field , Tunisia has developed a close and fruitful cooperation with other States at the regional and bilateral levels , based on a continuing exchange of expertise and information with our partners .  
Although the least developed countries had launched comprehensive economic and social reform programmes , their socioeconomic decline had continued and the gap between the level of their financial resources and their everincreasing needs was widening .  
Liberalization is not possible in LDCs since indigenous human and technological capacities have to be developed first , supported by the gradual removal of protectionist measures and progressive application of international standards .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .

Invites the Bureau of the preparatory committee to play an active and important role in the intergovernmental preparations for the World Summit and to mobilize political support at the highest possible level in both developed and developing countries while pursuing the support of all heads of international organizations within the United Nations system and of international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility and to actively support the role of the Committee in monitoring with a view to considering the reports of all relevant intergovernmental processes .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
If new , more flexible contractual arrangements were to be developed so as to respond to the changing requirements of employing organizations , they would need to be within an overall , standard framework that ensured the continued existence and viability of the international civil service .

It must , however , not be forgotten that migrants are people and that , as such , they have abilities , strengths and potential that need to be enhanced and developed on the basis of respect for their cultural identity , their religious beliefs and all the ways in which they express themselves as human beings and persons wishing to live in dignity .  
Large-scale interregional projects are currently being implemented on the initiative of and with direct participation by Turkmenistan in the energy , transport and communication sectors with a view to giving impetus to the accelerated economic development of the countries of the region and narrowing the technology gap between developed and developing and industrial and agrarian States .  
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
Enhance the capacity of developing countries , particularly least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and countries with economies in transition , to analyse the challenges posed by the ongoing processes of liberalization and globalization and the increasing integration of those countries into the global economic system and to formulate appropriate national policies accordingly ;  
It was held pursuant to paragraph 134 of the Bangkok Plan of Action , adopted by UNCTAD X , and its major objective was to identify , on a country-specific basis , challenges and concerns confronting least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) in the face of the reform process in agriculture and to contribute to the formulation of negotiating proposals by LDCs and NFIDCs in the ongoing World Trade Organization ( WTO ) negotiations on agriculture , so as to ensure that those negotiations would effectively address their concerns .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
This rising trend , which had developed in such a short period , is indicative of the size of the resources discovered , which in addition are considered to be of very high quality .  
These meetings must in particular consider the concepts of operation , which may bear the stamp of concepts developed by military alliances proposing deployments and tasks that can be carried out by relatively small numbers of troops only if , as their national or alliance strategic doctrines also require , they have limitless mobility , seamless cooperation between units , interoperability of the most modern equipment and a range of force multipliers in close support .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
The Principles were developed with the express purpose of filling a gap : to meet the urgent need for a single document which restates existing international law pertaining to the rights of internally displaced persons and the obligations of Governments and insurgent groups towards these populations , and which provides practical guidance for the work of the Representative , international agencies and organizations and NGOs in the field .  
Japan fully supported the language in the draft resolution taken from the Millennium Declaration ( A / RES / 55 / 2 ) and the outcome document adopted at the end of the World Summit for Social Development and Beyond : Achieving Social Development for All in a Globalizing World , entitled Further initiatives for social development , but was particularly concerned that the eleventh preambular paragraph of the draft resolution stated that the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries had contributed , inter alia , to deepening poverty .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the least developed countries , said that economic interdependence was a matter of utmost importance for the developing countries , and their interests had to be recognized and reflected in the reform of the international financial system .

The representative of France , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed through extrabudgetary resources .  
In line with the request of the Assembly that the Secretary-General take additional measures to ensure that the representatives of least developed countries are fully aware and duly informed in a timely manner of their entitlements to travel to sessions of the Assembly , the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services includes in the note verbale inviting representatives of least developed countries to attend the regular and special sessions of the Assembly an annex regarding their entitlements related to travel .  
The main challenge lies both for developed and developing countries in the development , utilization and dissemination of renewable energy technologies , such as solar , wind , ocean , wave , geothermal , biomass and hydro power , on a scale wide enough to significantly contribute to energy for sustainable development .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Efforts to establish an international enabling environment should be conducted in a spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and taking into account the specific conditions of individual countries , in accordance with the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 .  
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .

To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Special Fund had been established by the Assembly in its resolution 1240 ( XIII ) of 14 October 1958 to provide , inter alia , systematic and sustained assistance in fields essential to the integrated technical , economic and social development of the less developed countries .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .  
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
[ 31 ] Experience shows that farmers both in developed and developing countries are aware of the environmental , occupational and health improvements that organic production can generate [ 32 ] , but their main motivation is still improved income in the short-term , [ 33 ] rather than concern about the environment in the longer term . 
In terms of regular resources from private sector , UNICEF has consolidated a unique network of national committees in industrialized countries ( raising one third of UNICEFs resources ) and has developed alliances with important corporations , foundations and non-governmental organizations .  Those efforts resulted in a net income of US $ 165-million , which combined with the US $ 343-million from Governments and US $ 55 million from other income makes the total of US $ 563-million in core funding for 2001 .  
Stresses the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , and requests the Secretary-General to make detailed recommendations in this regard to the Council within six months of the adoption of this resolution , which should be developed in close consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes ;  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
The UNDP Environment Policy Adviser and the Procurement Adviser have developed basic environmental guidelines , an overview of the key issues involved , sources of detailed and reliable information and generic recommendations on major procurement items for use by the Advisory Committee on Procurement and country offices .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
We request the international community to strongly support poverty eradication , and welcome the ongoing consultations by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication to finance and realize , inter alia , the social policies and programmes of the Habitat Agenda to address challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries , especially the least developed countries , bearing in mind the voluntary nature of the contributions .  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
Below 500-m3 , the situation becomes critical and between 100 and 200-m3 , the situation is considered a severe water shortage . 38 There is also a considerable inequality in consumption of water between developed and developing countries and over-consumption by the wealthy mirrors the under-consumption of the poor . 
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) of 31 January 2001 , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes . 
In addition , the methodology moves away from an expert approach , in which the communication expert produces the communication component of the programme , towards participatory communication planning , where all of the countrys team members ( from government , UNICEF , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations ) are involved in the planning , with beneficial results in terms of sharing and learning skills as well as ownership of the final product , which has in itself important implications for the implementation of the strategic communication plan developed .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
Urges developed country Parties to provide technical and financial assistance , as appropriate , through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative programmes to support the efforts of the Parties in implementing the programmes and measures identified in the annexed framework and to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention ;  
This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
It was noted that the implementation of UR Agreements had not visibly improved their countries market access opportunities largely due to : high trade barriers remaining in the developed country markets ; increasing stringency of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical standards and erosion of preferential tariff margins , be it actual or the threat thereof .  
As the implementation of the UR had not been satisfactory to Moroccos interests , it considered that the trade and support measures adopted by developed countries should be significantly reduced , particularly as agriculture constituted the principal economic activity of a large number of developing countries .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
The representative of Singapore , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said the Expert Meeting had provided a unique opportunity for national experts from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to share their experience and to express their views and concerns in an international forum on the impact of AD / CVD actions .  
[ 27 ] Thus , in the absence of a uniform legal framework , voluntary systems are being developed ( discussed below , paras . 52-62 ) which replicate the functions of the traditional bills of lading and are supported by contractual rules binding on the parties . 
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
While least developed countries should assume ownership of designing and formulating appropriate national policies of their own will and choice so as to create conditions conducive to development , and continue to have the primary responsibility for effective implementation of those policies and measures , the full implementation of the Programme of Action is the shared responsibility of these countries and their development partners .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
It calls for the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative on the basis of mutual agreement and commitment by donors and least developed countries , and recognizes that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and from external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
Development partners committed to supporting the least developed countries in their development of energy resources , including renewable energy , natural gas and other clean energy sources , and to facilitating the transfer of technology for the development of clean energy technologies in accordance with relevant international agreements .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
Given the attention being paid to international norms for products entering trade , it was an important step that development partners committed to providing assistance to least developed countries in developing infrastructure to ensure quality control and conformity to international standards of their products and to avoiding taking unilateral action in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
It was acknowledged that the large investment requirements of least developed countries and the very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources , implied a need for new and additional resources and efforts to increase ODA to least developed countries supportive of national programmes of action , including poverty eradication strategies .  
On their part , the debtor least developed countries will aim at maximizing benefits from debt relief by creating a conducive national framework including fiscal reforms , a budgetary framework , sectoral adjustments , contributing to poverty eradication and faster economic growth , export growth , increased investment , enhanced productive capacities , employment and productivity , savings and international competitiveness .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
The national programmes of action identified the difficulties and constraints faced by least developed countries and the required national and international support measures to eradicate poverty , overcome the structural bottlenecks in least developed countries and put these countries on the path of accelerated growth and sustainable development .  
Just prior to the Conference , the Ministers of the least developed countries met in Brussels on 13 May 2001 and adopted a Declaration21 in which they stressed that while the primary responsibility for the development of least developed countries rested with these countries themselves , the amelioration of the worsening social economic conditions in the least developed countries required , among other things , substantial and concrete international support measures . 
The Ministers declared that the success of the Conference would be measured by the nature and extent of action-oriented and operational commitments that would have the greatest impact and significantly contribute to arresting and decisively reversing marginalization , eradicating poverty and thereby improving the social economic conditions in the least developed countries .  
We have the honour to inform you that at two urgent and successive meetings , the first of the Follow-up Committee of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference and the second of the Islamic Group , both held yesterday , at the ambassadorial level , grave concern was expressed over the deteriorating situation that has developed in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem .

The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) , stated that although the economic concerns of the least developed countries had been at the forefront of the development debate for more than three decades , the results were not encouraging .  He observed that the Brussels Declaration provided hope that the next decade would be different from the previous two .  
He stated that LDC-III had provided a good opportunity to review the daunting development crisis in LDCs and that the Conference recognized LDCs critical need for concrete support from the developed countries in terms of resources for development , debt relief , enhanced market access for their products and increased FDI , among other things .  
The panellists hoped that the coordinated monetary stimulus by the major developed countries , as well as the supportive fiscal measures , would lessen the negative impact of the attacks and strengthen economic recovery .  
Regarding the economic situation in Asia one panellist expressed the view that pessimism was exaggerated despite the regions dependence on exports of electronic goods , a still incomplete process of banking and corporate restructuring , and a decline in the stock markets steeper than in most developed countries .  
That had been particularly evident during negotiations on the agenda for the forthcoming World Trade Organization ( WTO ) Ministerial Conference , for , despite high-level pronouncements that trade should promote development , the negotiations had revolved around the need to secure additional benefits for developed countries as a precondition for discussing issues that were critical to the development of most developing countries . 
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
He reaffirmed his countrys full support for the recommendations contained in the outcome documents of the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly , which had enhanced the international communitys awareness of the nature of the social and developmental problems facing the worlds peoples , particularly in developing and least developed countries .

To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .

However , various unfavorable factors are still restricting a continuous and steady economic growth of these countries .  
The most recent annual report of UNCTAD stated that the average annual increase rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the least developed nations from 2000 to 2002 was 4.9 percent ; the average annual increase in the per capita GDP was 2.6 percent , exceeding the 1.8 percent level of average annual increase in the per capita GDP of other developing countries .

For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .

The Chinese side is very pleased with the development , but of the opinion that there is still great potential for the development of bilateral ties , and it takes joint efforts of both sides to continuously expand fields of mutually beneficial cooperation .  
The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
It is precisely because of the implementation of this policy that we have been able to break through the " egalitarianism " that has stifled us for many years , frustrating the people 's enthusiasm , and have been able to fully mobilize and stimulate the great enthusiasm and creativity of workers .  It has greatly liberated and developed productivity , continually raised the masses ' standard of living , and markedly strengthened overall national power .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In recent years , although China 's army computer network has developed fairly quickly , the mutual connectivity between agencies at the regimental level and above has been realized in the majority of units .  However , this situation frequently occurs : As soon as operational training meets with emergency circumstances , computers are abandoned and a return to manual operations ensues , and the more fierce the struggle , the more willing one is to return to " re-operating old-style affairs . "  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
A simulated trainer jointly developed by them for high-speed target tracking by portable missiles has brought about digitized analog simulation for the training on the operational method for striking extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets and has doubled the speed of target tracking .  
If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .  Our army 's equipment development has been carried out in a larger context , ensuring that economic development is the center , and has developed under an increasingly constrained situation .  National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
While vigorously developing agriculture , the DPRK party and government have actively developed the agricultural sideline production and encouraged the people to plant mulberries to raise silkworms and to raise fish and pigs with a view to improving the people 's consumption .  In the meantime , the party and government have launched a nationwide lecture on popular science knowledge to disseminate the knowledge of growing cash crops and breeding animals with economic value .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
they hold that there is nothing wrong so long as the contents of pirated material are neither " yellow " ( pornographic ) nor " black " ( politically questionable } .  If we allow pirating to flourish unchecked , writers will be unwilling to " work " for the pirates , and publishing houses will flinch from an input of several hundred-thousand or several million yuan .  The Commercial Press has developed a CD-ROM of the " Ci Yuan " , but they still do not dare to take it out for fear of piracy .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
The conclusions and requests coming out of the two meetings are diametrically opposed : The resolution of the Group of 77 Ministerial Conference called for changes to the existing irrational economic order , an appeal from the poor countries to the rich ones , while the document drawn up by the G-8 in the meeting in Okinawa involved regulations and requests by the developed countries with regard to the existing world order , and was more like orders issued by the rich countries to the poor ones .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
On the basis of carrying on tradition , the college has updated its concepts according to the new changes in the new stage and eliminated the past curricular theme of cultivating specialized people with uniquely applicable courses.The college has developed a composite education based on universally applicable courses in order to cultivate " versatile people " that can meet the needs of modern wars .  
The main points of dialectic materialism and historic materialism are : The world is material , unified , and interactively linked , and change is developed from low to high , from simple to complex ;  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The evaluation of authoritative figures regarding all this is that the quality of economic growth has improved somewhat , the various relationships are more harmonious , production and consumption have developed together , and macro and micro are increasing in parallel .  
The professors revealed that Harbin Institute of Engineering has all along played a major role in our country 's deep-dive lifesaving research .  Our country 's deep-dive lifeboats are now equipped with a dynamic orientation system developed by the institute .  At present , the institute is still working on a more advanced dynamic orientation system , which could help maintain orientation in various directions with a power device and enable a rescue vessel to quickly link up with a target vessel even when there is rushing current deep in the sea ;  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
The rules of the GATS are extremely advantageous to the developed countries that have superiority in qualified personnel , information , and management , and an excess of educational resources , which have opened up their paths for occupying the commanding height for economic development in the 21st century and winning the battle of contending for talented personnel in the world .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
Over the last 20 years or so , the broad masses of the people have emancipated their minds and acted on an unprecedented historical initiative and proceeded from a highly developed sense of responsibility for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to offer ideas and contribute methods for the reform and opening up and undertakings of modernization drive and actively study new situations and resolve new issues in the light of the actual conditions .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
Meanwhile , the current international situation remains relatively complicated .  While peace and development are the main themes at present , hegemonism and power politics still exist .  The unfair and unreasonable international economic order is still playing its role , and the wealth gap between developing and developed countries keeps widening .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
Since the historic meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and ROK , Kim Chong-il and Kim Tae-chung , held in mid-June in which the " North-South Joint Declaration " was signed , both sides have developed a series of exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , cultural , and other fields , with gratifying progress made .  
how are we going to reform the old international political and economic order that is dominated by a small number of developed western countries and to build a new international political and economic order which is fair and reasonable ;  
In order for command posts to become more efficient in organization and command in field operations , our department has made new trials .  We have designated pilot units for improving command in field operations , explored command equipment , optimized command groups , made command materials , improved command methods , developed command software , and trained command personnel .  This has made command organs combat effective ahead of the military units .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
Fu Quanyou gave a speech after watching the achievement-exchanges in online drill till its finish .  He said , at this crucial juncture when our army 's modernization drive is advancing toward the 21st century , President Jiang Zemin noted with great foresight : " Using computer technology to carry out simulated training is a prominent characteristic of military training in the developed countries .  
Under the order of their commander , officers and men on an array of combat vehicles which are equipped with devices that have been developed and innovated with high technology are successfully blocking attacks launched by precision-guidance weapons against vital targets ; the operational methods they are employing includes " causing confusion by forming a block with scattered laser absorption , causing confusion with simulated intelligence-based infrared rays , causing confusion by misguiding using the positioning system , and creating spoofing confusion with radar evasion " . .  
To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .  
It has been because we have diligently pursued the main theme of development through hard work , exploration , and advancement that we have developed an excellent situation of prominent growth in our comprehensive national capability , marked improvement in people 's lives , and significant increase in our international prestige and influence .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
Liu : First of all , we must ascertain that development is the main theme .  We are faced with the political pressure of international hegemonism , the pressure from the developed countries with their superiority in high technology , and our arduous tasks in China 's modernization drive .  Only by greatly raising our productive forces , can we build a material foundation to solve all kinds of social problems .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
The whole military and armed police forces have meticulously been carrying out and implementing Chairman Jiang 's " five-sentence " general requirement , and grassroots construction has been consistently strengthened and developed in a healthy manner of comprehensive progress and overall improvement .  From this implementation and construction have emerged a large number of advanced examples with outstanding achievements and moving deeds .  
It has been proved through practice that the military school activities for young people developed in elementary schools and junior middle schools and the military training activities developed in high schools and universities are effective means for conducting national defense education for the youngsters ; therefore , the activities have won common recognition from the students , parents , schools , and society .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with concrete Chinese reality , to give accurate answers to a number of problems : the nature of society and revolution in China , the revolution 's leading class and its allies , China 's unique revolutionary road , etc .  While pointing the Chinese revolution in the right direction , he also creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
The unit has attached importance to the research of the characteristics of camouflage confrontation in modern warfare , and insisted on an integration of expedient material and advanced apparatus , of concealing the reality and showing the false , and of camouflage and protection maneuvers .  As a result , they have developed with innovation a batch of camouflage equipment applicable in actual combats .  
in order to meet the need of maneuver of heavily equipped mass target under the condition of modern warfare , the unit has developed a group of capable personnel , equipment capable of guarding against infrared rays , and a series of thermal imaging camouflage equipment ;  
Sun Yanling , a farmer at the outskirts of Bengbu City , Anhui , lost her life because she left her treatment of illness to " Falungong . "  According to statistics , obsessed by Li Hongzhi 's warped theories and heretical thinking , more than 1,600 people have died because of suicides or because they refused to be treated by a doctor for their illnesses ; 651 people have developed psychological problems ;  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
It was with the spirit of facing the gap , being unwilling to lag behind , striving to catch up with developed countries , being independent and innovative and consistently assailing scientific heights which is upheld by the majority of scientific and technological workers that enabled us to gain our precious foothold in the extraordinarily fierce high-tech competition .  
But since reform and opening up , under the influence of negative social effects and with the intrusive corrosion of overseas criminal syndicates , some criminal groups engaging in various serious felonious activities are gradually appearing in our country .  Their activities are becoming more and more rampant and the scales bigger and bigger .  Some have developed into criminal organizations with the character of a criminal syndicate .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the PLA training institutions at the postgraduate level built a number of key academies or schools ; developed a batch of key academic disciplines ; and set up a number of key laboratories as well , and this was a major decision made by the Central Military Commission .  
For instance , there were no China-made robots 15 years ago , but China has currently developed a group of industrial robots , service-oriented robots , and special robots which are applied to industrial production , work involving high risks , and other businesses .  For example , robots for wall cleaning , pipeline robots , robot-like engineering machinery , contour spraying robots , assembly robots , micro-driving robots , and automatic pathfinders have been on the market for application .  Important achievements have been made with the technique of underwater autonomous deep diving .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
In recent years , as China has developed into a stronger China with continually enhanced international status , which the United States does not like to see , while strategically maintaining ties and economically occupying the China market , the United States has stubbornly played the human rights card , sowed discord between the masses and the government , and frequently caused trouble , interfering in , blocking , and sabotaging the cause of the Chinese people in following the road they have chosen and continually developing and growing stronger .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
High-quality military professionals need to be cultivated through military training through science and technology , military professionals need to master high-tech armament through this training , the highly efficient personnel quota system needs to be tested and completed through this training , and advanced military theories need to be innovated and developed through this training .  
In light of the numerous conjectures about China 's timetable on joining the WTO , Zhang said : China is ready to make joint efforts with the WTO members to finish the talks at an early date , but it is hard for the Chinese side to predict a specific timeframe for its accession because this does not depend on China alone but on the 140 WTO members , especially on the political desire of some developed countries . 
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
Chi Haotian said that China and Qatar established diplomatic ties in 1988 , and relations between the two countries as well as exchanges between the two countries ' military forces have developed ever since .  Chi Haotian said that he is confident this visit from the premier will take the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Qatar to a new level .

Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .

In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .

After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out that since the launch of reform and opening up , Zhejiang Province has adhered to the guideline of simultaneous development of a variety of ownership systems , with public ownership as the mainstay , and continually readjusted and perfected the ownership structure ; while non-public ownership economy has developed rapidly , state-owned economy has also developed by leaps and bounds , its total assets have greatly increased , and its controlling power over the national economy has been continually strengthened .  
If our basic research is not developed and can not reach the advanced international level , we will lack the strength for sustained scientific and technological progress and economic development , and our goal will be hard to achieve .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , our government energetically pushed ahead with the reform of the endowment , unemployment , and medical insurance systems ; made a special point of safeguarding the basic livelihood of employees laid off from state enterprises and ensuring that the pensions for retired employees of enterprises be paid in full , on time ; and developed the " triple-safeguard system , " i.e . the subsistence guarantee system and unemployment insurance system for employees laid off from state enterprises and the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents .  
Wang Yingfan noted that developed countries should further open their markets to developing countries , meet at the earliest possible date the target of raising their official development aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product , and fully and effectively solve the foreign-debt problem of developing countries .  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
It should be soberly noted , however , that ours is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion , a weak economic foundation , and uneven regional economic development , that our per capita output value is not high , and that the gap between our country and developed countries remains very wide .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , under the guidance of the party 's agricultural and rural policies , tremendous changes have taken place in the appearance of China 's rural areas , the rural economy has developed in a comprehensive way , peasants ' income has been notably increased , and stability has been maintained in rural society .  
The coming five to 10 years are a vital period for China to attain economic and social development , an important period to perfect its socialist market economic structure and further open to the outside world , and also a crucial period for catching up with the developed countries in science and technology as well as international competition .  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .

On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
I hope the vast number of companies involved in every link of modern logistics , including procurement , manufacturing , storage , transportation , consignment , delivery , and marketing , would seize the good opportunity to learn from the advanced experience of developed countries in developing modern logistics , integrate the experience with China 's reality , work hard to explore , push forward the integration of modern logistics and E-Commerce in China , and raise the level of China 's modern logistics as quickly as possible .

Faced with such a severe challenge , the call from international society demanding a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been heightened daily .  Through arduous negotiations , the 1997 Tokyo Protocol stipulated that developed countries must take the lead in shouldering the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions reduction .

While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .

Long Yongtu said : The increasing flow of foreign capital into China is neither based on the condition of decreasing the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries , nor will it have a significant impact on the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries .  Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .  
It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .

The folk dance is naturally generated and developed from people 's religious and daily life .  It tends to be emotional and expressive , showing the joy and ecstasy of people .  
DH today confirmed one more local case of dengue fever involving a 60-year-old male resident of Ma Wan who developed fever , headache , bone pain and rash in mid-August . He did not require hospitalisation and had recovered .  
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
The Los Angeles News described the show " an artful weaving of myth , ritual , traditional storytelling technique and the orchestral tradition . "  Among the music performed , Japanese Gagaku is the oldest , living orchestral music in existence today .  It began over 1000 years ago as part of the intense cross pollination of the Far East including influences from China , Korea , Persia , Japan and India . The elements of theatre dance and music then settled and were developed into the art form known as Gagaku , music of the Imperial Courts .  
In addition to the technical perfection and natural musicality of the members , the Trio has developed an unmistakable style of their own , a unique combination of traditional romantic virtuosity and classical authentic musicianship .  
The group plays a unique brand of fascinating yet accessible jazz , inspired by the rhythmic complexity and melodic depth of North Indian Raga . With the help of tabla master Zakir Hussain , George Brooks uniquely blended Jazz and Indian Raga , two of the world 's richest and most highly developed improvised art forms , and excitingly added a tabla flavour to jazz music .

In the Chinese history , the Qin and Han dynasties were crucial eras which marked the emergence of China 's basic territorial boundaries , the establishment of the first government of central administration and a unified empire , the expansion of communications with the West , and the development of production technologies .  In the 2,200 years from the establishment of governance systems in those two dynasties to the period immediately before the Revolution of 1911 , China developed steadily on a set trail politically , socially , economically and culturally .  
" Given proper conservation and creative use , the Site has great potential to be developed into a heritage tourism attraction that would enable local residents and overseas visitors to appreciate the unique cultural heritage of Hong Kong . "  
The Report went on to say that during the same period , the source of the disease had been discovered , the virus identified , a quick diagnostic test developed , treatment methods established , temperature checks at ports , airports and border crossing points introduced , those people who had been in " close contact " with SARS quarantined , and efforts stepped up in the community to improve cleanliness and hygiene .  
Through the hard working of its well organized staff , RSEA has developed from a modest beginning handling simple manpower jobs into the present-day broad scope technical construction operation ; from using a few , crude machines to 4 , 740 pieces of modern equipment . RSEA has been rendering its services both on the domes tic services and in several foreign countries .  
The Wide Field of Plastics With active assistance of the government and continued efforts of businessmen , the plastics industry in Taiwan , though starting late , has developed very rapidly . Beginning with processing imported raw materials into daily necessities , then expanding to the current export of self-produced raw materials , its development has been beyond expectation . Plastics have become an important key to the economic development of the Republic of China .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
At the meeting , foreign guests discovered that the quality of Taiwan 's medicine had improved rapidly over the past 30 years . The death rate has declined and the average life expectancy has increased . This period has seen the eradication of most acute infectious diseases . Medical techniques and knowledge have advanced to such a degree that Taiwan may be considered equal to developed countries .  
Surrounded by mountains , the original beauty of its well-planted trees , butterflies , singing birds , wildlife , and lush vegetation , has been preserved by its remote location and its relatively unknown state . Recently , however , the roads to this area have been developed and its fame has spread .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
The buildings were once commonplace in all the surrounding towns , but as those other places developed , while Ts-hsi went through years of slower progress due to a change in its economy , the buildings were torn down in the neighboring towns , and preserved in Ta-hsi , which makes the remaining . buildings in Ta-hsi even more precious .  
Chairman Li of the Sanfeng Company relates an experience of nine years ago when he received an order for a type of rocking chair which was then popular in Europe and America . Lacking the facilities used abroad to press the curved birch for the rocker , Sanfeng developed a method of achieving a more solid curved form with layered wood , which could be conveniently disassembled and transported .  
In light of the recent outcry against the counterfeit industry in the Republic of China , there are several verified facts that have not been properly addressed . According to international trade reports the leaders among counterfeiters in developing nations is Morocco , while among the developed nations , Japan and Italy were the leading offenders .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
During the aesthetically inclined Six Dynasties period ( 222-589 ) , ju-i 's were elaborately carved and engraved from gold , jade , bone , rhinoceros horn , and red sandalwood . They gradually developed into purely nominal good-luck pieces , to be given as gifts or simply admired as objects d'art .  
Looking at this list it is obvious that the foreign tourists ' knowledge of scenic spots relies on outdated information , and that recently developed scenic areas , such as the northern and eastern coasts and Orchid Island have not been sufficiently promoted abroad . This , in the end , is a great loss for the tourists themselves . "  
Some people have called it " a silvery exclamation mark . " Living in the swift currents and rocky beds of torrential mountain streams , the ku fish has developed agile movements and superb swimming skills .  
Since we are still a middle-income nation , we must continue to develop our economy , yet at the same time , the affect of our dense population and the concentrated development of industry makes environmental questions extremely worthy of attention . Thus , our present policy is for economic growth and environmental protection to be simultaneously planned and considered and to be developed in balance .  
Q : Generally speaking , the characteristics of a developed country include a prosperous society with a high income , a high quality of life , a high level of trained personnel , and high mobility , goals which we are engaged in striving to reach . Mr . Premier , would you please discuss for a moment your individual evaluations and expectations ?  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Within these three goals , these are our efforts in each individual area : In the area of national defense : Following the policy of military modernization , we have built up formidable armed forces , successfully developed sophisticated weaponry according to a predetermined plan , and implemented the policy of using only highly qualified soldiers ; over the past five years , military personnel have been reduced by over 35,000 persons .  
The technology involved in making optical fiber cables is rather developed and can be employed commercially on a mass production basis , but scientists are still hard at work day and night working to create a highly advanced technology for the future . (  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
Overriding individual divergences , the skulls all share the features of rather developed cheekbones , flat noses , narrow nasal cavities , sloped foreheads , broad flat faces , and shovel-shaped incisors , all basic Mongoloid characteristics .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
Ms Lin recalls seeing an elderly person tottering round the shop using an umbrella for support , so she hastened over to recommend a safe and reliable walking stick specially developed for the elderly .  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
Of course this is related to our fitting in with Malaysian national policy - - to develop the east coast and to develop agriculture , " says Lin , explaining their " good luck . " Although Malaysia is an agricultural country , it only has palm oil and rubber as relatively well developed cash crops . They rely on imports for most other agricultural products like fruit , rice , and vegetables . Production of aquatic products is also low , so that agriculture has always been one of the sectors with investment incentives .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
Huang says that Stan Lai is super efficient at moving the work along . He constantly revises the plot that developed out of rehearsal from the day before and constantly inspires the actors with fresh interest . He 's adept at encouraging them and giving them hope when they 're stuck .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
It 's a new field , developed only five or six years ago , where we are n't that far behind other countries and where there are wide prospects for future applications . Although some scholars are worried they wo n't fit in with other industries , " high-temperature superconductors do n't require a huge investment , and as long as we keep at it , there 's a good chance we can hold our own with any other country , " Hsu Shiang-kueen says .  
The roots of a big tree : To place its scientific development on a firm footing in the world , Taiwan has to putting down roots in applied science first as a strategic choice . But Li Tai-feng warns that " a country that has become industrially and commercially developed only recently is liable to overemphasize practical applications and neglect basic research . "  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
Inviting trouble : As industry developed and the surrounding environment gradually became polluted , it became nearly impossible to find delicious fresh water fish and shrimp in low-lying areas . Thus the clean , ku-producing upstream portion of the Tsengwen River and its tributary the Tanayiku River became coveted by poachers .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
Taoist doctrine was originally developed from the thinking of the Taoist masters . These masters actually preached passive inaction and following nature , but Taoist doctrine turned this basic naturalism into a different kind of reasoning which affirmed that various " natural " methods , such as alchemy and controlled breathing , could actually resist the limitations of nature and extend life without limitation .  
Before planting 20 million trees : Countries which attach importance to planning prefer to coordinate according to available land resources . For example , when a new residential area was being developed in the Roehampton district of London , it went through detailed planning with the original trees all being kept and protected just as though it were a park . Places such as the special tree-shaded walkway in Berlin , and innumerable other examples , could also be cited .  
Because Ilan is at a low altitude and has many springs , the roots find it easy to quench their thirst and the trees ' crowns grow lush and full . Full of springs and developed by man relatively late , the areas where the mountains meet the plain have most of the remaining banyans .  
According to Cheng , drugs developed in the West tend to be more potent to match the build of the people . Also , Westerners are more prone to cardiac disease , so transdermal patches for treating angina have already been developed . In the Orient , however , liver disease is more prevalent , so there is clearly a greater need for transdermal patches designed to treat liver ailments .  
Later this developed into a fashion , the beads ' simple form became more complex , and they were officially defined as an accessory to court dress . Thus " court beads " were born , as an item of dress peculiar to the Ching court .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Also , because it is cut off from the rest of Taiwan by mountains that run right down to the coast , the east developed relatively late . Many valuable cultural artifacts have thus been preserved up to the present , and there are many archaeological sites from former cultures that settled here .  
The tradition of " eight treasures " Since the Chou Dynasty the Chinese have developed a roster of the " eight most excellent treasures , " dishes which satisfy delicate and exquisite tastes . Favored delicacies have differed from era to era , such as bear paws , swiftlet nests , monkey brains , ape lips and camel humps . Because the number of choice dishes has grown larger and larger , the list has been more precisely divided into four categories of " eight treasures " : mammals , seafood , poultry , and vegetables .  
When the Republican Period began , Tan developed close relations with the Nationalist government , relying on his membership in the early revolutionary society Tung Meng Hui . With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
Over a thirty year period Taipower steadily developed new power plants until by 1986 , it had accumulated a margin reserve of 50% ( well above the normal level of 20% ) . Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
But associate professor Wang Li-chih of National Taiwan University 's forestry department is not worried that introduced rhododendrons will become dominant species and squeeze out other plants . The hybrid rhododendron cultivars , in which particular features are developed for commercial purposes , actually have weaker constitutions than naturally occurring varieties , and rhododendrons generally choose land " abandoned " by other species : on fertile ground , rhododendron can not necessarily compete with other plants in the wild .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
Venice , that romantic city on the water filled with historic architecture , was the wellspring of European capitalism and the Renaissance , and in recent years has developed into an important international exhibition center for movies , music and architecture . The celebrated film festival and this biennial art exhibition are two of the city 's great achievements .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
Tomatoes ca n't stand high temperatures at night and they are vulnerable to bacterial wilt . AVRDC cultivation expert Chen Cheng-tsu , who has developed a number of excellent tomato strains , is untiring in his continued research on this highly nutritious fruit .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
Following the announcement that British researchers working for PPL Therapeutics had cloned a sheep and the marketing of Viagra by the Swedish firm Pfizer , the stock price of Entremed , a previously unknown pharmaceutical firm , recently tripled in one day after it announced that it had developed a new anti-cancer drug . Thought to have high growth potential , biotechnology stocks have become star performers .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
These expensive anti-aging therapies begin with a thorough physical evaluation . In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
Now that athletic sports have developed to the point of maturity and beyond , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) is very interested in promoting " mental sports . " Thanks to the active support of many Western nations , the incomes of chess players have been slowly catching up with the salaries commanded by professional athletes , and chess has even been selected by the IOC for eventual inclusion as an Olympic event .  
If we developed all our hydroelectric resources to their full potential we would be able to generate over 5 gigawatts of electric power . It is our high mountains that bring down the rain and give us our abundant water . Average annual precipitation comes to 90 billion cubic meters , which gives the island a humid climate and luscious greenery .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment . Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . " CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color . As a result of these efforts , however , he later developed cataracts and lost his sight .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
Jade has always been close to the hearts of the Chinese , and while glass was a glittering and translucent material in the West , inspired by precious stones of varying colors , in China it developed primarily as a jade substitute , having a soft , opaque texture .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
The book is filled with conflict between old and new values . As Chu explains : " If we take the status of the ' desolate man ' - a homosexual role-as a metaphor , it hints that if a culture has already developed to the point where people do not want to reproduce , to create a next generation , sex becomes elevated to an end in itself , and the natural drive to reproduce becomes expended in sexual consumption , in pursuit of sensual extremes . . . .  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
The muscles which join their wings to their thoraxes are well developed , and they can beat their front and rear wings separately to control their direction of flight . Most dragonflies can perform the highly difficult maneuvers of flying backwards or straight upwards , and a few of them can even fly across oceans to make long-distance seasonal migrations .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
From the very start , Yung'an has served as an experimental school for the nine-year integrated curriculum . Taiwan 's textbook publishers are now hard at work compiling textbooks for the integrated curriculum , but they have only finished with the first grade so far . The teachers at Yung'an , however , started working long ago to create an integrated curriculum of their own . Using existing textbooks as reference , they have already developed several integrated textbooks for the second and third grades .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
In The Archaeology of Knowledge , French scholar Michel Foucault observes that as medicine has developed from diagnosis by visual inspection , auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests , its information system has been modified ; and how beside the physician there have appeared masses of data , instruments and analytical techniques which of course he uses , but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient .  
Not far from HCG 's plant , in a Coin Chemical Group specialty chemicals plant , after 40 years of hard work researchers have successfully developed a nanotech battery separator , which greatly raises the efficiency of electrolysis in batteries . This has earned Coin entry to a select group of only four companies worldwide that can make this kind of battery separator . Currently , Coin is both keeping the technology a guarded secret and also considering spinning off its nanotech division as a separately listed company .  
Protection of the local industry has become a leitmotif of the communist authorities ' video policy since 2000 . Fostered by the government , TV series have indeed seen rapid progress . Not only have they developed a distinct dramatic style native to China , they have also taken control of the viewership , and the high rate of return on investment is driving the development of the entire TV industry . Stations in every province are forming into groups that are capable of holding their own against the CCTV .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
Yu used to hold down multiple jobs that kept him racing every day between the hospital , television station , radio station , and newspaper . For years he woke up brutally early to do radio and TV shows , stumbling home dead beat well after sundown . He developed a gastrointestinal problem that often left him doubled over in pain without any advance warning .  
In addition , to cope with competition from low-priced imported rice resulting from Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization , beginning in 2002 Wufeng began cooperating with an agricultural research station of the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) to promote the use of Tainong 71 " Yi-chuan fragrant rice . " This variety , developed by Dr . Kuo Yi-chuan , has round and robust grains , and when cooked gives off a special taro fragrance .  
After the SARS warning was issued , people who had been in a SARS area or who had had contact with anyone or anything having to do with SARS , were classified as " suspected " cases if they developed a fever . If they had abnormal chest radiographs ( showing whitish spots indicating the accumulation of white blood cells and body secretions ) they were classified as " probable " cases .  
According to the data , aside from persons suffering from chronic liver , lung and kidney diseases and the old and infirm , those who exhibit the most severe symptoms are adults aged 20 to 50 . Conversely , children whose immune system has not yet fully developed are able to escape this scourge . This provides evidence for the inference that it is the reaction of the immune system and not the SARS virus itself that kills a person .  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
When the salt fields were initially developed , the lagoons and sand bars at Szutsao Lake in Anping were mainly employed . Using basalt and coral rock from Penghu for dikes , the seawater was first channeled into large evaporating ponds . After initial evaporation , the briny water was channeled into small evaporating ponds where it was further concentrated , and the resulting black brine was channeled into crystallization ponds where exposure to the sun yielded crystallized salt .  
After finding the right tool , and keeping in mind that " it 's all a matter of controlling the force , " after countless broken eggs due to squeezing or pushing too hard , Kuan Chun-mai eventually developed his own creative " knife withdrawal technique " whereby an even , well distributed pressure is applied when withdrawing the knife point from the cut . The principle is roughly similar to the " cue withdrawal technique " used in billiards .  
Just because a famous scholar of Taiwan history branded the movement as leftist , people were afraid to even research this period , and the name of Lai Ho , who led the movement and is known as " the father of Taiwanese literature , " was removed from the rolls of those honored at the Martyrs Shrine . This has really been a bum steer when it comes to the direction in which Taiwan 's culture has developed .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Furthermore , Taiwan cuisine went through a period of study , when it was absorbing the advantages of various Chinese regional cuisines , and it created a new kind of cuisine . This represents an even bigger revolution than the one that occurred after the southward migration during the Song dynasty , when the wealthy all moved to Hangzhou and developed " northern cooking with southern ingredients . "  
After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds . I am always looking forward to meeting new friends anytime and anywhere . I have developed a new attitude toward my future life , and my English has surely improved very much .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
In 1994 Wang Tsai-kuei , a National Taichung Teachers College assistant professor and follower of Neo-Confucian scholar Mou Zongsan , developed a simple , easy-to-implement method to teach children classical texts . The idea was that through leading them in recitation in a relaxed , friendly environment , the children could be influenced gradually by the ideas of grace and integrity contained in some of the most valued works of Chinese literature and philosophy .  
With the rise of the Internet and the digitization of audiovisual content , technologies that were originally developed for the two different forms of transmission for video and telecommunications are using digital signal convergence to enable families to enjoy the interactive pleasures of video-on-demand through set-top boxes . Looking at the world as a whole , the spread of digital content is an unmistakable trend .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
Since the 1990s ecotourism has exploded , especially in developing nations in Latin America , Africa and Asia where there are rain forests . These nations have established numerous nature preserves and national parks , and their outstanding natural resources and unique cultures have attracted growing numbers of tourists from the developed world .  
Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty . Since then , Taiwan tilapia has seen its name changed continually , seen selective breeding applied to improve its stock . As the industry has developed , Taiwan tilapia has continued to expand its territory . Of Taiwan 's 52 main rivers , only two have not become part of its domain .  
Since ancient times , people in the East have for the most part believed that the soul does not perish after death . Egyptians developed mummies , and Taoists in China pursued longevity and deathlessness through alchemy . Even the Buddhists , who viewed the human body as a stinking sack of skin , took bodily incorruptibility as a sign of successful cultivation .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach . Can this approach , along with the increasingly successful development of ecotourism , help create a new future for the controversial highland farming industry ?  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches . Having such a major company recognise their work has encouraged Liao and Chang immensely .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
Through international activities , the ACFTU has developed all round friendly relations with trade unions in other countries , strengthened traditional friendship with trade unions in developing nations , resumeed relations with Western trade unions , and improved relations with the three major international trade unions  
Jiang said that since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1986 , their bilateral relations have developed soundly Frequent contacts between senior leaders of the two countries have helped enhance mutual understanding and friendship , and also played an important role in furthering the bilateral ties , he added  
China is satisfied with Sino Uruguayan ties , which have developed smoothly since the two nations established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , he said , adding that he is convinced that Batalla 's current visit would further develop the bilateral ties  
In recent years , China has established a comprehensive social security system for the aged , set up a system to ensure the basic living standard for urban residents , and also developed numerous community service facilities for older people , which have improved older people 's living conditions , Li added  
he added that local border trade with the former soviet union also developed rapidly last year , the province achieved 1-07-billion swiss francs in border trade with the former soviet union , a 48 percent increased over 1990 in addition , the province 's economic and technological cooperation and labor export increased by a big margin  
One of the main endeavours of the least developed countries is to achieve an optimum balance between human needs and the natural resources base in order to maximize their ability to meet these demands on a sustainable basis .  
Deeply concerned about the disturbing situation that has developed over a substantial part of the territory of the former USSR as a result of armed conflicts with national , religious and political causes ,  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
The right to an adequate standard of living is a universally recognized human right and should serve as a basis from which national and international policies are developed .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
It was also stressed that the computerization of criminal justice systems should be applied at the national and international levels , with due consideration given to the standards prevailing in both developed and developing countries .  
Indeed , after a long period of conservative and incremental technical change , alternative process routes for mineral production are being developed and these are emerging as economically more efficient as well as environmentally less hazardous .  
Among the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual life styles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
The objective is to achieve a rapid and substantial reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality , reducing the differences observed between developing and developed countries , and to eliminate all deaths from unsafe abortion .  
UNU , working with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , has developed a master protocol for comparing the effectiveness of a weekly versus a daily iron supplement in anaemic pregnant women , in adolescent girls and in preschool children .  
The MSI research demonstrated that promising entrepreneurs can be identified and trained , and based on the results of this research MSI developed a compact , costeffective , training programme for identifying and developing local sources of entrepreneurship .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
Despite a renewal in economic growth world wide , the number of people living in absolute poverty has increased in developing and developed regions alike .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
Most developing countries had implemented economic reforms on the advice of the developed countries and international financial institutions , but at great social and political cost .  
The cooperation currently being developed at the international level in the political and economic fields could only be effective if accompanies by strengthened international policies and actions in regard to social matters .  
The total stock of external debt in the least developed countries represented nearly three quarters of their combined gross domestic product .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
Revision of the existing system , which would allow , inter alia , for automatic updating of the scale , with permanent members of the Security Council paying a uniform fixed premium on their regular budget contributions , economically less developed countries benefiting from that surcharge in proportion to their per capita income and economically more developed countries paying the same percentage as towards the regular budget ;  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
The concerted efforts of the international community must be directed towards , and must lead to , concrete programmes of action and the consolidation of an effective platform for international cooperation , with the support of the Secretariat and the agencies of the United Nations system , and also those of the developed countries and world or regional financial bodies for international cooperation .  
Since national legislation varies from country to country and , in practice , the borderline between licit and illicit arms transfers may not always be apparent , measures conducive to [ harmonizing ] [ achieving common ] laws and / or regulations and procedures , [ as well as the means of enforcing them , ] should be developed at the international level to ensure effective control over the acquisition and transfer of weapons .  
The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights of national minorities and indigenous peoples and has established a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea . But for Ukraine , which faces conditions of economic crisis and a complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary infrastructure , services and mechanisms , the task of accommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated persons appears too complicated .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
This is what strikes me , as I now appear for the first time before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of a country such as mine a country with a modest economy , a small population , a territory that is medium-sized but which , owing to its excellent geographical situation , developed more than others ; a culture of social freedom , of mixed races and of political independence , achieved by means of an epic struggle , not only for itself but for all of its American neighbours . 
The recent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakarta issued a renewed call for a new orientation between developed and developing countries whereby constructive dialogue and partnership were emphasized , based on a mutuality of interest and benefit , genuine interdependence and shared responsibility .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
However , our conscience can not rest easy in view of a reality that we can not ignore : the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject poverty , and the challenges posed by the enormous gap between the annual per capita gross national product for the least developed countries less than $ 200 and that of advanced industrialized countries , which is more than a-hundred times higher . 
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
Moreover , the selective policies pursued by some developed countries in liberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist policies which are put in place behind a fa \ x { 84f7 } de of environmental , human rights or other considerations , contradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international trade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment of the present imbalances .  We welcome the World Trade Organization as it begins its work .  
In addition , it is necessary to deal with unjust practices in international economic relations such as coercive economic measures , including boycotts , the freezing of assets , the confiscation of property and the prohibition of the export of spare parts , which has been applied by certain developed countries against a number of developing countries , including my own .  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
Nevertheless , we continue to hold the view that unless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the international community , no meaningful progress for the next 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future by the developing countries , especially the least developed among them .  
Our people find it astonishing that in an era of such developed mass communication , which leaves no distance between different corners of the globe , the apparently insurmountable difficulties in particular , the actual causes of the continuing imposed war are not understood .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
Mohammed Bedjaoui , whose name , renown and work are intimately linked with the noble objective of strengthening the rule of law based on justice and equity , has shared with the Assembly his exemplary reflections , which will naturally find their proper place in the plans being developed by Member States with a view to launching the United Nations into the next century with the certainty of a future that is brighter than the tumultuous past 50 years of its existence . 
To this end , an institutional infrastructure was developed to promote economic and social development for our peoples through the establishment of a new international economic order , one that would generate more favourable conditions and opportunities for the developing countries to make progress , thus setting in motion a process of evening out the major imbalances between North and South . 
In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
In our view , a speedy recovery from the critical situation of depleting resources requires , first and foremost , that the developed countries honour their political commitments by increasing substantially their contributions to resources on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , especially their official development assistance . 
Understood as a value which encompasses universal pluralism and a genuine acceptance of cultural diversity , the idea of tolerance represents , first of all , a valuable intellectual and practical framework within which the vitally important norms of a good society and a peaceful world can be developed .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
In the meantime , the European Union strongly appeals to all participating States to spare no effort to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the Review Conference , which will significantly reduce the dangers posed by the indiscriminate use of land-mines and contribute to the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines , as viable and humane alternatives are developed , as the ultimate goal of efforts in this field . 
Intensive , short , practical training programmes with emphasis on skills in effective communication , community organization and facilitation of behaviour change should be developed in order to prepare the local personnel of all sectors involved in social development for carrying out their respective roles .  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .  
UNCTAD , when carrying out technical cooperation , should exploit its comparative advantages , ensure complementarity with the related work of other international organizations , intervene on strategic and catalytic grounds and allow for the differentiated needs of developing countries with a particular focus on the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , in accordance with the Cartegena Commitment .  
However , in order to use the limited resources in an optimal manner to meet these different needs a single comprehensive framework of training materials should be developed through modules that would be applicable to countries depending on their status and capability in national accounts .  
In the developed countries , policy concerns have focused on the health needs of the growing elderly populations and on diseases connected with individual lifestyles and environmental conditions , such as cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancer .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
We should therefore like to stress the importance of advancing in the creation of a true partnership between the less developed and the more developed , at an appropriate pace , as a crucial step in fostering an equitable and peaceful international system at the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
Many of those weapons are being bought , from developed countries , by developing countries that can least afford to dissipate their precious and finite assets for such purposes , and the volume of the trade in light weapons is far more alarming than the monetary cost might lead one to suspect . 
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Establish a group of eminent persons selected through a consultative process and balanced between developed and developing countries , as well as equitably representing all interest groups and the forest products trade , with a mandate to chart a path towards steady progress in international trade in forest products from all types of forests based on sustainably managed forests and the application of criteria and indicators to measure and monitor such management . 
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , and especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development ,  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
As a result of this cooperation , which has a broad base in civil society and non-governmental organizations involved in improving the status of women , the preparatory documents for the Beijing Conference have been prepared and a system developed to establish a national capacity for putting the strategy into operation .  
Recognizing that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action is of particular significance as it will provide an opportunity to the international community to set out new and corrective policies and measures , including strengthened external support to the least developed countries in all areas , to support their efforts so as to ensure the timely , effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade ,  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , [ 3 ] / and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
The chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women , and that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
This was accompanied by a dramatic fourfold increase in developing countries and substantial increase in the former centrally planned economies ( by a factor of 2.4 ) .  7 / In per capita terms , the absolute consumption of fossil fuels in developed countries outstripped by a factor of 9 the consumption level in developing countries , as is evident in table 3 .  
Environmental monitoring data and other relevant information , including consumer information , which are currently lacking in many developing countries , need to be developed urgently so as to provide a sound information base for policy formulation and decision-making on changing the current unsustainable production and consumption patterns .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
The additional post of Economic Affairs Officer requested will be the focal point essential to mobilize the existing expertise and research capabilities required to guide developing countries and least developed countries and strengthen their understanding of these matters and the competitiveness of their enterprises in increasingly globalized world markets and marketing requirements .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Collection and evaluation of information for the development and maintenance of performance indicators ; basic data for least developed countries ; studies , analytical papers and issues notes for technical meetings , including round tables , consultative groups and the Committee on Development Planning , as well as joint publications with regional commissions and other organizations .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
In view of the special importance attached by ECO to the control of drug abuse and illegal trafficking , a comprehensive regional plan has been developed for implementation with the help of concerned international agencies and regional organizations .  
Empowerment in this regard might be perceived as adopting a correct ( technical / organizational ) approach , based on alternative sets of prescriptive rules developed by experts .  
The Canadian costing officer who had led the ad hoc group discussions on the development of major equipment wet and dry lease rates explained the criteria and methodology used .  In achieving fairness , rates had been developed using four factors : generic fair market value of the equipment , the useful life of the item , the potential for loss or damage and , for wet lease arrangements , the costs of maintenance ( consisting of spare parts and repairs ) .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Therefore , as a means of maximizing the potential for such cooperations , triangular funding arrangements buttressed by the active contribution of developed countries and relevant international organizations should be enhanced .  
Indeed , discussion of the issue has never been so extensive : the chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women ; that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate ; and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes should take into account a gender perspective .  
The free and orderly development of financial markets should also be promoted and mechanisms developed to bring about a more stable international financial system which would ensure that increased resources are available to its institutions and that the latter would be capable of detecting , in time , potential exchange-rate and financial crises , which negate the considerable efforts being made by our countries to achieve economic reform , liberalization and stability .  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
The Panel stressed that all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings and expert consultations in support of the work of the Panel should ensure the transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives as well as a balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
Developed country representatives underlined their support for the process through contributions to the two funds : they are both considered important , since it is essential that the high quality of Secretariat work be maintained ; and necessary that developing countries , in particular least developed countries , be well represented at forthcoming sessions of the Committee .  
NULLThe Panel recommended to all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings or expert consultations relevant to the work of the Panel to ensure the open-ended , transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives and the balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
Based on this research , a training programme has been developed to strengthen national and regional capacity for strategic development policy analysis , focusing on tools and techniques that incorporate the local cultural and social context for evaluating the socio-economic driving forces of structural change . 
In the strong belief that concrete , broad strategies must be developed and applied to fight corruption , we reiterate our commitment to adopt cooperation mechanisms to combat that criminal activity because it weakens the democratic system , undermines the prestige of its institutions and constitutes an agent of social disintegration and distortion of the economic system .  
The overriding goal , in this respect , should be to mount a concerted attack on poverty , building on the conceptual framework developed at the Social Summit - in particular the consensus reached in Copenhagen that poverty elimination requires basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods , the advancement of women and an enabling environment , at both the national and international levels .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .  
Despite all the efforts of the international community , particularly the Paris Club and development partners such as France , Germany , Japan , the United States of America , Denmark and Canada , to alleviate the debt burden and cancel part of the bilateral official debt , the least developed countries continued to experience a falling standard of living .  
In order to secure global peace and prosperity , it was essential to close the widening gap between the developed and developing countries and to ensure that development was equitable and sustainable .  
Governments in such regions can do much to remedy intrinsic factors that contribute to that unattractiveness but they will need more help to enable them to meet the financial requirements of sustainable development , for which genuine new and innovative sources will be required , including sources in the developed world .  
There is clearly an inadequate level of implementation of existing conventions and of international rules , regulations and standards , as reflected in the insufficient adaptation of national legislation and procedures , the inefficiency of enforcement and the increasing gap between developed and developing countries in their capacity for implementation .  
It is anticipated that one of the areas to be developed is joint peace-keeping seminars , co-sponsored by national staff colleges and the United Nations , with a view to increasing general knowledge and understanding of peace-keeping for mid-level and senior military and civilian officers .  
Noting also with concern the urgent need to fully address the problem of the combined external debt stock of developing countries , bearing in mind the special and critical situation of the most indebted developing countries in Africa and the least developed countries ,  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
There is danger that , due to scientific / technological backwardness , the Federal Republic may experience a period of " ecologic blockade " after the sanctions are lifted , because its economy will not be ready to meet the demands of the markets of developed countries who are the Republic 's main trade partners .  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change . 
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
In the light of this and against the backdrop of the current climate of budgetary stringency and scarcity of official development assistance , two major policy issues have been identified : ( a ) how to improve aid allocations to the least developed countries ; and ( b ) how to enhance the quality and effectiveness of assistance .  
While the Naples Terms are a welcome step forward , they can have a significant role in providing debt relief only if they are applied to a sizeable part of the total outstanding debt and if the debt stock reduction is extended to a large number of least developed countries .  
Since emissions of pollutants into the environment , including toxic and hazardous wastes , originated primarily in the developed countries , and since the latter 's unsustainable consumption and production patterns continued to be the major causes of the deterioration of the global environment , developed countries should take the main responsibility for protecting the environment .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
By the middle of 1990 , the First Group , with continued foreign assistance , had developed designs and had fabricated and tested a small series of prototype centrifuge machines incorporating carbon fibre rotors and magnetic bearings , the final version of which had a demonstrated capacity of the order of 2 kg separative work units ( SWU ) per year .  
continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Calls upon the international community , particularly developed countries and international organizations , to fulfil all their commitments as affirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular on the effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to enable those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
order to be effective , the operational activities required a continuous , predictable and assured flow of funds especially towards the least developed countries which were in a desperate economic situation .  
this connection , it is understood that the Trust Fund referred to in operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution could be used for payment of a daily subsistence allowance to the aforementioned representative from each least developed country attending the special session , in line with the practice applied under the terms of section XII of Assembly resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , with respect to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Calls upon the international community , particularly developed countries and international organizations , to fulfil all their commitments as affirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular on the effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to enable those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;

concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
order to be effective , the operational activities required a continuous , predictable and assured flow of funds especially towards the least developed countries which were in a desperate economic situation .  
this connection , it is understood that the Trust Fund referred to in operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution could be used for payment of a daily subsistence allowance to the aforementioned representative from each least developed country attending the special session , in line with the practice applied under the terms of section XII of Assembly resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , with respect to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Also invites the international community to make substantial contributions to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and holding of the World Food Summit as well as to facilitate the full and effective participation of representatives of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , both at the preparatory meetings for the Summit to be held in January and September 1996 and at the Summit itself ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Over the years , UNCTAD has become the main forum for North-South debates , and played a crucial role in the establishment of the generalized system of preferences ( GSP ) , a maritime shipping code , and in setting international aid targets to help developing countries , particulary the least developed among them .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
than ever before it was necessary to observe the essence of " partnership " and " interdependence " in international relations with a view to providing substantial support to structural adjustment programmes in the least developed countries on terms adapted to their needs , as well as additional financial assistance to enable them to alleviate poverty , protect the environment and carry out social programmes .  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
The macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programmes of a wide range of least developed countries had not been successful during the first half of the current decade owing to an overall unfavourable external environment .  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
conceptual framework incorporating socio-economic and gender analysis at the macro ( inter-household ) and micro ( intra-household ) level with people 's participation and conflict resolution has been developed and is being operationalized through a socio-economic and gender analysis field manual accompanied by an open-ended series of technical supplements , which will be concise , sector and subsector specific guides to utilizing the socio-economic and gender analysis paradigm .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
The Committee agreed to continue at its sixteenth session , the preparation of general recommendations on article 7 of the Convention on the basis of the working paper prepared at its fifteenth session and an additional text to be prepared and supplied to members in the working languages of the Committee well in advance of the sixteenth session .  The working paper was prepared after reviewing the draft developed at the Committee 's thirteenth session and in the light of developments in the interim .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
The agreements of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 , the rapid redefinition of economic groupings in the developed countries , and the ever more important role of private capital in the world economy , have created a new international environment in which the interests of Africa do not seem to have been taken into account , or in which they are even threatened or compromised . 
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
They should , inter alia , pave the way for the active and global participation of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , in the work and procedures of the United Nations , including the Economic and Social Council , bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these countries in the economic and social challenges facing today 's world .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints faced by various developed countries , clarification of foreign aid objectives , revised conditions governing the granting of assistance , and the heightened competition among various regions for aid packages constitute a serious challenge for developing countries such as mine .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
I am pleased to say that , through decisive action rather than words , we have made genuine strides in enlarging our dialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide , developed and developing alike .  
The changes affecting the international economic scene following the crystallization of the concept of economic globalization and the liberalization of trade-mandate corrective measures require that the existing disproportion be corrected , particularly since the behaviour of certain developed countries in trade liberalization is still marked by a selective approach .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
In this new era of heightened interdependence , a lack of solidarity still characterizes international relations , and self-interest is persistent in terms of both security and development , emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that can effectively narrow the growing gap between developed countries ever more prosperous and stable and a developing world faced with poverty and disorder of every sort .  
It recognizes the efforts of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to incorporate social development into their policies and programmes in a variety of ways and more intensively than in the past , as well as the urgent need for the international community to make efforts to reach as soon as possible the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance .  It also endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 , on new and innovative ideas to generate new funds .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and increase the share of funding for social development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
The UNEP contribution will also include , depending on the availability of funds , establishment of regional expert panels to develop suitable classification systems and to evaluate the accuracy and utility of national , continental and global data sets being developed under land-cover characterization studies .  
Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication , local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed , and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
The Council acknowledged the need to facilitate access for developing countries to energy-efficient technologies and research , and called upon the international community , including developed countries , to make technologies and financial resources available to the developing countries to enable them to fully develop their potential capability in the field of new and renewable sources of energy , including their vast hydropower resources .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
With regard to Tibet , her delegation noted that it had formed an integral part of China since the thirteenth century and that the Tibetan people had assumed control of their country in 1959 , the year in which China had abolished serfdom and introduced democratic reforms in Tibet . In the past 30 years , the country 's economy had developed and the standard of living had risen .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
Commending continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
Due to tight budgets in developed countries , developing countries and economies in transition , policy makers are showing increasing interest in saving on scarce budgetary resources by launching reviews of existing subsidy regimes .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
They reaffirmed their commitment to work cooperatively towards achieving the prime objective of the Programme of Action which is to arrest the further deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least developed countries , to reactivate and accelerate growth and development in these countries and , in the process , to set them on the path of economic growth and sustainable development based on shared responsibility and strengthened partnership .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and in this context , the proposal of the Government of Norway to host a meeting in 1996 among interested countries and representatives of relevant international institutions , with a view to considering how the 20 / 20 initiative can be applied operationally , is welcomed ;

Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
Whatever their geographical scope , however , issues such as depletion of natural resources , declining food production , and declining availability and quality of water were linked with issues such as income generation , literacy , health care , unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the developed world , privatization and the effects of structural adjustment programmes , international trade patterns , and the foreign debt burden .  
Israel , however , reported that the Landau Commission for the Inquiry into the Investigation Techniques of the General Security Services ( GSS ) concluded that if a public emergency developed , or whenever an imminent threat to national security was at hand , GSS investigators would be able to use " moderate physical pressure " to gain important information from those who knowingly endangered public safety .

Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .

In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
Interested developed and developing country partners should reflect their mutual commitment by allocating , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance , including contributions through multilateral organizations and non-governmental organizations and 20 per cent of the national budgets ( net of aid ) , respectively , to basic social services , as soon as possible and preferably by the year 2000 .

The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
The difficulty experienced by international organizations and Governments to update their respective instruments was recognized , but it was recalled that the Recommendations have been developed and are kept up to date in the light of technical progress , the advent of new substances and articles and the exigencies of modern transport systems , and therefore there would be a risk for the Recommendations to become obsolete or not adapted to the technical progress if a four-year interval period was adopted .  
ESCAP and ECLAC have agreed to cooperate in an interregional project , developed by UNCTAD and funded by UNDP , in which the two commissions will undertake studies on the prospects and potential for mutual trade and investment cooperation among their concerned members which will provide the basis for a ministerial meeting of those countries , to be organized by UNCTAD . 
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
The Group considered that the exploration plan as developed in its report would be completed at the same time that mining and processing technology were tested and considered appropriate , adequate mine sites identified , the market environment proved attractive for investment , and when a decision to proceed to a feasibility study would have to be taken . 
As to the specific proposal raised by Malta ( see A / 50 / 142 ) , the question of how the United Nations machinery for dealing with international environmental issues should be developed is a very important substantive issue that needs to be addressed in the first instance by the policy machinery that the General Assembly has set up to consider coordination of environmental and development issues - the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
Considerable international technical and financial assistance is provided by the housing cooperative movement in developed countries ; for example , for 44 years , the United States Cooperative Housing Foundation has supported projects in 90 countries , and is currently active in 30 , including major projects in South Africa and Poland . CECODHAS and ICA Housing work energetically in support of housing cooperatives in the transitional economies . 
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
By its resolutions 44 / 215 , 46 / 210 , 48 / 168 and 50 / 96 , the General Assembly urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .

With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
Cuba considers that the considerable problems with anti-personnel mines experienced by a number of third world countries are due in large part , if we limit ourselves to the most direct causes , to the unscrupulous export policies which have been extensively practised by several developed countries ; these have made substantial profits from such operations and taken little account of the impact on the civilian populations of many countries .  
In its resolution 50 / 203 , the General Assembly reaffirmed that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , would also be required . 
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .

In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
As follow-up to the Summit , the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) planned two workshops to be held in 1996 ; the first , on managing the social consequences of structural change in transition economies ( Paris , 1 and 2 July 1996 ) , provided a forum for joint reflection and exchange of experiences between experts and senior officials in charge of economic and social policies in both transition and developed market economies .  
In its resolution 50 / 161 , the General Assembly reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
The Ministers emphasized the need for information and communication strategies to be rooted in deep historical and cultural processes , and urged that the views , models and perspectives of the media of developed countries not be allowed to determine to an undue extent the style and orientation of media policies in developing countries .  
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
Because the United Nations system plays a predominantly supporting and facilitating role in shelter and settlements development , the substantive content of the follow-up by the United Nations system to Habitat II will be guided by national and local priorities for assistance , as outlined in the national reports and as further developed by the national mechanisms recommended in the Habitat Agenda .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
The Special Fund had been established by the Assembly in its resolution 1240 ( XIII ) of 14 October 1958 to provide , inter alia , " systematic and sustained assistance in fields essential to the integrated technical , economic and social development of the less developed countries " .  
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
Under the theme of governance , UNIFEM is continuing to build on its three-pronged strategy to ( a ) create an enabling environment where the legal and social status of women is improved , and more gender-sensitive policies and plans are not only developed but also implemented ; ( b ) strengthen the women 's movement so that it is able to create an enabling environment and effect social change ; and ( c ) promote women 's enhanced leadership and participation .

In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
The collective goal of the former colonial Powers was to continue controlling the former colonies in order to guarantee a continuous flow of inexpensive raw materials and cheap labour while at the same time ensuring a stable market for goods from the industrially developed countries .  
Convinced that political rights can not be developed or preserved unless basic minimum economic and social rights are realized , since 7 November 1987 - the date on which President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali acceded to the Supreme Magistrature - Tunisia has worked continuously to promote and protect the full range of political , economic and social rights .  
Tunisia 's health system has developed a policy based on primary health care , which is itself focused on mother and child care , family planning , school and university medicine , prevention of epidemic diseases , and campaigns against certain social ills , as well as on treatment of everyday illnesses and dispensing of basic medicines .  
In addition , comprehensive media support , based on permanent cooperation with the mass media ( national radio and television services , regional radio services , press ) has been developed and gradually strengthened by :  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation also expressed the urgent need for the international community to call upon certain developed countries immediately to eliminate laws and regulations with adverse extra-territorial impacts and other forms of coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
The overall objective , strengthening civil society , is pursued on a country-by-country , regional , interregional and global basis , through the provision of assistance to national non-governmental organizations in the form of training courses on human rights , fellowships and support of appropriate projects developed by them .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
Now that the countries of the Rio Group had implemented the adjustments and modernizations required for their social and economic development , and in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation and the International Development Strategy , it was to be hoped that the developed countries would also assume their responsibility to create a favourable international environment for cooperation and economic development , especially with regard to the developing countries .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
Expressing her delegation 's strong interest in pursuing durable solutions , she cited the innovative and comprehensive approaches developed by UNHCR for addressing population movements and said that voluntary repatriation should combine the elements of sustainable development , a community-based approach and a focus on returnee communities .  
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction the close and effective cooperation developed with United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and other competent bodies , including non-governmental organizations , to foster international solidarity with a view to promoting the realization of children 's rights , in particular in the light of articles 4 and 45 of the Convention . 
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
Moreover , the willingness and psychological capacity of the developed countries to provide asylum and support were diminishing ; that had been reflected in decreased aid and an increase in restrictive practices that circumscribed the right of asylum , particularly if persons happened to be from different ethnic or cultural backgrounds . 
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
It is a matter first and foremost of the lives and well-being of millions of innocent people who depend on this carrier to avert the dangers of deadly and lethal diseases in a country that is classified as among the least developed countries whose limited possibilities and scarce resources , as mentioned , are well known to you .  Accept , Sir , the assurances of my highest consideration .  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
The President of Mongolia , in his address to the General Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , had emphasized the importance of developing a set of ground rules for the pacific settlement of disputes , an idea further developed by Mongolia 's Prime Minister in his recent address to the General Assembly when he had called on the international community to elaborate the guiding principles for conducting international negotiations .  
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered . 
Reports should also indicate the activities and programmes developed , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the target groups identified , including by age , gender and national , social and ethnic origin , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities established , and the consideration given to the aims of education as identified by article 29 of the Convention , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered .

Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Finally , once the target has been identified , a plan of action needs to be developed to meet the objective ; section III thus gives an integrated presentation of ISWGNA work programmes , highlighting recent achievements and reviewing proposed priority areas for future work in the light of expressed country needs .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
Noting that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
A single , integrated international database containing extensive basic statistics and indicators covering a wide range of topics in these fields is being developed for wide dissemination pending the provision of extrabudgetary support .  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Reaffirms also the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ; 
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular , to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
All available tools - trade , investment and structural adjustment - must be brought to bear on the problem of the marginalization of least developed countries , and there must be close cooperation between WTO , various organs of the United Nations system , the Bretton Woods organizations , and the various regional bodies to ensure that the resources and expertise of the international community remained focused , coordinated and relevant to the most pressing global needs . 
Commenting on the need to assist many developing countries , especially the least developed countries , with the promotion of exports , he said the EU had taken note of the suggestion in the Trade and Development Report 1996 for establishing an international marketing and information service , but was of the view that such assistance should take place at a level as close as possible to the relevant industry and be based upon detailed understanding of export capabilities .  
The representative of Australia complimented the secretariat on its analysis of factors contributing to dynamic growth in East Asia and noted that the Trade and Development Report 1996 pointed to the important role in the growth of economies in the region played by the rapid expansion of exports of labour _ intensive manufactures to major developed countries . 
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;

Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;

Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .  
For the appropriate management of high seas fisheries as well as that of the exclusive economic zones , the developed countries should transfer the necessary technology to developing countries to enable them better to conduct scientific research , handle data and pursue fisheries operations in a more responsible manner .  We now face the formidable task of implementing the comprehensive global framework of ocean management .  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Mechanisms should continue to be developed within the United Nations to give the nominated representatives of indigenous organizations and peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice and take part in decision-making in the search for solutions to the problems faced by their peoples .  At its fifty _ second session , the Commission , by decision 1996 / 102 , established an agenda item entitled Indigenous issues .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
In fact , we are aware and convinced that merely meeting the requirements of the ritual of holding periodic elections is not enough and can in no way be considered decisive in establishing and guaranteeing lasting democracy in a country , particularly in a developing country such as my own , which is classified among the least developed .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Nevertheless , there is now a strong signal to developed countries to commit at the upcoming Kyoto meeting on climate change to legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for greenhouse gas emissions .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Strengthened international cooperation and the application of appropriate national policy will also contribute to ensuring a stable environment conducive to promoting social development , including reduction of unemployment and generation of productive employment in developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
At its third session , held in Argentina in November 1996 , the Conference of Parties to the Convention decided on a future programme of work for terrestrial biological diversity , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Convention secretariat to develop , in consultation and with the assistance of the Panel , or any successor arrangement , a focused work programme on forest biodiversity that would place an emphasis on research .  FAO has a forest genetic resources programme that has been developed over the past three decades .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
A partnership for development should be forged in which developed and developing countries would undertake , in a framework of growing interdependence and joint responsibility , to establish sensible national policies and an international climate conducive to sustainable and accelerated development .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
In the fourth review and appraisal , representatives of non-governmental organizations have been included in 31 ( 72 per cent ) of the national coordinating mechanisms : 48 per cent in developed countries , and 62 per cent in developing countries , a slightly higher level than that reported in 1992 .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
An international collaborative research initiative , PLEC is based on a comparative network of locally based research clusters ; five are now operational in West Africa , East Africa , Montane Mainland South-East Asia , Papua New Guinea and Amazonia , and a sixth is being developed in the Caribbean region .  
In this regard , the promulgation of strict legislation to control transboundary movements of dangerous wastes should be continued and , in particular , encouraged in the developing countries in order to reduce the discrepancies between the national legal norms applied in the developed and the developing countries .  
Also with regard to the United States , the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her particular appreciation of the comprehensive training module developed since 1982 by the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , which is responsible for carrying out law enforcement training programmes on juvenile delinquency .  Since 1983 , training programmes on child abuse and sexual exploitation investigative techniques for local law enforcement officials have also been held nationwide .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Harnessing the positive potential of development and trade is also being developed in other key areas of the Convention , such as access to genetic resources ; intellectual property rights ; technology transfer ; and social and economic incentives .  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Its strategy was based on a number of measures , which were summarized as legislative provisions in the areas of proceeds of crime , improvement of law enforcement capabilities , relying on the assistance and expertise of other countries that had already experienced organized crime problems and had developed methods to prevent and control it , better coordination among the relevant national authorities and improved international cooperation .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
To this end , the resident representatives worked in partnership throughout 1996 with all relevant headquarters units , particularly with ( a ) the regional bureaux , which provided the supporting management framework , advice , training and , together with the Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) , assistance in matching core competencies with country office needs and ( b ) the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support ( BPPS ) , which supplied analytical tools , developed in consultation with country offices , global studies and methodological guidance .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
The international community and international organizations were requested to support national initiatives and implementation of the targets set in the Platform for Action , including the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Even though there was no specific mention to this effect in the response received from the Netherlands , it is known that the country , along with other developed countries , such as Japan , participates in triangular arrangements , whereby the services of suitable developing countries are utilized to deliver a technical cooperation input to another developing country .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the least developed and landlocked developing countries have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and other international declarations .  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Governments are needed to create the conditions that will allow consistent and realistic goals to be developed and met goals that are based on good science and the sound assessment of risk , and which balance ecological , economic and social objectives .  
The most complex processes now being experienced by developed societies , including new forms of racism , are a direct consequence of deregulated economic activities at the international level and of an inequitable and " wild " process of globalization .  
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
This is the most important resource possessed by our country , and the level of scientific development now attained is manifest in the existence of some 60 scientific research centres and an established body of scientists and research-workers that place Cuba on a level comparable with a number of averagely developed industrialized countries .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .  
In the Midrand Declaration , 7 member States of the Conference stated that it should be recognized that countries entered the new rules-based system of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) from very different starting points ; that , accordingly , the impact of globalization and liberalization was uneven ; and that the least developed countries , particularly those in Africa , remained constrained by weak supply capabilities and were unable to benefit from trade . 
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
Debt-relief measures for the least developed countries would help to release scarce resources in order to boost social and human development expenditure and to finance investment in critical economic restructuring in the short term and medium term .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
In order to increase the representation of women at the Professional level , FAO developed strategies to identify suitable female candidates and established a roster of international experts working in the area of women in development to be considered for future vacancies .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
Takes note of the work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in the field of the human genome to complete the preliminary draft of a universal declaration on the human genome and human rights , a standard _ setting framework urgently needed to ensure that such research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human dignity , in particular for the dignity and way of life of indigenous peoples ;  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons . 
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It was agreed that inter-agency coordination could be pursued by creating an interactive electronic mail network for information-sharing to serve as the medium for inter-agency contacts ; preparing an inventory of social programmes and projects ; conducting joint human resource training activities ; expanding to the rest of the region the system developed by CEFIR for observing the behaviour of social actors in integration ; and comparing the various work programmes in order to identify issues appropriate for inter-agency cooperation .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
The Committee notes that the Governing Council of UNEP , in its decision 19 / 31 of 7 February 1997 , requested the Executive Director to strengthen the regional offices of UNEP by providing them with appropriate functional and administrative capabilities to enable decentralized implementation of regional environmental programmes and priorities , as developed by regional and subregional ministerial meetings .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
An important medium of education and the heightening of awareness has been the " New Home , New Life " radio series developed by Mr . John Butt of the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , which incorporates cultural , social , economic , human rights , peace , health , conflict resolution , mine awareness and other issues of vital daily importance for the population of Afghanistan .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
In this connection , we express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for his initiative , in cooperation and coordination with the relevant international organizations , to assist the least developed countries to formulate integrated country programmes for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services , pursuant to the relevant decision of the Trade and Development Board at its annual session last year .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
In order to provide a pragmatic focus for the broad and ideal goals of the Plan of Action during the second decade of its implementation , a practical strategy on ageing was developed in 1992.3 The strategy consists of eight global targets on ageing for the year 2001 and 38 suggested national targets on ageing . 
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of peace and security ; strengthened and broadened the observance of human rights ; enhanced and developed international law and widened the scope of international penal law , in particular ; and laid the foundations for greater responsibility by States in the advancement of social progress .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
Unless the developed countries fulfil their commitment to reach the United Nations accepted target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and intensify their efforts to reverse the present downward trend , hopes for the least developed countries will remain as grim as ever .  
As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
These actions have strengthened the role of the University and allowed for alternative ways of improving quality of living , achieving sustainable development and contributing to the progress of less developed cultures .  
During his tenure of office , thanks to his outstanding leadership and his remarkable managerial skill , the Agency has developed into an international body of exemplary effectiveness and efficiency , faithfully fulfilling the objectives and principles set out in the Agency 's statute .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
To most developing countries , the sustainable development approach , as emphasized by most of our developed partners , is considered restrictive , limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment .  
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
In discussing its terms of reference , Committee members attached particular importance to ( a ) assessing world development trends and prospects ; ( b ) identifying national and international policies that would enhance the ability of developing countries and economies in transition to participate effectively in a globalizing world economy and achieve the goals agreed at United Nations global conferences ; and ( c ) undertaking periodic reviews of the list of least developed countries and the criteria used for identifying them .  
The Committee agreed to examine the following issues related to the impact of globalization on development : ( a ) globalization trends in trade , capital flows and technology transfer ; ( b ) factors leading to a homogeneous policy regime and its implications for development ; ( c ) implications of globalization for the international economy and international governance ; ( d ) recommendations for national policies , institutions and governance in developing countries ; ( e ) recommendations for policies in developed countries ; and ( f ) recommendations for policies of international organizations .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
While the proportion of people in absolute poverty may have been reduced as a result of rapid economic growth in some very large low-income developing countries ( notably China and India ) , the process of globalization has been accompanied by an increasing economic gap between the high and middle-income countries and the least developed countries . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
They emphasized the need for innovative approaches to address the complex and specific migratory flows that were taking place in the CIS States and highlighted the specific international standards that had been developed under the Programme of Action to address modern forms of involuntary and enforced migration , including forcibly displaced persons .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
In addition , China has developed rewarding systems for young people such as the Ten Top Chinese Young People , prominent young entrepreneurs , prominent young township entrepreneurs , young technical pace-setters , young skilful workers at their posts , rural young shooting star guides , the Chinese young scientist prize and Chinese youth science and technology pioneering prizes .  
One set of concerns focuses on the environmental , economic and social consequences of the resource-intensive consumption patterns of the developed world - and , increasingly , the rapidly industrializing countries - another on the multiple problems bound up with economic stagnation , poverty and environmental degradation in some developing countries .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations common system to develop and submit proposals to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
The same year , the annual party congress of FRELIMO decided to adopt the classical Soviet model for the organization and development of the country , and the Government developed close links with communist and socialist countries .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
The intense work undertaken during the interim period has laid some of the needed foundations for the necessary convergency between the efforts of affected country Parties and developed country Parties , thus paving the way for gradual progress at the field level of the arid lands marginalized by ecological degradation and poverty .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Governments and international organizations should apply , as soon as possible , the 20 / 20 concept and the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance , as accepted at the World Summit for Social Development and reinforced in the Platform for Action in a gender-balanced way .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
The topics discussed included the varying experiences of world regions regarding mortality , epidemiological and health transitions ; the problems faced in measuring mortality levels and mortality by cause of death , particularly in developing countries ; the various approaches to the measurement of health status and their limitations ; the health and mortality situation in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries ; and the relevance of risk factors underlying major causes of death for the formulation of health interventions .  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
In addition to the economic shocks , the legacy of communist rule in these countries was probably much more unfavourable than in central Europe : more ruthless regimes ensured that there was little , if any , reform before 1989 , and there was little opportunity for the emergence of opposition parties which might have developed coherent alternative programmes when eventually presented with the opportunity of taking over Government .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
These conflicting perceptions and the underlying policy dilemmas could be reconciled better in the context of a more comprehensive and global policy dialogue designed to promote coherent policies in all countries for more balanced growth and development and to reduce unemployment in developed and developing countries . 
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Members will recall that , on the occasion of that historic event , the debate about our common future was often polarized into the choice between rural sustainability and urban migration , between the green agenda and the brown agenda , between developed and developing economies .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
History has shown that the huge present-day inequalities between developed and poor countries are the result of centuries of plundering and exploitation during which civilizations , social structures and indigenous modes of production were destroyed and during which the ecosystems of Africa , America and Asia were pillaged .  
Nationally and regionally coordinated strategies should be developed for the implementation of the mandates and recommendations contained in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session , 1 / on 23 February 1990 , the Tehran Declaration adopted by the Ministerial-level Conference at the twenty-ninth session of the Subcommission , held at Tehran in 1992 , and other relevant international drug control instruments ;  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
Thailand 's space activities had developed in tandem with global space technology ; his delegation therefore appreciated the role played by COPUOS in strengthening international cooperation and norms for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , and fully supported the draft declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space .  
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
Its current social security scheme was undergoing a period of complex reforms and unemployment insurance was being developed , with emphasis on the promotion of economic activity of the unemployed in small towns and in rural areas , as well as the disabled .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
While it was currently agreed that economic globalization and the laws of the market had become the new rules of the game , the conditions in which the game was played were far from equitable and had aggravated the economic disparities between developed and developing countries .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
In addition , the formulation of national plans and their implementation would help create a favourable social , economic , political , health , educational and family environment for children , in both developed and developing countries .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
France is making a contribution to the Odin scientific satellite developed by Sweden and intended for the observation of the as yet unstudied electromagnetic spectral bands situated in the neighbourhood of wavelengths between 0.5 and 3 mm .  
Looking back at its record over the last 30 years , the Conference has developed an impressive set of international legal instruments that addresses in a comprehensive manner the security challenges posed by weapons of mass destruction .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Further , widespread discrimination based on gender , ethnicity and religious belief is reported daily and extreme poverty and marginalization is the fate of many in both developing and developed countries .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
At the same time , the Convention in other parts developed and codified many rules which were generally agreeable or even favourable to the industrialized States also ( e.g . related to the territorial waters or the exclusive economic zones ) .  
AOUIJ said that , although the extent to which political power was shared between women and men in Denmark constituted a model for developing and developed countries alike , economic power was not shared to the same extent .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring countries facing the Bay of Bengal and the quick notification of imported cases of this strain in developed countries raised global concern about a possible new pandemic of cholera .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
This ongoing work programme has developed a working list of indicators of sustainable development , divided into four categories social , economic , environmental and institutional .  
ECA has developed extensive collaborative relationships with the various global entities , regional and subregional organizations involved in economic and social development in Africa .  
It is for this reason that the logistic regression model was developed from , compared to and tested with the electronic claims for which the type of loss had been ascertained before being applied to the set of claims for which the type of loss was unknown .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , on a global scale the international community has moved forward slowly and has made only modest progress so far .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
The broad base of users was one reason why satellite communications had developed into a strong market , while the remote sensing data market was still in a somewhat developmental stage , although slowly growing .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .  
For instance , technology for space _ based extra _ atmospheric lightweight kinetic projectiles developed in the cold war is being used to develop a Navy Area Defense System capable of intercepting targets in outer space at an altitude of 500 km .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
But it was also necessary to cast a critical eye on the regulations applied in the global market , which was subject to far less rigorous supervision than that exercised by the national mechanisms of stable , developed economic systems .  
The target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the developed countries gross national product to official development assistance , which had been considered the absolute minimum two decades previously , now looked like an unattainable dream .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .  
Such treatments shall be applied in a determined scale to intermediate developed countries , and in a more favourable manner to countries at a relatively less advanced stage of economic development ; and ( e ) Multiple , to make possible various forms of agreements between member countries , following the objectives and duties of the integration process , using all instruments capable of activating and expanding markets at regional level .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
Urge developed countries and relevant organizations to review their international assistance in forestry to improve institutional capacities of developing countries , to base their assistance on the priorities identified in the national forest programmes of recipient countries , to increase effectiveness of available resources , and to increase their ODA contributions ;  
Since its foundation , the United Nations has developed a broad range of international standards , guidelines and model treaties in crime prevention and criminal justice that represent internationally agreed upon principles of desirable practice based on the rule of law .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
Turning to the question of trade and development , he said that , while trade liberalization was expected to bring about a considerable increase in global income , it must be recognized that , since the early 1970s , the least developed countries had suffered a cumulative decline of 50 per cent in their terms of trade , while the developing countries as a whole had lost $ 290-billion between 1981 and 1991 , which could be attributed to the decline in commodities prices . 
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
Reaffirms that any act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity and a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and reaffirmed and developed in other international instruments in this field , as well as a violation of the rules of international law ;  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
In that context , apart from increasing its annual contribution to UNRWA , Cyprus had in 1996 developed its own scheme of assistance to the Palestinians which included , inter alia , the construction of two medical centres in the West Bank , at a cost of $ 2.2-million , and a comprehensive programme of technical assistance and training for some 100 Palestinian officials , including follow-up visits by Cypriot experts to the autonomous areas .  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
In 1994 , it developed a plan of action to correct present imbalances in the participation of men and women in political life , and has collected statistical data on the outcome of legislative elections with respect to gender , maintained a Web site and issued statistical surveys on this subject . 
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Comprehensive revised guidelines for these types of contracts have been developed and will be implemented in 1999 , bearing in mind the primary objective of achieving value for money in an efficient and expeditious manner .  
This quite simple backbone or table of contents of issues to consider when drafting a competition law is then complemented in Part II of the Model Law with detailed commentary to the articles , in which a review is made of actual laws in both developed and developing countries , as well as countries in transition , with a view to determining the most recent trends and views on how best to treat each one of the issues considered in the elements for articles of the law contained in Part I .  
It takes place primarily between developed countries in the application of bilateral enforcement agreements , mutual legal assistance treates ( limited to criminal action aginst cartels ) , free trade , customs union or common market agreements , and the relevant OECD instruments . 
In addition to the need to underscore , for all concerned , the key role that the quality of public information and communications activities plays in the effectiveness and success of peacekeeping operations in the field , the Department has developed cooperative mechanisms , enabling it to provide the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other concerned departments with all the programmatic support necessary to undertake appropriate information programmes .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
Using the new UNIDO methodology , a preliminary integrated approach was developed which will address three main priorities : ( a ) contributing to an efficient , stable energy supply by improving the output of existing mini-hydro power plants and exploring alternative energy sources ; ( b ) providing general management training in basic industries and upgrading technical skills in priority sectors ; and ( c ) improving the access of the manufacturing sector to market intelligence services .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
Many delegations believed that modern information technology and a transparent information network were key to progress and development , and were keenly aware that the gulf between developed and developing countries in the global information network remained wide . 
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ; special issues of least developed countries / Africa / heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
Many delegations stated the belief that modern information technology and a transparent information network were key to progress and development , and were keenly aware that the gulf between developed and developing countries in the global information network remained wide . 
Surplus personnel have been disarmed and their identification cards withdrawn ; offices have been arranged by function rather than ethnicity ; senior staff have begun to hold regular joint meetings ; policies for bomb threats and explosion cases have been developed ; security plans for the return season that is beginning have been established ; and some inappropriate political symbols have been removed .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
In all such modifications , the Commission shall take into account the state of the technology being developed , the processing system utilized , the value and potential use of any waste , the environmental effects of the activities , the economic and resource data , and the international need for the mineral resources .  
Forms of participation by resident non-citizens should also be developed , including local voting rights after a certain period of residence and inclusion of elected non-citizen observers in municipal , regional and national legislative and decision-making assemblies ;  
Facing the growing threat of a global deflationary spiral , central banks in the major developed economies , led by the monetary authorities the Federal Reserve System or Fed of the United States , started to ease monetary policy in the autumn of 1998 .  
During short-term microgravity experiments on board aeroplanes , research will be conducted on the correlation between the electrophoretic direct current field and the variable gravity field with electrophoretic instruments for continuous free current stream in space and equipment for life science experiments on manned space missions will be developed and relevant scientific research initiated .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
The Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office is currently analysing the data to identify pilot or other opportunities for common arrangements to be carried out under memoranda of understanding among participating agencies ; identifying existing umbrella-type or joint contracting agreements that may be further utilized and developed under such memoranda ; and proposing for signature a standard inter-agency memorandum of understanding that provides the basis for common procurement arrangements .  
With regard to the issues of poverty , economic development and environment , we note with regret that the draft document failed to address the crucial and urgent need to establish better understanding at the international level , and a high level of international cooperation that will enable the developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular to realize success in these fields .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .  
Recognizing that they both take a substantive interest in areas of common concern and are committed to promoting a more comprehensive and relevant treatment of the subject matter while avoiding unproductive duplication and inconsistency of recommendations , the two Commissions have developed an elaborate coordinating mechanism .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
It should be mentioned that following consultations with non-governmental organizations acting in the field of HIV / AIDS and representatives of United Nations agencies working in Romania , it was decided to set up a national multisectoral AIDS commission to examine the potential spread of AIDS and its consequences for the Romanian population and to assess the programmes developed so far with a view to working out a national strategy against this dreadful malady .  
On the basis of the Cairo Programme of Action , Benin has developed a strategy we call the common minimum social welfare programme , aimed at improving the quality of life of families and covering a set of basic needs in five essential areas : health , education , food , developing people 's ability to create wealth , and opening up communities . 
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
Opinions were sought also from experts in restrictive business practices in some developed countries and international organizations regarding the quality of the analytical studies prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat and the commentaries on the model law , which are revised periodically .  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
They had also given themselves a goal of full cost recovery within five years , and the objective was being realized by providing their target group of firms at the initial stage of operation with a free diagnostic service ( based on the diagnostic tools developed by CODETI , among others ) ; thereafter , a fee based on the outcome of the diagnostic exercise and the projected savings to be made by each firm would be negotiated with the particular client enterprise .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Considering that commercial mining has the potential to impact vast areas of the seafloor , the scientific experts developed a proposal for a cooperative research project involving in situ manipulative field experiments under carefully controlled conditions . 
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .  
Nevertheless , concern is expressed at the lack of practical implementation of these principles , in particular that the child 's right to express his / her views in a judicial or administrative procedure affecting him / her , as established in article 17 of the Code on Children and Adolescents , may not be respected in all cases in a culture where respect of the views of the child is not fully developed . 
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
The Board observed that , in the short to medium term , improved agricultural performance offered many of the least developed countries the most effective way to raise economic growth rates and expand and diversify exports .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
An expeditious accession process for the least developed countries which were not members of WTO , on terms consistent with their status , was seen as an integral part of their efforts to reverse their current marginalization in world trade and to become integrated into the world economy and international trading system .  
The international community committed itself , in the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action , to urgent and effective action , based on the principle of shared responsibility and strengthened partnership , to arrest and reverse the deterioration in the socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and to revitalize their growth and development .  
The international community , particularly the developed countries , collectively committed itself to a significant and substantial increase in supporting the efforts of the least developed countries to mobilize and develop their human capacities and the development of their economic base .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
It is now a fully functioning international criminal court , holding regular hearings , with a normative framework completed and in operation and close and productive working relationships developed with international organizations working in the former Yugoslavia .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
Ways should be found to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the formulation of international standards , a very costly process , and gain access to mutual recognition agreements concluded progressively among developed countries ( and which discriminate against developing countries ) , as well as to meet sanitary and phytosanitary regulations .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
The asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks arising from globalization warrants a global social contract between developing and developed countries , based on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility and with the active involvement of non-State stakeholders with a view to creating a rule-based international system where all countries could take full advantage of the process and where the stronger countries recognize and respect the constraints of the weaker ones .  
Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
Of course , evolution of the international situation means that it is appropriate for existing rules of international law to be developed and adapted to prevailing conditions , but this should be done through collective discussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions , not as a fait accompli and not working from scratch : it should be based on valid rules of international law .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
Our rich flora and fauna , marine life , mineral wealth and human potential is unparalleled , and this God-given untapped wealth can best be developed not by a single country but by our Mano River Union .  
On the other hand , commitments undertaken under IMF / World Bank Structural Adjustment Programmes have reinforced and widened WTO commitments and accelerated the adoption of non-reciprocal autonomous liberalization measures , and bilateral agreements with major developed countries have further reduced the remaining policy options and WTO flexibility . 
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Notes with appreciation the growing number of developed countries participating in triangular cooperation and encourages the use of such cooperation by other countries and , in this context , requests the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the countries that have been supporting such cooperation , to document and disseminate relevant lessons learned and to identify options for the exploitation of the full potential of such cooperation ;  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Given the special difficulties faced by African countries in their effective participation in the multilateral trading system , the workshop held at Pretoria also addressed their specific concerns , taking into account the outcome of the Coordinating Workshop for Senior Advisers to Ministers of Trade of least developed countries in preparation for the WTO Ministerial Conference , held at Sun City , South Africa ( 21-25 June 1999 ) .  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
Our presence here is proof of the fact that , astonishing though it may seem , the newly developed media and means of communication can not satisfy the need human beings feel for personal and direct contact in order to establish a dialogue conducive to peace this fact was certainly not lost on the founding fathers of the United Nations system .  
Recognizing that , while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty through the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with a long-term perspective ,  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
More coherent policies , established on the basis of broad consensus , should be developed , bearing in mind the need to respect the principle of sovereignty and to ensure flexibility in the policies affecting developing countries , particularly in areas such as the management of capital flows and the choice of capital account regime .  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
The administrative and technical structure of primary health care has been developed at the central and local levels in such a way as to constitute an integrated system conducive to the promotion of development through collaboration among all the sectors concerned with health and development .  
The therapeutic sector must be strengthened , modernized and developed through the establishment of health institutions , provided with the requisite modern equipment and facilities and qualified medical staff , in all parts of the Syrian Arab Republic .  
The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the internship system have been developed and the Ministry awards 40 specialized medical diplomas after theoretical and practical training in accordance with the most up-to-date scientific syllabuses .  
Sharing experiences and information , improving capacity of responding to the specific needs of women within the environment where they operate , improve the quality of the actions developed and , so that they can work in articulation with the Commission , as well as in cooperation with social and economical agents at the councils level , namely employment centres and enterprises for equal opportunity .  
The Government , in cooperation with the private sector , had also sought to provide shelter and rehabilitative services to girls who had been sexually abused , and a national plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children was being developed .  
If world commodity markets are left to the &amp; lt ; free play of market forces = , while much high-cost agriculture in developed countries - - even after the Uruguay Round - - continues to be subsidized , the underlying problem of the downward trend in real prices of commodities exported by developing countries is likely to persist .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Their activities were legitimate , competitive and regulated ; they were not dissimilar from those of developed countries that encouraged foreign direct investment .  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
While developed countries had remained relatively unscathed by the recent financial crisis , in developing countries the gains of decades of economic and social progress had been erased overnight and millions had been thrown back into poverty .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
The Dominican Republic is convinced that reform of the Security Council must be carried out in keeping with the principles of equitable geographical distribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States , since no reform will be acceptable if it leads to discriminatory treatment of developing nations by developed nations .  
I call upon every Member State , large and small , developed and developing , rich and poor , to work cooperatively to find meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this growing international problem and challenge .  
As a result , Bahrain has been able to build an open and developed economy that has made it possible for the country to realize comprehensive and sustainable human development , as reflected in its remarkable ranking in the human development index for five consecutive years .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
However , we can not fail to point out that this benefit will not come to everyone equally ; nor can we accept passively the idea that the great majority of people in underdeveloped countries are doomed by massive , dire poverty , hunger , poor health and malnutrition not to be a part of these optimistic statistics but , rather , to be included in the morbidity and mortality statistics characteristic of the less developed regions of the world .  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
In that connection , the situation of the African continent is alarming : nearly two thirds of the least developed countries are located there ; approximately half of its population lives below the threshold of absolute poverty ; and its social indicators are among the lowest in the world .  
In addition , the enormous force of globalization , driven by the advancement of science and technology , instead of serving to unify humankind in a determined and conscious assault against the persistent and systemic problems of our time , is continuously being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak , and is thereby widening the gap between the developed and the developing worlds .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
In this decade the international legal order has been further developed , a number of new States have emerged , the new role and growing strength of the regional organizations has been confirmed , and strong emphasis has been placed on human rights .  
Once again , we call for developing countries to be able to participate on an equal footing with developed countries in the codification and gradual development of international law as an essential premise for establishing a just and equitable international legal order in the next century.The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m .  
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
Indeed , it is in the best interest of the process that the procedural issues pertaining to the meetings be carried out in a swift and prudent manner to allow the actual meeting period to be dedicated to more substantive work.We further support the notion reflected in the draft resolution that , with regard to the appointment of the co-chairpersons , there needs to be representation from both developed and developing countries .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
We are aware , however , that the full potential of confidence-building can be developed only in conjunction with further political steps that require the steady , persistent and sometimes painstaking effort of the international community .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
Having recognized the value of open economies , we should , however , be ready to address emerging population problems such as increasing migration including transit migration , outflow of the most productive young strata of society from the less developed economies to the more prosperous ones , drug trafficking and the spread of AIDS and other dangerous diseases , to name but a few .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
Qatar , which is aware of the international communitys important role in helping small island developing States and other developing countries achieve social development , hopes that the States of the developed world will play their proper role in supporting the economies of developing countries and in reducing the consequences of globalization on our fragile economies .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
The importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes is reaffirmed .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
To be sure , global conventional energy resources are adequate to meet the projected growth in energy services for decades to come , provided that technology is developed to exploit and utilize these resources in an efficient manner ; the total energy resource base is expected to be expanded by the development and application of renewable sources .  
Policies for rural development and rural energy policies should be developed and implemented in a mutually reinforcing way and appropriate government agencies within the responsible ministry for national energy policy should be assigned specific duty for rural energy , in some cases at the local or provincial levels .  
The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties . 
Thus , to be relevant for least developed country identification , an index of vulnerability needs to be concerned with economic vulnerability resulting essentially from structural factors , and to reflect the main kinds of exogenous shocks faced by low-income countries and their exposure to these shocks .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
As explained above ( para . 131 ) , the application of the agreed set of criteria for the designation of least developed countries goes beyond statistical calculations particularly in otherwise marginal cases to the careful assessment both of the numerical results and of supplementary information to be collected , especially a set of vulnerability profiles .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
It reviewed the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of key interventions for adolescent health , highlighted the essential factors and strategies needed to establish , implement and sustain programmes for adolescent health , developed a common framework for country programming and recommended priority actions to accelerate and strengthen programming for adolescent health , including the global and regional support needed for country-level programming .

A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
In short , the draft convention merely serves to protect the interests of developed countries , such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America , which have long _ standing international maritime traditions or a large merchant marine fleet and , consequently , wish to protect their ships from the calamity of arrest , which would prevent them from operating .  
HIC regional networks and committees organized their own Habitat II processes to contribute to the Conference ; the myriad of activities , projects , meetings , publications and other contributions of these civil society processes developed , managed and promoted by HIC and its members could not be listed within this brief space , which notes only some direct HIC contributions to the official process .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
Modelling is most advanced in the field of global warming and climate change , and those models are gradually being developed and linked to other models to take account of demographic trends , land use changes , economic development projections and freshwater supplies , as well as atmospheric and oceanic factors .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
Further standards are likely to be elaborated and mechanisms established at the international level , especially to ensure that genetic research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human rights and dignity , particularly of vulnerable groups of people . 
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
This tragic event was only the forerunner to a series of catastrophic explosions which continued into 1998 and which have destroyed or made inaccessible most of the formerly developed and densely populated southern part of the island .  
Since the sixth session of the Commission , a functioning prototype of the system has been developed , consisting of a revised international site and a demonstration national node , and mock-ups of regional and institutional nodes .  
The Act was accompanied by a decree _ law establishing local boards ( 324 nationwide ) to administer the guaranteed minimum wage ; they are a key element in what is an example of good governance on poverty in the developed world , grounded in the reinforcement of the local mutual aid network by linking official administrators with community organizations .  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
Those materials included international human rights instruments , memorandum and election reports issued by the Special Representative , relevant domestic laws , training curricula , and free and fair elections posters developed by the office .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;

Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
In selecting the priority themes to be addressed at the high-level event , it was important to choose areas where greater understanding of the complex issues of development financing might be achieved ; where solid results might be attained ; where the impact of the measures taken could be maximized ; and where special emphasis could be given to the specific problems faced by the least developed countries .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The reality shows that the globalization process , based on the international economic relations favourable only for the developed countries , is aggravating poverty in the developing countries and widening disparities between the rich and the poor countries .

The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
The representative of France , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed through extrabudgetary resources .  
In line with the request of the Assembly that the Secretary-General take additional measures to ensure that the representatives of least developed countries are fully aware and duly informed in a timely manner of their entitlements to travel to sessions of the Assembly , the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services includes in the note verbale inviting representatives of least developed countries to attend the regular and special sessions of the Assembly an annex regarding their entitlements related to travel .  
The main challenge lies both for developed and developing countries in the development , utilization and dissemination of renewable energy technologies , such as solar , wind , ocean , wave , geothermal , biomass and hydro power , on a scale wide enough to significantly contribute to energy for sustainable development .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Efforts to establish an international enabling environment should be conducted in a spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and taking into account the specific conditions of individual countries , in accordance with the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 .  
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Special Fund had been established by the Assembly in its resolution 1240 ( XIII ) of 14 October 1958 to provide , inter alia , systematic and sustained assistance in fields essential to the integrated technical , economic and social development of the less developed countries .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .  
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
[ 31 ] Experience shows that farmers both in developed and developing countries are aware of the environmental , occupational and health improvements that organic production can generate [ 32 ] , but their main motivation is still improved income in the short-term , [ 33 ] rather than concern about the environment in the longer term . 
In terms of regular resources from private sector , UNICEF has consolidated a unique network of national committees in industrialized countries ( raising one third of UNICEFs resources ) and has developed alliances with important corporations , foundations and non-governmental organizations .  Those efforts resulted in a net income of US $ 165-million , which combined with the US $ 343-million from Governments and US $ 55 million from other income makes the total of US $ 563-million in core funding for 2001 .  
Stresses the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , and requests the Secretary-General to make detailed recommendations in this regard to the Council within six months of the adoption of this resolution , which should be developed in close consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes ;  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
The UNDP Environment Policy Adviser and the Procurement Adviser have developed basic environmental guidelines , an overview of the key issues involved , sources of detailed and reliable information and generic recommendations on major procurement items for use by the Advisory Committee on Procurement and country offices .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
We request the international community to strongly support poverty eradication , and welcome the ongoing consultations by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication to finance and realize , inter alia , the social policies and programmes of the Habitat Agenda to address challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries , especially the least developed countries , bearing in mind the voluntary nature of the contributions .  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
Below 500-m3 , the situation becomes critical and between 100 and 200-m3 , the situation is considered a severe water shortage . 38 There is also a considerable inequality in consumption of water between developed and developing countries and over-consumption by the wealthy mirrors the under-consumption of the poor . 
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) of 31 January 2001 , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes . 
In addition , the methodology moves away from an expert approach , in which the communication expert produces the communication component of the programme , towards participatory communication planning , where all of the countrys team members ( from government , UNICEF , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations ) are involved in the planning , with beneficial results in terms of sharing and learning skills as well as ownership of the final product , which has in itself important implications for the implementation of the strategic communication plan developed .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
Urges developed country Parties to provide technical and financial assistance , as appropriate , through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative programmes to support the efforts of the Parties in implementing the programmes and measures identified in the annexed framework and to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention ;  
This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
It was noted that the implementation of UR Agreements had not visibly improved their countries market access opportunities largely due to : high trade barriers remaining in the developed country markets ; increasing stringency of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical standards and erosion of preferential tariff margins , be it actual or the threat thereof .  
As the implementation of the UR had not been satisfactory to Moroccos interests , it considered that the trade and support measures adopted by developed countries should be significantly reduced , particularly as agriculture constituted the principal economic activity of a large number of developing countries .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
The representative of Singapore , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said the Expert Meeting had provided a unique opportunity for national experts from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to share their experience and to express their views and concerns in an international forum on the impact of AD / CVD actions .  
[ 27 ] Thus , in the absence of a uniform legal framework , voluntary systems are being developed ( discussed below , paras . 52-62 ) which replicate the functions of the traditional bills of lading and are supported by contractual rules binding on the parties . 
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
While least developed countries should assume ownership of designing and formulating appropriate national policies of their own will and choice so as to create conditions conducive to development , and continue to have the primary responsibility for effective implementation of those policies and measures , the full implementation of the Programme of Action is the shared responsibility of these countries and their development partners .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
It calls for the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative on the basis of mutual agreement and commitment by donors and least developed countries , and recognizes that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and from external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
Development partners committed to supporting the least developed countries in their development of energy resources , including renewable energy , natural gas and other clean energy sources , and to facilitating the transfer of technology for the development of clean energy technologies in accordance with relevant international agreements .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
Given the attention being paid to international norms for products entering trade , it was an important step that development partners committed to providing assistance to least developed countries in developing infrastructure to ensure quality control and conformity to international standards of their products and to avoiding taking unilateral action in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
It was acknowledged that the large investment requirements of least developed countries and the very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources , implied a need for new and additional resources and efforts to increase ODA to least developed countries supportive of national programmes of action , including poverty eradication strategies .  
On their part , the debtor least developed countries will aim at maximizing benefits from debt relief by creating a conducive national framework including fiscal reforms , a budgetary framework , sectoral adjustments , contributing to poverty eradication and faster economic growth , export growth , increased investment , enhanced productive capacities , employment and productivity , savings and international competitiveness .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
The national programmes of action identified the difficulties and constraints faced by least developed countries and the required national and international support measures to eradicate poverty , overcome the structural bottlenecks in least developed countries and put these countries on the path of accelerated growth and sustainable development .  
Just prior to the Conference , the Ministers of the least developed countries met in Brussels on 13 May 2001 and adopted a Declaration21 in which they stressed that while the primary responsibility for the development of least developed countries rested with these countries themselves , the amelioration of the worsening social economic conditions in the least developed countries required , among other things , substantial and concrete international support measures . 
The Ministers declared that the success of the Conference would be measured by the nature and extent of action-oriented and operational commitments that would have the greatest impact and significantly contribute to arresting and decisively reversing marginalization , eradicating poverty and thereby improving the social economic conditions in the least developed countries .  
We have the honour to inform you that at two urgent and successive meetings , the first of the Follow-up Committee of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference and the second of the Islamic Group , both held yesterday , at the ambassadorial level , grave concern was expressed over the deteriorating situation that has developed in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem .  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
The representative of Belgium , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) , stated that although the economic concerns of the least developed countries had been at the forefront of the development debate for more than three decades , the results were not encouraging .  He observed that the Brussels Declaration provided hope that the next decade would be different from the previous two .  
He stated that LDC-III had provided a good opportunity to review the daunting development crisis in LDCs and that the Conference recognized LDCs critical need for concrete support from the developed countries in terms of resources for development , debt relief , enhanced market access for their products and increased FDI , among other things .  
The panellists hoped that the coordinated monetary stimulus by the major developed countries , as well as the supportive fiscal measures , would lessen the negative impact of the attacks and strengthen economic recovery .  
Regarding the economic situation in Asia one panellist expressed the view that pessimism was exaggerated despite the regions dependence on exports of electronic goods , a still incomplete process of banking and corporate restructuring , and a decline in the stock markets steeper than in most developed countries .  
That had been particularly evident during negotiations on the agenda for the forthcoming World Trade Organization ( WTO ) Ministerial Conference , for , despite high-level pronouncements that trade should promote development , the negotiations had revolved around the need to secure additional benefits for developed countries as a precondition for discussing issues that were critical to the development of most developing countries . 
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
He reaffirmed his countrys full support for the recommendations contained in the outcome documents of the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly , which had enhanced the international communitys awareness of the nature of the social and developmental problems facing the worlds peoples , particularly in developing and least developed countries .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed in consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes .  
Despite its own economic difficulties in the wake of the financial crisis in Asia , the Government had maintained its commitment to official development assistance ( ODA ) , which included cooperative programmes emphasizing local ownership and promoting human resources development in partnership with least developed countries . 
To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
They had been asked to establish an environment conducive to capital flows , yet foreign direct investment flows to the developing countries were continually shrinking and were expected to diminish by another 6 per cent in 2001 , especially since the climate in the developed countries was more uncertain , the risks were greater and investment returns were lower . 
He outlined the main activities undertaken by the secretariat , where priority continued to be given to least developed countries , and the progress achieved with regard to the utilization of developing countries capacities in the implementation of technical cooperation and with respect to the financial sustainability of selected technical cooperation programmes .  
It has developed a system of assistance which is available to citizens in all age groups ( including day homes for children and adolescents , care centres for children and adolescents , State socio-educational centres , social family lodgings , care centres for handicapped persons , integrated centres for the elderly , nursing homes , gerontological revalidation units , psycho-geriatric centres and senior citizen clubs for the elderly , home-help services , shelters for the homeless and foster homes ) .  
Moving beyond mere cohabitation and to achieve interpenetration and bring about a genuinely multicultural society would make mutual recognition and interaction an integral part of daily life for everyone - the mosaic being the harmonious living arrangement that needs to be developed .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;  
The organization developed an approach using lay people to develop indicators for sustainable development ; public round tables were held , and long-term thinking was encouraged .  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
The future work of PARIS 21 will concentrate on three main areas : ( a ) broadening the coverage of the initiative to areas beyond anglophone Africa ; ( b ) deepening the work already started by encouraging bilateral donors and trust funds to assist countries with the action plans developed at the subregional workshops ; and ( c ) completing and disseminating the materials resulting from the task team work .  
Recognizing that the main role of UNIDO lies in providing technical cooperation to the developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition , in relation to those support functions in which the Organization has a competitive advantage , such as strengthening of industrial capacities and cleaner sustainable industrial development and also giving assistance to those countries to participate effectively in international trade ,  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas , with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being , and in this regard encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Regret that , although the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region have made progress in promoting a more favourable environment for technology transfer and for new clean , energy-efficient approaches to production together with the corresponding technical knowledge particularly through the establishment of suitable systems for the protection of intellectual property , the developed countries have not adopted effective measures for ensuring transfers of , in particular , the most appropriate technologies in terms of environmental , social and economic sustainability .  
To call for steps to be taken at the Summit to be held in Johannesburg to foster the establishment of effective means of facilitating technology transfer and new approaches to production under more favourable conditions , in keeping with principle 9 of the Rio Declaration , based , in particular , on the establishment by developed countries of financial mechanisms and preferential forms of tax treatment .
