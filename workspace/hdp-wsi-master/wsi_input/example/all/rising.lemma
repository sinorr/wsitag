The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice .

China 's WTO accession has accentuated the problems of non-competitive SOE 's , including large portfolios of non-performing loans ; mounting public debt ; a sizable pension deficit ; regional polarities with rising unemployment and labour redundancies ; continued efforts in strengthening a law-based business environment with a higher level of consistency and corporate governance ; the demand for more investment capital ; and the need for more training and re-training in the skills and expertise for international businesses . 
The current deficit is serious and is threatening to undermine our financial strength and market confidence .  If the problem is not solved as soon as possible , Hong Kong risks being exposed to heightened speculation , which may trigger outflows of capital , rising interest rates , turmoil in the financial markets leading ultimately to possible attacks on our linked exchange rate system .  
The Government is committed to ensure that the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance ( CSSA ) Scheme is effective and sustainable in the long run and that limited public resources are used in the most optimal manner to meet the rising caseload , the Secretary for Health , Welfare and Food , Dr Yeoh Eng-kiong said .  
Many public services in Hong Kong are heavily subsidised and various sectors in the community have expressed the view that the Government needs to take urgent steps to address rising public spending on social and other services , particularly in the light of population aging and continuing influx of new immigrants . 
For salaries tax of different income groups the lowest rate for taxpayers is 1.2% , rising gradually to a maximum of 16% .  The average effective tax rate for over 800 000 taxpayers with annual incomes between $ 100,000 and $ 300,000 is a mere 2.3% , and the amount of tax payable per month is only $ 350 .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
The rapidly rising standard of living in the Republic of China has led to the increasing diversification of life for its citizens . As options increase , the average citizen becomes busier - - previous chores become more difficult to accomplish as a greater proportion of time is spent engaged in differing activities .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
Wave after wave they stretch , chimneys rising bold and upright . Accompanying them is the rich green of the grass , the deep blue of the sky . (  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
With rising environmental consciousness , there has been active support for the Orchid Island horned owl , the orchids , and other rare flora and fauna . But very few people have thought to look after the island 's Yami people , a national treasure , by offering them medical services . This has caused the island 's medical standards to be , like its geographic location , quite distant from Taiwan .  
Decoration costs and rising rents were soon reflected in menu prices , and " sometimes their meals were more pricey than any ordinary restaurant . " Mr . Yang maintains that once beer parlors started charging stiff prices and had lost the advantage of novelty all the charm went out of them , their unique atmosphere evaporated and their business started tailing off .  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
Another prominent young Chinese of the upper echelons is Jose Chen Barria , previous head of the Bureau of Immigration , and current deputy chief auditor , who is considered something of a rising star .  
With rust-proof steel , plate glass , and glossy flat faces that looked like they had been cleaved with a knife , these plate glass buildings , rising like giant mirrors into the clouds , marked a new milestone in construction techniques . They are perfect company for the cold , rational , progressive sense of the modern city .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
A tourism and vacation island : As for the landward scenery , because Lu Tao is com posed of accumulated volcanic rock , and sits in the high-temperature , heavy-precipitation tropical rain forest climatic zone , the island is covered with rising and falling peaks which are flourishing with life all year round .  
But Taiwanese have turned out to be much more interested in watching sporting events than anyone had anticipated , and professional baseball is on a hot streak . The first year attendance was 899,955 , rising to l , 60O , 500 by the fourth year . With an average ticket costing NT $ 150 , total revenue reached more than NT $ 240 million .  
This is quite different from the sandy beaches characteristic of other parts of the island . Another special feature of the eastern coast is the sharply rising coral reefs and rock platforms . There are many types of colorful channels and caves cut into the coral reefs by erosion .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
Shrines are everywhere on the broad yellow ground . There are many steps leading up the sharply rising platforms ( pyramid-like structures but level on top rather than coming to an apex ) , testing the endurance of tourists . The site also has the earliest astronomical observatory in Mesoamerica .  
For instance , the limitless rebirth of life forms exists within cultural change and natural cycles of waxing and waning and rising and falling . And I have connected the symbols and visual vocabulary employed in each of these twelve works to the twelve signs of the zodiac , which represent the rhythmic relationship between Heaven and Earth .  
The main culprits causing newspaper publishers to feel panicky are familiar : the rising price of paper worldwide ; economic downturns ; and constantly improving electronic technology , so that newspapers find it harder and harder to be as timely as TV or radio .  
What one sees is what is left after the violence , circles of shards amid the silence . With Tsong Pu 's exquisite and mature installation technique , the small and large pottery shards arranged in their disordered way create a rhythm between strong and weak and rising and falling that is similar to what is found in poetry .  
In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation . But rapid planting of single-species forests in previously cleared areas implies that in the future , each such area will contain only one producer species , thus limiting biodiversity and creating incomplete and fragmentary food chains .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Other fields are also booming : With Y2K just around the corner , demand for computer experts is rising . There 's a great demand for marketing personnel in the mobile phone industry . The financial , insurance , and real estate industries are moving toward increasing professionalization and are absorbing and training a large number of new people .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
Increasingly complex parent-child rela-tions , a rising divorce rate , and seemingly insoluble marital problems are causing people to feel more and more that " the family is sick . " That 's bad enough , but the succession of child abuse , domestic violence , incest , and other cases which have been appearing in the news one after another are causing people to fear that " the family may be harmful ! "  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange . Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .  
Some paddies are full of plants rising above the water to all different heights . Others are set aside just for lotus and water lily . Bits of clouds and blue sky reflect between the plants off the broken surface of the water . Plants of every description cover the raised earthen barriers between the different paddies , their tiny maroon , yellow , and white blossoms standing out brilliantly in the sun .  
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even-as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people-in different countries , many middle-aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
Nonetheless , compared with other Asian countries , Taiwanese people 's sense of their own good fortune is subdued . Recently the media have frequently pinpointed rising " discomfort indicators , " focusing on unemployment , the departure of industry overseas , falling stock prices and an adverse economic outlook , so that people are dogged by anxieties .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice . While people should make as serious a commitment to marriage as they do to a career , as in a career one can change course or start again . When a marriage really can not be xxxxsustained , divorce should be a socially acceptable alternative , and does not symbolize personal failure or moral bankruptcy .  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
Before me lay a vast lifeless stretch of yellow , the terrifying Sahara desert that I had read about in geography textbooks when I was a child . Only now it was n't just a name , but was a real place , right under my feet . How could one not feel a rising sense of panic ? !  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
The spokesman said that the success of the capital increase is an inevitable result of the improvement of China 's comprehensive national power With the rising of international status , China will surely play an even more active role in international economic and financial sectors  
After the 1980s , which had been a lost decade for development , trends for the 1990s were not very encouraging : growing instability , uneven development , slow economic recovery and rising unemployment in the industrialized countries .  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
We must now assuage our hurt by rising above our differences and coalesce into a strong , unified nation , determined to move forward to a better and prosperous future .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
With rising incomes the poor should be able to afford rudimentary but satisfactory sanitation facilities with some technical advice on sewage disposal facilities from the Government , but it will remain the responsibility of the Government to provide basic health care and safe drinking water facilities to the poor wherever they are located .  
The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is marked by a complex network of external and internal factors that contribute to economic and political uncertainty and rising social tension .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Furthermore , many industrialized countries of the North have experienced rising unemployment rates , inequitable resource distribution and unanticipated increases in poverty even as their economies were pronounced sound and their gross national product ( GNP ) continued to rise .

The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
It is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .

Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account .

obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
With the new global changes , with our recent adoption of the CTBT , with rising optimism regarding the Conference on Disarmament , with what can be perceived as a genuine desire for peace , and with more meaningful international collaboration in the areas of economic cooperation and development , there is some hope for achieving lasting peace and security in our world .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
Capital spending has been the main engine of growth in the current cycle , with non-residential fixed investment in 1993-1995 rising at annual average rates of close to 14 per cent in real terms .  
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
Although adolescent fertility is increasingly perceived as an issue of social and policy concern , fertility rates among women under age 20 have been falling alongside overall fertility rates world wide , owing to rising age at marriage , increasing educational opportunities for young women and increased use of contraception .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
The driving forces behind increasingly serious water problems include rapid world population growth - in terms of both rapid urbanization and rural populations growing beyond local carrying capacity - and rising expectations and dependence on reliable water-related services to meet social needs , economic activity and food production .  
Finally , a rising incidence of occasional or " weekend prostitution " by young housewives or students wanting to improve their standard of living by prostituting themselves on weekends or for a limited period of time , as a direct result of the economic crisis and unemployment , is becoming apparent .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .

Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
The Conference of Ministers of ECA was convinced that trade and investment were essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate development in the countries of Africa and sustain high rates of economic growth , and that poverty , which constituted the most serious problem facing African society , could be reduced and eventually eradicated by sustained high rates of economic growth that was broad-based and geared to creating employment and generating rising incomes .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
The number of such associations is constantly rising , and their diverse objectives include childcare , encouraging the work and education of women , raising women 's awareness of educational , health , social and legal matters and providing vocational training for women in skills such as dressmaking , printing and domestic food preparation .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
The right to a healthy environment has been violated as a result of human activities which increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , with all the consequent effects on global warming , rising sea levels and climate in general .  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
The Forum recognized and endorsed the deep concerns regarding the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on rising sea levels and changing weather patterns on all Forum members , especially low-lying island nations , as recorded in the Statement on Climate Change and Sea Level Rise issued by the seventh Economic Summit of Smaller Island States Leaders held in Rarotonga on 12 and 13 September 1997 .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
In the next century , the planet Earth faces the potential hazard of rapid environmental changes , including global warming , rising mean sea level , deforestation , desertification and land degradation , ozone depletion , acid rain and a reduction in biodiversity .  
With rising worldwide demand for mobile satellite services , especially in developing countries , which often lack an adequate terrestrial telephone line infrastructure , planned LEO and MEO systems will supplement GEO satellite communications services .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
Because living standards are falling , prices for food and medicines are rising and social pensions are inadequate for the needs of our times , the draft law on State benefits in Kyrgyzstan provides for social benefits for people with congenital disabilities to be raised from 50 to 200 per cent of the guaranteed minimum income , depending on the disability group and the cause of disability . 
As for the acts committed ( factor a above ) , the historical and evidentiary record suggests cases of murder ( rising to the level of extermination of political opposition ) , forced labour , torture and other inhumane acts .  
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
Some are threatened by uncontrolled development of the economic activities they help to sustain ; others by introduced species of animals and plants ; still others by changing conditions such as rising sea temperature linked to global warming .
