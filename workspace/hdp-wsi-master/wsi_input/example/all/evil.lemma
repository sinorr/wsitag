To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Immediately after this , corrupt and immoral people stopped their evil practice , the " court was shocked , and those treacherous and cunning held their breath " .  Even Fu Jian admired the great benefit such management had brought about .  
Zhang Shiming , who has been engaged in long-term research on innovative utilization of straw , believes that it is still necessary at present to accelerate the implementation of strengthening the country through science and education , the development of science , and increasing the scientific level of the entire nation .  In this way , it will enable the broad masses of the people to enhance their abilities to ward off the disturbance and destruction caused by the evil cult organization of " Falungong " .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .  It is also a vigorous test for the public security organs : in order to crack down , first the problem has to be faced squarely , the " protective umbrella " for the dark and evil forces has to be uncovered , and the intertwining network of connections has to be destroyed ;  
We have to clearly recognize that the reason why the dark and evil forces can be so rampant in some localities is exactly because extremely few public security personnel or even government officials are acting as their " protective umbrella . "  This is an important factor which can not be overlooked in the struggle of " hitting the mob and eliminating devils " .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi . They had lost their sense of reasoning as normal human beings when they turned their backs on their loved ones , their family , their school and the normal society .  
Compared with the Yuanhua case , the Chaoshan tax fraud case involves not only huge sums but also evil methods ; the corrupt officials " united as one to cheat the old CPC " and " worked with concerted efforts to plunder the state treasury , " and in addition the methods they used were that of " white wolves with empty gloves " and they directly plundered more than RMB 100-billion from the state treasury by fraudulent means .  
Korea 's ruling party and opposition parties also issued a statement specifically saying that they unanimously and strongly blamed Japan for planning to pass this history textbook , and achieving the evil goal of twisting history and whitewashing their past barbaric behavior towards Asian people .  They also demanded that the Korean government marshall all its forces to take a decisive counteraction toward Japan .  
Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
In this special fight against the evil forces , local authorities , party and government departments , and law enforcement authorities at all levels must work with one mind and with firm resolve .  While we must take quick , thunderbolt-like actions to rebuff the brazenness of the evil forces , we must also take thorough and careful moves to smash the protective shelters that harbor these evil forces so as to completely destroy their structures and cut their poisonous vines in our society .  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
It was not long before China 's underworld organizations and evil forces rapidly spread and become rampant throughout the country .  They have seriously endangered the people 's life , infringed upon their property , undermined their security and threatened the political , economic , and social stability of the country .  
The criminal syndicates and evil forces often use unscrupulous tactics to collect illegitimate wealth and frantically seek profits .  They use the syndicate to protect businesses , while letting the businesses " feed " the " syndicate . "  They have seriously disrupted the economic order of the state and hampered the reform and opening-up program and the smooth development of the socialist modernization drive .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .  
We must introduce more excellent ideological and artistic work , encourage better scenes that are positive and forward-looking as well as healthy and beneficial , and produce more good literary writings that are to the point and clear , as well as drive out evil and usher in good .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
Those who are unjust will definitely reap their own evil fruits .  Just as stated by Western mass media : US losses in the elections reflected " what it deserved " and " a price it must pay " for its foreign policy .  The United States has lifted a rock to drop it onto its own feet .  
In the full-scale armed rebellion started by Dalai to maintain the " wonderful " feudal serfdom , as they claimed , the rebels headed by Dalai , under the banners of " safeguarding religion " and " protecting national interests , " split the motherland , killed compatriots , looted monasteries , blasphemed religion , and raped women , stopping at nothing in doing evil .  
The Hunan Command has altogether spent 1,200 man-times for such tasks as cordoning off the crime scene , armed arrests , armed escorts , and armed patrol in the urban areas in coordination with the local public security organs .  The command has successfully handled a number of cases involving sinister and evil forces that were of relatively wider impact , including the Hengyang " 6 December " incident and the Zhuzhou City " 10 March " arrests and mop-up , capturing 12 criminals , seizing one pistol and 50 bullets .  
According to the incomplete estimates of the departments concerned , at present the armed police units , in coordination with the public security organs , have smashed nearly 1,000 sinister and evil gangs and arrested tens of thousands of criminals .  They have thus demonstrated the strength of the police force and given prominence to what is right .  This has held the sinister and evil forces deeply in awe and dealt a blow to their arrogance .  
By 9 May , the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region had cracked down on 3,286 criminal cases , crushed 49 criminal gangs involving secret societies and evil forces , and pronounced mass judgments on 221 cases of gross violence and 326 criminals .  
In a special campaign to " crack down on secret societies and eliminate evil forces , " the autonomous region destroyed 49 criminal gangs involving secret societies and evil forces , arrested 232 core gang members , cracked 454 criminal cases and seized 11 firearms of various types .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
The factors that have enabled triad-related and evil forces to survive and expand over a long period of time in the past have also proved a key issue for the concentrated study and analysis of procuratorial organs at all levels in their current case-handling work of examining and rectifying arrests and instituting legal proceedings .  The Supreme People 's Court has stressed that cases involving the " protective umbrellas " of triad-related and evil forces which are reported to the authorities by the masses shall be resolutely investigated and dealt with as key cases .  
During the recent " strike hard " campaign , the provincial procuratorates in a number of provinces , such as Fujian and Hebei , have regarded it the main direction of their work to thoroughly dig out the " protective umbrellas " behind triad-related and evil forces and to handle position-related crimes committed by state functionaries that are intertwined with economic crimes ; and have intensified the investigation and prosecution of position-related crimes .  
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government leaders , including Jia Qinglin , fully reaffirmed the public security organs ' special campaigns and public order rectification work that mainly aimed to crack down on criminal underworld and evil elements , and that also aimed to severely crack down on serious violent crimes , repeated financial crimes , neighborhood crimes , and drug-related crimes .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
In quite a few rural areas in Shanxi Province , there still exist the difficulties in traveling , getting drinking water , going to school , seeing a doctor , and so on at present .  In some villages , the leading groups are still in a state of " weakness , slackness , and paralysis " , and in other villages , the clan forces are interfering with village affairs , local ruffians , tyrants , and other evil forces are rampant , and the situation of public order is very grim .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
If country markets are not regulated , restructured , and strictly controlled , they will become the collection and distribution centers for fake and inferior quality products ; " special zones " for tax fraud and tax evasion ; and places for sheltering evil people and upholding evil practices , thus becoming the cancer that undermines the market economic order .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
" Shanghai Five " has played an important role in abolishing border military confrontation among the member states , building up military trust , resolving the border leftover problems , jointly preventing multinational criminal activities , controlling drug and arms smuggling and jointly cracking down on the international evil forces ever since its founding five years ago .  These engagements have become the reason and the strength for the existence of " Shanghai Five " and for the consolidation of its mechanism .  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " was aimed at effectively , completely and accurately practicing Deng Xiaoping Theory so that all issues in every sector and every corner of the society we live in are healthy and advanced , so that all negative , corrupt and evil issues will be minimized , and so that the overwhelming majority of the masses can genuinely feel that , throughout the vast territory of China , the Communist Party is good indeed !  
Ferreting out the " protective umbrella " of underworld and evil forces should be perceived as a major content of the current drive of investigating and handling on-the-job crimes , as an emphasis of the work in deeply promoting the anti-corruption campaign , and as an important content of the work in examining and approving the arrests of criminals and in examining lawsuits .  No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .  
After the launch of the " strike hard " campaign , public security organs in Hebei , Jiangxi , Guizhou , Hunan , and Sichuan , under the strong leadership of the various levels of party committees and governments , have overcome many difficulties , adopted firm measures , destroyed a number of organized crime groups , and arrested a large number of criminals who seriously undermined public order and who committed many evil deeds .  
This horrifying incident and brutal tragedy has once again thoroughly unmasked the ugly face of Li Hongzhi and his so called " the true , the good , and the tolerant , " and has further laid bare to the world the ugly and inhumane nature of the " Falungong " as an evil cult that harms life .  
In fact , progressive figures in Japanese society have consistently exposed the reactionary essence of the Yasukuni Shrine , and the families of some of the " war dead " who clearly understand the essence of the evil of the war have also expressed that their dear ones were victims misled by the spirit of the Yasukuni Shrine , and some of these people have taken part in recent street processions opposing Koizumi 's paying respects there .  
We have gathered a lot of female " Falungong " practitioners who disturbed social order and through our help , most of them have realized Li Hongzhi 's true colors and " Falungong 's " evil nature .  Consequently , Masanjia Reeducation Center has become the most prominent target that has been attacked and slandered by Li Hongzhi and his gang .  
However , through the sudden change in the world history , the Taiwan authorities only caught sight of splittism and the " strategically favorable chance " of " creating another China . " As a result , the dregs under the Taiwan Strait were floating and the evil wind was blowing over the strait , thus turning the destiny of one China into a political magic and turning the ever-improving cross-strait relations since 1992 into ones " without agreements . "  
Wei Ruixing pointed out : The Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " evil cult in accordance with law , and punished a very small number of the cult-related criminals who have brought about serious harm to society .  The Chinese Government has protected the human rights and freedom of the broad masses of the people in China , and safeguarded the stability of social order as a result .  The practice has won support from the broad masses of the Chinese citizens , and is completely legal and rightful .  
it is imbued with the intentions of the central authorities on governing the party with strictness and opposing corruption ; depicts a noble and healthy atmosphere of contemporary communists building a party serving the interests of the people and not being cowed by evil ; and expresses our party 's strong resolve to oppose corruption .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
Confusing right and wrong , some policemen harbored criminal offenders and were even indulgent with criminals .  Some policemen even served as protective umbrellas for evildoers and some directly engaged in smuggling and shielded smugglers ; as a result , the evil phenomena of pornography , gambling , and drugs still survive despite repeated crackdowns .  
Such action in ignoring the sovereignty of the Chinese Catholic Church and doing things in perfunctory fashion is shocking .  The procedure for this canonization was chaotic , and many of the candidates committed evil , while the timing of the canonization was chosen as the day symbolizing the Chinese people 's total emancipation from imperialist and colonialist aggression and plunder and their liberation ; this is a public insult and contempt for the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church , and we absolutely can not tolerate and accept this .  
The evil nature of these cults determines their fanatical , cruel , and destructive behavior patterns and also determines that the violent and terrorist activities of cults are more cruel , crazy , and horrible than those general social violent incidents .  
They even jointly brought a lawsuit against him .  After accepting the case , the Qing government had Liu arrested on 13 November 1647 ( the fourth year of the reign of Shunzhi ) for " engaging in the preaching of evil ways , hoodwinking good and innocent people , professing to observe celibacy while actually abducting women and leading a fast and shameless life , even committing adultery with a widow out of town , who later gave birth to a girl . "  He was executed in 1648 .  
The Ma Lai incident shows that during the 19th century Catholic missionaries took advantage of the imperialist gunboat policy to do all kinds of evil things in China , bully the Chinese people , cause incidents , and act as foot soldiers in scheming war against China , after which the western powers used the " missionary case " to launch a war of aggression against China and force it to sign an unequal treaty .  
However , their moves met with strong opposition from the local overseas Chinese students , ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese nationals , who wrote to the press , denouncing their perverse and evil preaching and exposing their tricks in hoodwinking the public as well as the despicable deeds of the " Falungong " members who robbed people in the streets because they were possessed by the devil , thus laying bear the true features of the " Falungong " as a cult .  
The " Falungong " and other cults worship their founders in a big way and cook up false reasoning and heresies to profane human dignity , to jeopardize social stability , and to hoodwink the good and honest masses in an attempt to achieve their evil , ulterior , anti-human , anti-social , and anti-science purposes .  
For one reason or another , however , underworld evil forces are still developing and spreading in some localities in these years , and they are swollen with arrogance .  Where such forces are rampant , people dare not report to the authorities the crimes committed by these forces and make complaints about their sufferings .  Now , underworld evil forces of one kind or another have gravely jeopardized the safety of our people 's life and property and seriously disrupted our socialist market economy and social order .  
Although the forms of expression and the numbers of people involved in criminal and evil forces vary between the coastal areas and the interior and between town and country , and some organizations are lax and some tight , their antisocial essence is completely identical and they do very great social harm .  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
With regard to the current serious state of activities committed by criminal and evil forces , the leading central comrades have given important instructions on many occasions specifically demanding that the public security organs crack down severely according to law to totally eliminate the evil ;  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
He praised the Macao SAR Government , saying that " the SAR Government headed by Mr . Ho Hau-wah has forged ahead in pragmatic fashion and led the residents to overcome various difficulties ; a great deal of encouraging new atmosphere has emerged in Macao " ; " the SAR Government has effectively cracked down on various evil forces , public order has markedly improved , and the economic situation has consequently taken a turn for the better . "  
Ever since the Ministry of Public Security drew up plans to launch a special struggle against " triads and evil forces " on a nationwide scale , many localities , by launching powerful operations , have succeeded in destroying a number of triad societies and evil forces , cracking a number of major and important cases , and imposing severe punishments upon a number of criminals of triad societies and evil forces .  The people have clapped and cheered with great satisfaction .  
Public security organs at all levels should conscientiously enhance their sense of political responsibility and , with the spirit of being highly responsible for the party , people , and law , make further efforts to unify their ideas , inspire themselves with enthusiasm , adopt stronger measures , strike out with a powerful force , and firmly crack down on triads and evil forces to enable the people to enjoy a safe , happy , and peaceful Spring Festival and lay a good foundation for the work of public order in the whole year .  
The special struggle arranged by the Ministry of Public Security against criminal syndicates and evil forces has produced initial success ; we must unremittingly pay close attention to it to completely root out criminal syndicates and evil forces in all localities .  In particular , we must resolutely crack down on their " protective umbrellas " and severely punish according to law whoever is involved .  
The Chinese Government , pursuant to the relevant law , bans and cracks down on the evil cult Falungong exactly for the purpose of protecting the citizens ' basic rights and freedom .  This is firmly supported and upheld by the people throughout the country and is also extensively understood by the international community .  
Zhu Bangzao continued : The US State Department spokesman , ignoring the facts and juggling black and white , made irresponsible remarks and a groundless allegation on the Chinese Government 's lawful handling of the evil cult Falungong . This is entirely unacceptable to the Chinese side .  
Li Hongzhi , however , who has thrown in his lot with western anti-China forces , has refused to give up his evil designs ; he has repeatedly disseminated his fallacies of " ascend to heaven on consummation , " " go beyond forbearance , " and " cause blood to flow , " and hoodwinked and incited " Falungong " diehards who are mentally controlled by him to make a reckless move , not even stinting to being content that " Falungong " addicts should die in order to reach his unspeakable political goals .  
The CYL organizations at all levels should be fully aware that opposing " Falungong " is a long-term , intense , and complicated struggle , which is also , in essence , a serious political struggle ; should extensively mobilize or unite the broad masses of the CYL members or youth to wage a firm and thorough struggle against " Falungong , " which is an evil cult ; should play a role as a vital new force in a struggle aimed at exposing or repudiating " Falungong " as an evil cult ;  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
The vast number of Taiwan compatriots are also opposed to the evil cult of " Falungong . " Compatriots on both sides of the straits should unite in resolutely struggling against the sinister attempt of the Taiwan authorities and other separatist forces by supporting " Falungong , " thus safeguarding the stable and healthy development of cross-strait relations .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
The self-immolation incident created by several obsessed " Falungong " practitioners on the eve of the Chinese New Year at Tiananmen Square shocked people in all circles and aroused righteous resentment .  People in the overseas Chinese affairs circles today held a meeting to strongly condemn the " Falungong " evil cult 's crime of inhumanely trampling upon human lives .  
He pointed out : Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " evil cult have become a political tool of the Western anti-China forces .  To achieve their sinister political purpose , they spread fallacies to hoodwink the public again and again , instigated diehard " Falungong " members to incite mob disturbances again and again .  Now , they even took more desperate actions and went as far as driving obsessed followers to commit suicide .  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .  While doing a good job in educating and transforming obsessed " Falungong " followers , it is also necessary to resolutely punish diehard members of the evil cult according to the laws .  
Everyone pointed out that the people 's army is the loyal protector of the people 's interests , that we must take the lead to implement and propagate the spiritual civilization of socialism , to study , discuss and practice science , to spread advanced civilization , to criticize the superstitions of evil religion , and to further tackle every task in order to provide a dependable assurances of security in realizing the magnificent goals planned by the 15th National People 's Congress .  
People attending the forum were all filled with righteous indignation at the tragic incident which shocked all people inside and outside China , and pointed out that the incident once again fully exposed the out-and-out evil cult nature of " Falungong . "  
People speaking at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square thoroughly exposed the nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult that causes disasters to the nation and the people and the fact that " Falungong " has become a tool of the international anti-China forces .  The struggle against " Falungong " is a major issue of cardinal principles and is related to social peace and stability and the people 's well-being .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
She Mengiao , secretary of the party group and executive vice chairman of the China Law Society , called at the meeting on jurists and lawyers around the country to gain a complete understanding of the evil nature of " Falungong " and make full use of the legal weapons in their hands to crack down on criminal activities carried out by the " Falungong " cult organization and educate and redeem stubborn " Falungong " members so as to remove the social cancer , making their due contributions .  
They are genuine evil creatures committing monstrous crimes .  Former Falungong practitioner Zhang Kuilin said that the collective self-immolation incident which occurred in Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve is a bloody fact and a heinous crime committed by Li Hongzhi and his Falungong cult against mankind and China .  
The French evil cults are also strongly fraudulent in nature , for they often recruit followers from among unemployed or frustrated people , by rescuing the small or saving the weak , by assisting the lonely or helping the handicapped , and by pumping funds into bankrupt companies as well .  
Over the past 20-odd years , various anticult institutions of the French Parliament and the French Government have published five specialized reports on evil cults , which have analyzed the situation of evil cults in France in a comprehensive , systematic , and in-depth way , and this has on the one hand played a key role in ensuring a consensus within the government on the issue of launching a ruthless crackdown on evil cults and has provided a strong basis for the government to take countermeasures on the other .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
Apart from confusing people with heresy , exercising mental control , deifying the leader , forming secret societies , illegally extorting money , and acting in hostile fashion against society , there is also a notable characteristic in the evil of cults , that is , they cripple people 's lives by inveigling their addicts into adopting extreme methods such as mass suicide .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .  
Writers participating in the forum appealed to the vast number of writers and literary workers in all parts of the country to swing into action , further recognize the essence of the evil cult and its serious harm to society , work hard to create literary works in support of the on-going major struggle , vividly expose and castigate the sinister feature of Falungong for the broad masses , educate the people and make them recognize the cult feature of Falungong , and make due contributions to the struggle against the cult .  
By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .  
The serious social fact that evil cults appear in the late 20th century , to a certain degree , was caused by the frequent abuse of the concept of " religious freedom " by some people with ulterior motives .  " Freedom of religious belief " has been used by some evil forces as a shield and " protective talisman " as a way to spread their influence and get away with it .  
He said , since the use of the term " religious freedom " may provide certain conducive social ideological and legal room for the development of evil cults to a certain degree , then why ca n't the international cooperation mechanisms against evil cults find a substitute term to reduce such misunderstanding and distortion ?  
The flames burning those obsessed with " Falungong , " who had set themselves on fire , have also burnt down a mask Li Hongzhi has worn , namely , " the true , the good , and the tolerant " ; have woken up quite a few " lambs that have gone astray " ; and have brought to light such a truth as well : Should we fail to weed out this evil cult , there would be no stability in our country and no security for our people .  
Many facts show that " Falungong " has all major features of a modern evil cult .  What it did seriously harmed the physical and mental health of the practitioners , infringed upon the interests of the masses , and gravely disrupted our country 's economic construction , social order , and political stability .  
They embody the spirit of being highly responsible to the cause of the party and the people , the spirit of faithfully performing duties and making selfless dedications , the humanitarian spirit of being friendly toward people and being patient in helping people being obsessed and misled by the evil cult , the spirit of defending science and upholding the truth , the spirit of fearing no difficulty and daring to undertaking difficult tasks , and the spirit of being responsible and doing down-to-earth work .  
The General Headquarters of Staff , the General Political Department , the General Logistics Department , the General Equipment Department , and all major units studied the concrete methods of education and made careful arrangements in connection with the conditions of the troops , organized theoretical workers to deeply analyze the anti-science , anti-human , anti-society , anti-government reactionary character of the " Falungong " evil cult and provided theoretical guidance to the education activities among the troops .  All units also dispatched elite forces to guide the troops to carry out education and implement the plans .  
In the education activities , all units held meetings and lectures to denounce and expose the evil cult and eradicate the malignant tumor in society .  With a large quantity of vivid facts , the troops angrily denounced the towering crimes committed by " Falungong , " and clearly realized that " Falungong " did not really pursue " truth , benevolence , tolerance " as it advocated , but just did inhumane and ruthless things .  
Meanwhile , in line with the unified work arrangements of the central authorities , procuratorial organs at all levels gave an active play to their functions and roles in the campaign of " cracking down on underworld triads and wiping out evil forces . "  As of the end of January this year , they had approved the arrests of over 1,500 people suspected of involvement in crimes organized by underworld triad forces , and meted out severe legal punishments to a batch of criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes .  
He pointed out that for some time in the recent past , triad gangs and evil forces played the bully and engaged in all sorts of evil in their locality .  They committed manslaughter and robbery and caused bodily harm to the innocent .  Some of them bought over party and government cadres and law-enforcement officials to serve as their " protective umbrella " and posed a serious threat to the personal safety and property of the masses .  
During the discussion , Deputy Gyaincain Norbu and Deputy Li Guohua said : Over the past year , the " two supremes " have played a vital role in cracking down in accordance with the law on " Falungong , " which is an evil cult , in training personnel involved in the political and legal work in western regions , in striking at ethnic separatists , and other aspects , and have stepped up self-building as well .  
Apart from the above , more efforts should be devoted to improving the public order by taking comprehensive measures , punishing by law all kinds of criminal activities that endanger our social and national security , and banning " Falungong " and other evil cults in accordance with law so as to further ensure our social stability .  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
In the second century AD , the first legendary celestial master , Chang Tao-ling , organized the Taoist religion into a formal system . He added mysterious cults including tien ting ( imperial court ) , chu hsieh ( banishing evil ) , chang sheng ( longevity ) and cheng hsien ( immortality ) to the original ideology .  
Due to the animal 's ferocity , people born under its sign are sometimes the objects of taboo on festive or congratulatory occasions . But as the Chinese " king of beasts , " the tiger also represents an abundance of vitality , presaging great undertakings and accomplishments , and is credited with the ability to ward off calamity and evil spirits .  
Its characteristic vice was also its greatest virtue : because it devoured anything it came upon , even evil spirits avoided it , and the Chinese considered it auspicious . Its fearsome features often appear on ancient bronze or ceramic dining vessels - - as a warning against overindulgence as well as a charm against evil .  
Wang says that all Chinese lions - - be they small-scale figures for utilitarian decoration or imposing statues designed to guard against evil - - can generally be classified into one of two styles , a northern and a southern . The northern lion is majestic and awesome , while the southern lion is warmer and gentler and often reveals a smile .  
After all , perhaps , lay people 's belief in Buddhism and Buddhist worship may stem from a worldly viewpoint of bringing them tangible success . They seek support from the bodhisattvas ' spiritual power to guard them against evil , but they fail to cultivate inner awareness or attain the inner tranquility and joy that come from dispelling selfish attachments and external concerns about fortune or misfortune . In contrast to Manjusri with his metaphysical ideas of prajna wisdom , Samantabhadra and his message of " great action " exemplifies a much more concrete aspect of Buddhism .  
Along the path , the " Eight Family Generals , " with colorfully painted faces , straw shoes , and with the implements of worship in hand , are responsible for sweeping away evil and demons and protecting the divine entourage . The Centipede chen and the Golden Lion chen , with similarly divine capabilities , take the left and right points , clearing a path for Wang Tieh . As noon approaches , the hot sun pounds on the processionists .  
Even more interesting is that the Jade Emperor lived long inside the celestial palace , and became rather detached from the conditions of men . Thus every year on the 24th day of the twelfth month on the lunar calender , all the deities who had been sent among men had to return to the court , and report on the beneficence and evil of each human ; they could only return among the people on the fourth day of the first month in the next year .  
However there is the case of Taiwan 's only Hakka Bullfight team located in Wanluan Rural Township : While there is nothing unique about the content of their performances , after the bamboo bovine has finished in the temple , he must pass inspection from the temple Master who attaches an amulet before the animal is allowed to leave ; this adds the function of expelling evil .  
Some , holding that the many items relating to satellite communication technology involved national defense facilities , harbored suspicions that the Chinese communists had " evil intentions . " While economically there might be some small profits to be made , they feared that the national defense would be seriously damaged . Others thought that mainland research that had led to defense technology was far removed from commercial technology that could be profitably sold in the marketplace . They doubted whether Taiwan could use the Chinese communists ' strengths to improve R . O . C . technology .  
At the end a scholar in official mandarin dress and a female character with a powdered face came out and bowed to each other and the audience , thanking them for watching . Only this counts as a full performance . After the evil spirits were expelled and thanks given to the gods , with easy hearts people returned to the normal order of their lives .  
" This is because Taiwan was pioneered from south to north . At first the south was opened up , and with illness rampant in that pioneering period , expelling the evil and clearing away misfortune required strong methods . Thus the more martial and ferocious Master Taitzu and Wang Yeh flourished more , " argues Cheng Chih-ming .  
The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
Probably the most common type of amulet is a lion 's head carved on a wooden panel , hung on the lintel over the front door . Its simple , mottled colors and stern features stand guard over the entrance day and night , keeping evil at bay .  
Come and meet the In-specting King ! " An evil visitor borne by the waves : Each year at the middle of the sixth lunar month Wen Wangyeh , the deity who resides in Yunglung Temple in Tainan , leads the local people out to receive the Inspecting King as this " high official " disembarks on his far-ranging round of inspection , followed by his retinue of abandoned souls .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
Some people have questioned whether this position , exposed on all sides , does not have unfavorable fengshui . But Chen Cheng-shen , an advisor in the office of the presidential spokes man who is well versed in the principles of geomancy , explains that as the center of national power , the Presidential Palace can repulse any evil influence which may approach along the road , while the four streets around the building express its communication with all parts of the land .  
However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
One day she made the mistake of entering the realm of an evil wizard who cast a spell and turned her and her maids into swans . Day after day she led her flock of maid swans in sad wandering through the forest . Only in the deep dark night before dawn did they return to their human forms , and the only way to break the spell was to have a young man show undying love for the princess .  
" It 's hard to say . It may be that only close relatives were buried in the home , while ' evil spirits ' [ such as those killed in war ] might have been buried farther away from dwellings , " posits Liu . He adds , " Modern people always feel that people from the distant past were ' uncivilized . ' In fact , in terms of life rituals , it may very well be that they were more rigorous and clear-cut than moderns . "  
The stretch of highway known as Death Road , for its frequent fatal accidents , was laid out with many blind corners , but the popular account says that ghosts along that road are seeking souls to substitute for themselves . Physical sickness is explained as the result of contamination by something " unclean , " while all sorts of general problems are ascribed to the rousing of " evil demons . " Attaching every phenomenon to ghosts in this way does of course raise doubts .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
Not only impressionable schoolchildren were confused : from the many views expressed in street gossip on the subject , it was apparent that even in the adult world there was a sudden crisis of confidence in the distinction between " good " and " evil . "  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Although there is an impressive number of lions on display , the museum is unable to ascribe an accurate date and place of origin to each pair . For the time being , it is only able to group them into rough categories . For instance , Southern Fujianese lions from Hui'an and from Tong'an near Quanzhou are placed together , and the shigandang , which have their origins in belief in stone spirits , are placed alongside the wind lion lords which protect their owners from ravaging " evil " winds on small southern islands .  
In the early years of the Republic of China , with constant fighting among the warlords , intellectuals wrote martial arts novels to amuse themselves , and magazine stories grew more and more decadent and extravagant , leading Lu Xun to describe them as " monstrous and evil at heart , and filled with descriptions of romance . " These works invited their urban readers to escape the painful realities of their lives .  
From Arabic literature 's Aladdin to the native American tale of Pocahontas , from The Hunchback of Notre Dame , steeped in Gallic ambience , to Hercules , rooted in Greek and Roman mythology , Disney has long sought out material with a world-wide appeal . Seeking a feeling of intimacy and a clear delineation between good and evil , their animated features employ fables and animals to dissolve the cultural barriers that lie hidden under their auras of exoticism .  
These would then be displayed in front of the home to ward off bad fortune and evil spirits . The people of ancient Japan would also gather medicinal herbs to prevent illness . These customs remain alive today . The Japanese have a May 5th custom of eating kashiwamochi ( rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves ) and soaking in a hot tub or hot spring filled with iris leaves .  
Inside the main door is a Guan Gong statue niche decorated with embroidered cloth . In front is an altar for offerings , and votive items are lined up on it . In front of the altar , on a red background using gold thread , is a table-wrap depicting two dragons playing with pearls , two phoenixes flying toward the sun and a hanging embroidered with the words " support righteousness and destroy evil . "  
Every traditional culture in the world has magic amulets ( geometric shapes , bones , insects or animals ) that bring good luck , ward off evil , or affect the physical or mental condition of other people , or that even , with the appropriate incantations , put you online to the supernatural world .  
When Wang Yeh circulated through the narrow lanes and alleyways of the town , doors were sealed and lights were extinguished in all houses along the route . The only illumination came from the lanterns of the inspection party . The songcaoren ritual for expelling evil , conducted just before the end of the inspection tour , was even more fearsome . Many legends surround bad things that happened to people who did n't get out of the way in time and were subject to the same terrifying forces that were called up to deal with demons .  
" She successfully captured the mysteriousness of weird folk tales , and threw in a lot of stuff about ghosts-Ghost Festival ceremonies , the wandering of lonely ghosts without living descendants , and the mischief committed by evil spirits , " writes the critic Wen Tien-hsiang . " She showed how a small boy would identify with his grandmother and all the traditions and tolerance that she symbolizes , and from there went on to develop an atmosphere of equality and mutual respect between the natural and the supernatural , and between the living and ghosts .  
" There are some battered foreign brides who loathe Taiwanese and think all Taiwanese are evil , and even distrust the social workers themselves , " says Vietnamese-born Sister Mei of the Good Shepherd Sisters . Current law stipulates that even foreign brides who have legal residence must return home if they get divorced , without the possibility of taking their children with them . This last point is very difficult to bear and they frequently feel the social workers are unwilling to help them .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that this tragic incident must not be used for ethically unacceptable and inappropriate political manipulations that espouse the myth that all the sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be seen in the same criminal light and as having the same responsibility for the evil that has engulfed my country for more than three years .  
We are taking stock of negative , devastating and genocide effects of sanctions on the health of the people of Yugoslavia and demonstrate in an expert way , corroborated by arguments , to what extent the sanctions have held us back in the implementation of the health care of the population , how much damage , pain and evil was inflicted and how many innocent lives were cut off as a result .  
Structurally , racial discrimination through denial takes on insidious and subtle forms , and subsists as a vicious circle that only political will based on a clear and courageous facing of reality can break , by attacking the evil .  
Structurally , racial discrimination through denial takes on insidious and subtle forms , and subsists as a vicious circle that only political will based on a clear and courageous facing of reality can break , by attacking the evil .  
If certain reforms are necessary , we should remember that our sole task is to ensure that the United Nations becomes the most efficient , flexible , transparent and suitable instrument to serve humanity when it is in danger or suffering , to prevent evil or to free humanity from evil when evil is upon it .  
Illicit drugs were not a great social problem in his country , but it recognized their evil effects , and had therefore taken part in relevant international and regional conferences , and had signed bilateral agreements and international conventions .  
People are being denied their basic rights ; their houses , shops , mosques , churches and synagogues are burned to the ground ; they are beaten up , maimed and even killed ; and all this in the name of an evil we call racism , which does not leave its victims alone even after they die : the number of cemeteries that are being desecrated is growing at a worrisome pace .  
We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
Considering corruption to be an extreme evil and a serious obstacle to the development of a healthy democracy , the Albanian Parliament and Government have adopted tough legislative and administrative measures to deal with it , establishing specific structures to better uncover and punish abuse of power in certain corrupt sectors of the administration and the judiciary .  
To come together in order to counter the evil role played by diamonds in armed conflict is an excellent , irreproachable initiative , because this illicit trade is prejudicial to peace , particularly in Africa .  
Having been the victims of antipersonnel mines planted by the forces of colonial Powers , Eritreans are aware of the grief and suffering caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of these evil weapons .  
Women and children become vulnerable to trafficking because of social inequality and the vast economic disparity within States and between rich and poor States , even though considerable efforts have gone into standardsetting to combat this evil .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
Only those who are brainwashed enough to believe that ends justify means are capable of regarding a total of more than 230 armed attacks killing 70 innocent people , including 31 Turkish diplomats , and wounding 524 civilians as individual acts ; and only those , I would like to add , can claim such unabashed defence of evil .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Immediately after this , corrupt and immoral people stopped their evil practice , the " court was shocked , and those treacherous and cunning held their breath " .  Even Fu Jian admired the great benefit such management had brought about .  
Zhang Shiming , who has been engaged in long-term research on innovative utilization of straw , believes that it is still necessary at present to accelerate the implementation of strengthening the country through science and education , the development of science , and increasing the scientific level of the entire nation .  In this way , it will enable the broad masses of the people to enhance their abilities to ward off the disturbance and destruction caused by the evil cult organization of " Falungong " .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .  It is also a vigorous test for the public security organs : in order to crack down , first the problem has to be faced squarely , the " protective umbrella " for the dark and evil forces has to be uncovered , and the intertwining network of connections has to be destroyed ;  
We have to clearly recognize that the reason why the dark and evil forces can be so rampant in some localities is exactly because extremely few public security personnel or even government officials are acting as their " protective umbrella . "  This is an important factor which can not be overlooked in the struggle of " hitting the mob and eliminating devils " .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi . They had lost their sense of reasoning as normal human beings when they turned their backs on their loved ones , their family , their school and the normal society .  
Compared with the Yuanhua case , the Chaoshan tax fraud case involves not only huge sums but also evil methods ; the corrupt officials " united as one to cheat the old CPC " and " worked with concerted efforts to plunder the state treasury , " and in addition the methods they used were that of " white wolves with empty gloves " and they directly plundered more than RMB 100-billion from the state treasury by fraudulent means .  
Korea 's ruling party and opposition parties also issued a statement specifically saying that they unanimously and strongly blamed Japan for planning to pass this history textbook , and achieving the evil goal of twisting history and whitewashing their past barbaric behavior towards Asian people .  They also demanded that the Korean government marshall all its forces to take a decisive counteraction toward Japan .  
Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
In this special fight against the evil forces , local authorities , party and government departments , and law enforcement authorities at all levels must work with one mind and with firm resolve .  While we must take quick , thunderbolt-like actions to rebuff the brazenness of the evil forces , we must also take thorough and careful moves to smash the protective shelters that harbor these evil forces so as to completely destroy their structures and cut their poisonous vines in our society .  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
It was not long before China 's underworld organizations and evil forces rapidly spread and become rampant throughout the country .  They have seriously endangered the people 's life , infringed upon their property , undermined their security and threatened the political , economic , and social stability of the country .  
The criminal syndicates and evil forces often use unscrupulous tactics to collect illegitimate wealth and frantically seek profits .  They use the syndicate to protect businesses , while letting the businesses " feed " the " syndicate . "  They have seriously disrupted the economic order of the state and hampered the reform and opening-up program and the smooth development of the socialist modernization drive .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .  
We must introduce more excellent ideological and artistic work , encourage better scenes that are positive and forward-looking as well as healthy and beneficial , and produce more good literary writings that are to the point and clear , as well as drive out evil and usher in good .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
Those who are unjust will definitely reap their own evil fruits .  Just as stated by Western mass media : US losses in the elections reflected " what it deserved " and " a price it must pay " for its foreign policy .  The United States has lifted a rock to drop it onto its own feet .  
In the full-scale armed rebellion started by Dalai to maintain the " wonderful " feudal serfdom , as they claimed , the rebels headed by Dalai , under the banners of " safeguarding religion " and " protecting national interests , " split the motherland , killed compatriots , looted monasteries , blasphemed religion , and raped women , stopping at nothing in doing evil .  
The Hunan Command has altogether spent 1,200 man-times for such tasks as cordoning off the crime scene , armed arrests , armed escorts , and armed patrol in the urban areas in coordination with the local public security organs .  The command has successfully handled a number of cases involving sinister and evil forces that were of relatively wider impact , including the Hengyang " 6 December " incident and the Zhuzhou City " 10 March " arrests and mop-up , capturing 12 criminals , seizing one pistol and 50 bullets .  
According to the incomplete estimates of the departments concerned , at present the armed police units , in coordination with the public security organs , have smashed nearly 1,000 sinister and evil gangs and arrested tens of thousands of criminals .  They have thus demonstrated the strength of the police force and given prominence to what is right .  This has held the sinister and evil forces deeply in awe and dealt a blow to their arrogance .  
By 9 May , the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region had cracked down on 3,286 criminal cases , crushed 49 criminal gangs involving secret societies and evil forces , and pronounced mass judgments on 221 cases of gross violence and 326 criminals .  
In a special campaign to " crack down on secret societies and eliminate evil forces , " the autonomous region destroyed 49 criminal gangs involving secret societies and evil forces , arrested 232 core gang members , cracked 454 criminal cases and seized 11 firearms of various types .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
The factors that have enabled triad-related and evil forces to survive and expand over a long period of time in the past have also proved a key issue for the concentrated study and analysis of procuratorial organs at all levels in their current case-handling work of examining and rectifying arrests and instituting legal proceedings .  The Supreme People 's Court has stressed that cases involving the " protective umbrellas " of triad-related and evil forces which are reported to the authorities by the masses shall be resolutely investigated and dealt with as key cases .  
During the recent " strike hard " campaign , the provincial procuratorates in a number of provinces , such as Fujian and Hebei , have regarded it the main direction of their work to thoroughly dig out the " protective umbrellas " behind triad-related and evil forces and to handle position-related crimes committed by state functionaries that are intertwined with economic crimes ; and have intensified the investigation and prosecution of position-related crimes .  
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government leaders , including Jia Qinglin , fully reaffirmed the public security organs ' special campaigns and public order rectification work that mainly aimed to crack down on criminal underworld and evil elements , and that also aimed to severely crack down on serious violent crimes , repeated financial crimes , neighborhood crimes , and drug-related crimes .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
In quite a few rural areas in Shanxi Province , there still exist the difficulties in traveling , getting drinking water , going to school , seeing a doctor , and so on at present .  In some villages , the leading groups are still in a state of " weakness , slackness , and paralysis " , and in other villages , the clan forces are interfering with village affairs , local ruffians , tyrants , and other evil forces are rampant , and the situation of public order is very grim .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
If country markets are not regulated , restructured , and strictly controlled , they will become the collection and distribution centers for fake and inferior quality products ; " special zones " for tax fraud and tax evasion ; and places for sheltering evil people and upholding evil practices , thus becoming the cancer that undermines the market economic order .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
" Shanghai Five " has played an important role in abolishing border military confrontation among the member states , building up military trust , resolving the border leftover problems , jointly preventing multinational criminal activities , controlling drug and arms smuggling and jointly cracking down on the international evil forces ever since its founding five years ago .  These engagements have become the reason and the strength for the existence of " Shanghai Five " and for the consolidation of its mechanism .  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " was aimed at effectively , completely and accurately practicing Deng Xiaoping Theory so that all issues in every sector and every corner of the society we live in are healthy and advanced , so that all negative , corrupt and evil issues will be minimized , and so that the overwhelming majority of the masses can genuinely feel that , throughout the vast territory of China , the Communist Party is good indeed !  
Ferreting out the " protective umbrella " of underworld and evil forces should be perceived as a major content of the current drive of investigating and handling on-the-job crimes , as an emphasis of the work in deeply promoting the anti-corruption campaign , and as an important content of the work in examining and approving the arrests of criminals and in examining lawsuits .  No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .  
After the launch of the " strike hard " campaign , public security organs in Hebei , Jiangxi , Guizhou , Hunan , and Sichuan , under the strong leadership of the various levels of party committees and governments , have overcome many difficulties , adopted firm measures , destroyed a number of organized crime groups , and arrested a large number of criminals who seriously undermined public order and who committed many evil deeds .  
This horrifying incident and brutal tragedy has once again thoroughly unmasked the ugly face of Li Hongzhi and his so called " the true , the good , and the tolerant , " and has further laid bare to the world the ugly and inhumane nature of the " Falungong " as an evil cult that harms life .  
In fact , progressive figures in Japanese society have consistently exposed the reactionary essence of the Yasukuni Shrine , and the families of some of the " war dead " who clearly understand the essence of the evil of the war have also expressed that their dear ones were victims misled by the spirit of the Yasukuni Shrine , and some of these people have taken part in recent street processions opposing Koizumi 's paying respects there .  
We have gathered a lot of female " Falungong " practitioners who disturbed social order and through our help , most of them have realized Li Hongzhi 's true colors and " Falungong 's " evil nature .  Consequently , Masanjia Reeducation Center has become the most prominent target that has been attacked and slandered by Li Hongzhi and his gang .  
However , through the sudden change in the world history , the Taiwan authorities only caught sight of splittism and the " strategically favorable chance " of " creating another China . " As a result , the dregs under the Taiwan Strait were floating and the evil wind was blowing over the strait , thus turning the destiny of one China into a political magic and turning the ever-improving cross-strait relations since 1992 into ones " without agreements . "  
Wei Ruixing pointed out : The Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " evil cult in accordance with law , and punished a very small number of the cult-related criminals who have brought about serious harm to society .  The Chinese Government has protected the human rights and freedom of the broad masses of the people in China , and safeguarded the stability of social order as a result .  The practice has won support from the broad masses of the Chinese citizens , and is completely legal and rightful .  
it is imbued with the intentions of the central authorities on governing the party with strictness and opposing corruption ; depicts a noble and healthy atmosphere of contemporary communists building a party serving the interests of the people and not being cowed by evil ; and expresses our party 's strong resolve to oppose corruption .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
Confusing right and wrong , some policemen harbored criminal offenders and were even indulgent with criminals .  Some policemen even served as protective umbrellas for evildoers and some directly engaged in smuggling and shielded smugglers ; as a result , the evil phenomena of pornography , gambling , and drugs still survive despite repeated crackdowns .  
Such action in ignoring the sovereignty of the Chinese Catholic Church and doing things in perfunctory fashion is shocking .  The procedure for this canonization was chaotic , and many of the candidates committed evil , while the timing of the canonization was chosen as the day symbolizing the Chinese people 's total emancipation from imperialist and colonialist aggression and plunder and their liberation ; this is a public insult and contempt for the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church , and we absolutely can not tolerate and accept this .  
The evil nature of these cults determines their fanatical , cruel , and destructive behavior patterns and also determines that the violent and terrorist activities of cults are more cruel , crazy , and horrible than those general social violent incidents .  
They even jointly brought a lawsuit against him .  After accepting the case , the Qing government had Liu arrested on 13 November 1647 ( the fourth year of the reign of Shunzhi ) for " engaging in the preaching of evil ways , hoodwinking good and innocent people , professing to observe celibacy while actually abducting women and leading a fast and shameless life , even committing adultery with a widow out of town , who later gave birth to a girl . "  He was executed in 1648 .  
The Ma Lai incident shows that during the 19th century Catholic missionaries took advantage of the imperialist gunboat policy to do all kinds of evil things in China , bully the Chinese people , cause incidents , and act as foot soldiers in scheming war against China , after which the western powers used the " missionary case " to launch a war of aggression against China and force it to sign an unequal treaty .  
However , their moves met with strong opposition from the local overseas Chinese students , ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese nationals , who wrote to the press , denouncing their perverse and evil preaching and exposing their tricks in hoodwinking the public as well as the despicable deeds of the " Falungong " members who robbed people in the streets because they were possessed by the devil , thus laying bear the true features of the " Falungong " as a cult .  
The " Falungong " and other cults worship their founders in a big way and cook up false reasoning and heresies to profane human dignity , to jeopardize social stability , and to hoodwink the good and honest masses in an attempt to achieve their evil , ulterior , anti-human , anti-social , and anti-science purposes .  
For one reason or another , however , underworld evil forces are still developing and spreading in some localities in these years , and they are swollen with arrogance .  Where such forces are rampant , people dare not report to the authorities the crimes committed by these forces and make complaints about their sufferings .  Now , underworld evil forces of one kind or another have gravely jeopardized the safety of our people 's life and property and seriously disrupted our socialist market economy and social order .  
Although the forms of expression and the numbers of people involved in criminal and evil forces vary between the coastal areas and the interior and between town and country , and some organizations are lax and some tight , their antisocial essence is completely identical and they do very great social harm .  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
With regard to the current serious state of activities committed by criminal and evil forces , the leading central comrades have given important instructions on many occasions specifically demanding that the public security organs crack down severely according to law to totally eliminate the evil ;  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
He praised the Macao SAR Government , saying that " the SAR Government headed by Mr . Ho Hau-wah has forged ahead in pragmatic fashion and led the residents to overcome various difficulties ; a great deal of encouraging new atmosphere has emerged in Macao " ; " the SAR Government has effectively cracked down on various evil forces , public order has markedly improved , and the economic situation has consequently taken a turn for the better . "  
Ever since the Ministry of Public Security drew up plans to launch a special struggle against " triads and evil forces " on a nationwide scale , many localities , by launching powerful operations , have succeeded in destroying a number of triad societies and evil forces , cracking a number of major and important cases , and imposing severe punishments upon a number of criminals of triad societies and evil forces .  The people have clapped and cheered with great satisfaction .  
Public security organs at all levels should conscientiously enhance their sense of political responsibility and , with the spirit of being highly responsible for the party , people , and law , make further efforts to unify their ideas , inspire themselves with enthusiasm , adopt stronger measures , strike out with a powerful force , and firmly crack down on triads and evil forces to enable the people to enjoy a safe , happy , and peaceful Spring Festival and lay a good foundation for the work of public order in the whole year .  
The special struggle arranged by the Ministry of Public Security against criminal syndicates and evil forces has produced initial success ; we must unremittingly pay close attention to it to completely root out criminal syndicates and evil forces in all localities .  In particular , we must resolutely crack down on their " protective umbrellas " and severely punish according to law whoever is involved .  
The Chinese Government , pursuant to the relevant law , bans and cracks down on the evil cult Falungong exactly for the purpose of protecting the citizens ' basic rights and freedom .  This is firmly supported and upheld by the people throughout the country and is also extensively understood by the international community .  
Zhu Bangzao continued : The US State Department spokesman , ignoring the facts and juggling black and white , made irresponsible remarks and a groundless allegation on the Chinese Government 's lawful handling of the evil cult Falungong . This is entirely unacceptable to the Chinese side .  
Li Hongzhi , however , who has thrown in his lot with western anti-China forces , has refused to give up his evil designs ; he has repeatedly disseminated his fallacies of " ascend to heaven on consummation , " " go beyond forbearance , " and " cause blood to flow , " and hoodwinked and incited " Falungong " diehards who are mentally controlled by him to make a reckless move , not even stinting to being content that " Falungong " addicts should die in order to reach his unspeakable political goals .  
The CYL organizations at all levels should be fully aware that opposing " Falungong " is a long-term , intense , and complicated struggle , which is also , in essence , a serious political struggle ; should extensively mobilize or unite the broad masses of the CYL members or youth to wage a firm and thorough struggle against " Falungong , " which is an evil cult ; should play a role as a vital new force in a struggle aimed at exposing or repudiating " Falungong " as an evil cult ;  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
Charged with a heavy task , the women 's federations or their organizations at all levels should give full scope to the unique superiority of the broad masses of women and families in resisting an evil cult ; should help " Falungong " practitioners free themselves from the spiritual control of the evil cult ideologically , organizationally , and once and for all ; and should help them keep abreast with the pace of the times by enjoying to the full a warm or progressive life brought by science and civilization as well .  
The vast number of Taiwan compatriots are also opposed to the evil cult of " Falungong . " Compatriots on both sides of the straits should unite in resolutely struggling against the sinister attempt of the Taiwan authorities and other separatist forces by supporting " Falungong , " thus safeguarding the stable and healthy development of cross-strait relations .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
The self-immolation incident created by several obsessed " Falungong " practitioners on the eve of the Chinese New Year at Tiananmen Square shocked people in all circles and aroused righteous resentment .  People in the overseas Chinese affairs circles today held a meeting to strongly condemn the " Falungong " evil cult 's crime of inhumanely trampling upon human lives .  
He pointed out : Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " evil cult have become a political tool of the Western anti-China forces .  To achieve their sinister political purpose , they spread fallacies to hoodwink the public again and again , instigated diehard " Falungong " members to incite mob disturbances again and again .  Now , they even took more desperate actions and went as far as driving obsessed followers to commit suicide .  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .  While doing a good job in educating and transforming obsessed " Falungong " followers , it is also necessary to resolutely punish diehard members of the evil cult according to the laws .  
Everyone pointed out that the people 's army is the loyal protector of the people 's interests , that we must take the lead to implement and propagate the spiritual civilization of socialism , to study , discuss and practice science , to spread advanced civilization , to criticize the superstitions of evil religion , and to further tackle every task in order to provide a dependable assurances of security in realizing the magnificent goals planned by the 15th National People 's Congress .  
People attending the forum were all filled with righteous indignation at the tragic incident which shocked all people inside and outside China , and pointed out that the incident once again fully exposed the out-and-out evil cult nature of " Falungong . "  
People speaking at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square thoroughly exposed the nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult that causes disasters to the nation and the people and the fact that " Falungong " has become a tool of the international anti-China forces .  The struggle against " Falungong " is a major issue of cardinal principles and is related to social peace and stability and the people 's well-being .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
She Mengiao , secretary of the party group and executive vice chairman of the China Law Society , called at the meeting on jurists and lawyers around the country to gain a complete understanding of the evil nature of " Falungong " and make full use of the legal weapons in their hands to crack down on criminal activities carried out by the " Falungong " cult organization and educate and redeem stubborn " Falungong " members so as to remove the social cancer , making their due contributions .  
They are genuine evil creatures committing monstrous crimes .  Former Falungong practitioner Zhang Kuilin said that the collective self-immolation incident which occurred in Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve is a bloody fact and a heinous crime committed by Li Hongzhi and his Falungong cult against mankind and China .  
The French evil cults are also strongly fraudulent in nature , for they often recruit followers from among unemployed or frustrated people , by rescuing the small or saving the weak , by assisting the lonely or helping the handicapped , and by pumping funds into bankrupt companies as well .  
Over the past 20-odd years , various anticult institutions of the French Parliament and the French Government have published five specialized reports on evil cults , which have analyzed the situation of evil cults in France in a comprehensive , systematic , and in-depth way , and this has on the one hand played a key role in ensuring a consensus within the government on the issue of launching a ruthless crackdown on evil cults and has provided a strong basis for the government to take countermeasures on the other .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
Apart from confusing people with heresy , exercising mental control , deifying the leader , forming secret societies , illegally extorting money , and acting in hostile fashion against society , there is also a notable characteristic in the evil of cults , that is , they cripple people 's lives by inveigling their addicts into adopting extreme methods such as mass suicide .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .  
Writers participating in the forum appealed to the vast number of writers and literary workers in all parts of the country to swing into action , further recognize the essence of the evil cult and its serious harm to society , work hard to create literary works in support of the on-going major struggle , vividly expose and castigate the sinister feature of Falungong for the broad masses , educate the people and make them recognize the cult feature of Falungong , and make due contributions to the struggle against the cult .  
By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .  
The serious social fact that evil cults appear in the late 20th century , to a certain degree , was caused by the frequent abuse of the concept of " religious freedom " by some people with ulterior motives .  " Freedom of religious belief " has been used by some evil forces as a shield and " protective talisman " as a way to spread their influence and get away with it .  
He said , since the use of the term " religious freedom " may provide certain conducive social ideological and legal room for the development of evil cults to a certain degree , then why ca n't the international cooperation mechanisms against evil cults find a substitute term to reduce such misunderstanding and distortion ?  
The flames burning those obsessed with " Falungong , " who had set themselves on fire , have also burnt down a mask Li Hongzhi has worn , namely , " the true , the good , and the tolerant " ; have woken up quite a few " lambs that have gone astray " ; and have brought to light such a truth as well : Should we fail to weed out this evil cult , there would be no stability in our country and no security for our people .  
Many facts show that " Falungong " has all major features of a modern evil cult .  What it did seriously harmed the physical and mental health of the practitioners , infringed upon the interests of the masses , and gravely disrupted our country 's economic construction , social order , and political stability .  
They embody the spirit of being highly responsible to the cause of the party and the people , the spirit of faithfully performing duties and making selfless dedications , the humanitarian spirit of being friendly toward people and being patient in helping people being obsessed and misled by the evil cult , the spirit of defending science and upholding the truth , the spirit of fearing no difficulty and daring to undertaking difficult tasks , and the spirit of being responsible and doing down-to-earth work .  
The General Headquarters of Staff , the General Political Department , the General Logistics Department , the General Equipment Department , and all major units studied the concrete methods of education and made careful arrangements in connection with the conditions of the troops , organized theoretical workers to deeply analyze the anti-science , anti-human , anti-society , anti-government reactionary character of the " Falungong " evil cult and provided theoretical guidance to the education activities among the troops .  All units also dispatched elite forces to guide the troops to carry out education and implement the plans .  
In the education activities , all units held meetings and lectures to denounce and expose the evil cult and eradicate the malignant tumor in society .  With a large quantity of vivid facts , the troops angrily denounced the towering crimes committed by " Falungong , " and clearly realized that " Falungong " did not really pursue " truth , benevolence , tolerance " as it advocated , but just did inhumane and ruthless things .  
Meanwhile , in line with the unified work arrangements of the central authorities , procuratorial organs at all levels gave an active play to their functions and roles in the campaign of " cracking down on underworld triads and wiping out evil forces . "  As of the end of January this year , they had approved the arrests of over 1,500 people suspected of involvement in crimes organized by underworld triad forces , and meted out severe legal punishments to a batch of criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes .  
He pointed out that for some time in the recent past , triad gangs and evil forces played the bully and engaged in all sorts of evil in their locality .  They committed manslaughter and robbery and caused bodily harm to the innocent .  Some of them bought over party and government cadres and law-enforcement officials to serve as their " protective umbrella " and posed a serious threat to the personal safety and property of the masses .  
During the discussion , Deputy Gyaincain Norbu and Deputy Li Guohua said : Over the past year , the " two supremes " have played a vital role in cracking down in accordance with the law on " Falungong , " which is an evil cult , in training personnel involved in the political and legal work in western regions , in striking at ethnic separatists , and other aspects , and have stepped up self-building as well .  
Apart from the above , more efforts should be devoted to improving the public order by taking comprehensive measures , punishing by law all kinds of criminal activities that endanger our social and national security , and banning " Falungong " and other evil cults in accordance with law so as to further ensure our social stability .  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
In the second century AD , the first legendary celestial master , Chang Tao-ling , organized the Taoist religion into a formal system . He added mysterious cults including tien ting ( imperial court ) , chu hsieh ( banishing evil ) , chang sheng ( longevity ) and cheng hsien ( immortality ) to the original ideology .  
Due to the animal 's ferocity , people born under its sign are sometimes the objects of taboo on festive or congratulatory occasions . But as the Chinese " king of beasts , " the tiger also represents an abundance of vitality , presaging great undertakings and accomplishments , and is credited with the ability to ward off calamity and evil spirits .  
Its characteristic vice was also its greatest virtue : because it devoured anything it came upon , even evil spirits avoided it , and the Chinese considered it auspicious . Its fearsome features often appear on ancient bronze or ceramic dining vessels - - as a warning against overindulgence as well as a charm against evil .  
Wang says that all Chinese lions - - be they small-scale figures for utilitarian decoration or imposing statues designed to guard against evil - - can generally be classified into one of two styles , a northern and a southern . The northern lion is majestic and awesome , while the southern lion is warmer and gentler and often reveals a smile .  
After all , perhaps , lay people 's belief in Buddhism and Buddhist worship may stem from a worldly viewpoint of bringing them tangible success . They seek support from the bodhisattvas ' spiritual power to guard them against evil , but they fail to cultivate inner awareness or attain the inner tranquility and joy that come from dispelling selfish attachments and external concerns about fortune or misfortune . In contrast to Manjusri with his metaphysical ideas of prajna wisdom , Samantabhadra and his message of " great action " exemplifies a much more concrete aspect of Buddhism .  
Along the path , the " Eight Family Generals , " with colorfully painted faces , straw shoes , and with the implements of worship in hand , are responsible for sweeping away evil and demons and protecting the divine entourage . The Centipede chen and the Golden Lion chen , with similarly divine capabilities , take the left and right points , clearing a path for Wang Tieh . As noon approaches , the hot sun pounds on the processionists .  
Even more interesting is that the Jade Emperor lived long inside the celestial palace , and became rather detached from the conditions of men . Thus every year on the 24th day of the twelfth month on the lunar calender , all the deities who had been sent among men had to return to the court , and report on the beneficence and evil of each human ; they could only return among the people on the fourth day of the first month in the next year .  
However there is the case of Taiwan 's only Hakka Bullfight team located in Wanluan Rural Township : While there is nothing unique about the content of their performances , after the bamboo bovine has finished in the temple , he must pass inspection from the temple Master who attaches an amulet before the animal is allowed to leave ; this adds the function of expelling evil .  
Some , holding that the many items relating to satellite communication technology involved national defense facilities , harbored suspicions that the Chinese communists had " evil intentions . " While economically there might be some small profits to be made , they feared that the national defense would be seriously damaged . Others thought that mainland research that had led to defense technology was far removed from commercial technology that could be profitably sold in the marketplace . They doubted whether Taiwan could use the Chinese communists ' strengths to improve R . O . C . technology .  
At the end a scholar in official mandarin dress and a female character with a powdered face came out and bowed to each other and the audience , thanking them for watching . Only this counts as a full performance . After the evil spirits were expelled and thanks given to the gods , with easy hearts people returned to the normal order of their lives .  
" This is because Taiwan was pioneered from south to north . At first the south was opened up , and with illness rampant in that pioneering period , expelling the evil and clearing away misfortune required strong methods . Thus the more martial and ferocious Master Taitzu and Wang Yeh flourished more , " argues Cheng Chih-ming .  
The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
Probably the most common type of amulet is a lion 's head carved on a wooden panel , hung on the lintel over the front door . Its simple , mottled colors and stern features stand guard over the entrance day and night , keeping evil at bay .  
Come and meet the In-specting King ! " An evil visitor borne by the waves : Each year at the middle of the sixth lunar month Wen Wangyeh , the deity who resides in Yunglung Temple in Tainan , leads the local people out to receive the Inspecting King as this " high official " disembarks on his far-ranging round of inspection , followed by his retinue of abandoned souls .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
Some people have questioned whether this position , exposed on all sides , does not have unfavorable fengshui . But Chen Cheng-shen , an advisor in the office of the presidential spokes man who is well versed in the principles of geomancy , explains that as the center of national power , the Presidential Palace can repulse any evil influence which may approach along the road , while the four streets around the building express its communication with all parts of the land .  
However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
One day she made the mistake of entering the realm of an evil wizard who cast a spell and turned her and her maids into swans . Day after day she led her flock of maid swans in sad wandering through the forest . Only in the deep dark night before dawn did they return to their human forms , and the only way to break the spell was to have a young man show undying love for the princess .  
" It 's hard to say . It may be that only close relatives were buried in the home , while ' evil spirits ' [ such as those killed in war ] might have been buried farther away from dwellings , " posits Liu .

For the time being , it is only able to group them into rough categories .

These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide .

We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing .
