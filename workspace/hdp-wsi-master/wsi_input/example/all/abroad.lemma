The degree of wild celebration and emotional reactions by the Chinese both at home and abroad to Beijing 's successful bid as seen on television and in news photos over the past several days is no less than those several major events since the founding of the People 's Republic , say , the successful explosion of the atomic and hydrogen bombs , the launch of a satellite into space , and China winning the first Olympic medal .

The Pachang River incident has produced an unprecedented impact on Taiwan 's politics .

The DPP 's governing performance shows that the authorities have politically gone against the trend of the times and economically triggered a decline or recession ; enterprises , capital , or qualified personnel have kept migrating abroad ; and the mainland has become the third most ideal destination for Taiwan migrants , and this shows that over the past half a year or more , the public has gradually grown disillusioned with the DPP and has seen more clearly that pursuing Taiwan independence is likely to bring a threat to Taiwan 's security .  
He has even advocated the " two-state theory " in disguised form .  This has not only made cross-strait relations more complicated and perilous , but also created chaotic political and economic situations on the island , thereby thwarting the aspirations of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability , and development .

Gao Changli was placed under the " double rules " because he took it upon himself to print quotations from Jiang Zemin ( purported to be distributed to all judicial officials across the country ) in his hometown in Shandong and because he illegally appropriated several Justice Ministry housing units for its public functionaries .

Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .

Despite the presence of its own ban on exploiting Chinese labor , the Manchu government of the Ch'ing dynasty was powerless to enforce it . In 1859 the Anglo-French Expeditionary Force attacked Peking , sacked the Yuan-ming-yuan and forced the Ch'ing government to sign the Treaty of Peking . One of its clauses stated : " . . . Any Chinese subject desirous of taking up employment anywhere under British jurisdiction or elsewhere abroad may contract with a British subject to do so . . . "  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution .

So we have always been alert for investment opportunities abroad , " says Lin . At first , the Malaysian government wanted to rent 200 chia of land to him . " In pingtung [ in southern Taiwan ] , to have a five chia eel farm is already miraculous - - how could we deal with 200 chia ? "

For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear .

Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
Originally many of the Chinese in Singapore were illiterate and had inferiority complexes , which were aggravated by their living in an international port like Singapore where English was paramount . They broke their backs working so their children could study abroad .  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear .

Moreover , in this situation Mei Lanfang had high expectations for his favored youngest son . But owing to the fact that he himself often went abroad to perform , he absorbed some Western influence . He understood that he should use a patient and gradual method to educate his child . Also , unlike the average opera teacher who is always ready to strike his pupil , he never made Mei Baojiu come to detest the pressure and quit .  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey . " It 's like bombing a chicken with napalm , " says the well-informed Chen . Wide-wingspread falcons are extremely fast , and require a huge amount of space , and are completely unsuitable for mountainous Taiwan .  
At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad .

My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association . He thinks this must be an opinion held by some ROC citizens as a result of their own shortcomings - - their lack of poise or inability to communicate with foreign customs officers .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
In the early years , the Japanese sealed off the mountain areas in order to weaken Taiwan 's ability to resist their power , but after detailed exploration by the Japanese government , gold was mined in large quantities from 1897onwards .

At that time it was specially stipulated in the land reform law that the houses of overseas Chinese were acquired through their efforts abroad . Except for those houses that were rented out and definitely involved " exploitation " and which had to undergo " national reform , " the government could not confiscate those houses in which the families of overseas Chinese were living or those rented out which did not exceed 150 square meters .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
Stories from those days record that those Chinese laborers who risked their very lives to work overseas never failed to mail the money they accumulated back home , to improve the lives of their family . When they had the rare opportunity to return and reunite with their families , inevitably they brought some exotic curiosities , as well as tales of what they had seen and heard in the colorful world abroad , bringing smiles to the faces of loved ones .  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition .

When the movie Eat , Drink , Man , Woman by ROC director Ang Lee had its international release recently , audiences in Europe and America were astonished by what they saw . In the picture , Lang Hsiung is a renowned master chef whose feats include killing a live fish with a jab from his chopsticks and inflating a Peking Duck with his mouth . For audiences in Taiwan , impressed with his skill , the only doubt was whether or not it will lead to us being described abroad as " cruel . "  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media .

The 71-year-old Liu has many " firsts in Taiwan dance " to her credit . She was the first to earn a doctorate in dance ; the first to record aboriginal dance ; and the first to go abroad to copy original choreographic notation of ancient Chinese dance , which she then reconstructed and staged . Now in her sixth year since " retiring , " she is still teaching and choreographing non-stop .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
But most of the travelogues which pre-date the late Ming concern travel within China . And although Journey to the West , which describes the Tang dynasty monk Tripitaka 's journey westward to collect Buddhist sutras , recounts a trip which went as far abroad as India , most of the book 's geography is made up . Kung Peng-cheng believes that Journey to the West is indistinguishable from the ancient Chinese idea of a distant journey to seek out a sage .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .

Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
" It did n't matter whether they knew you or not , every day people were coming around the patients ' beds talking about this or that famous doctor , secret cure , medicine , or cancer-related group .

She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park , which was being planned at that time , included provision for bilingual schools and American-style residential communities . This was also the period when diplomatic ties with the US were cut , which aroused resentment in Taiwan and led some Taiwanese abroad to return home as an expression of solidarity .  
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion . Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no-one has to worry about getting everything ready . For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year . A bittersweet evening

It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August .

In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse .

The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
I found the most recent issue of Sinorama , with its reports on the special local character of places like Tungkang , Meinung , Chiaotou , and Linpien , very refreshing . The reports were very touching , and much more thoughtful than the usual tour book blurbs .

At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad .

" At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .

Students need only have their application accepted , and they will be exempted from the normal exams for government scholarships .  
" All told , Taiwan has over 70 free-to-air , cable and satellite TV stations . To put a positive gloss on it you could say this is a sign of a vibrant industry , but with such intense competition , many stations feel that producing drama series of their own is too costly and risky , so they prefer to buy ready-made Japanese , Korean or mainland offerings . With the large influx of drama from abroad , in fact the biggest losers have been Taiwanese film and TV production organizations , " laments Andy Wang .  
At present , he is living with his son , and though he is as poor as before , at least the cultural foundation that his friends at home and abroad cooperatively established provides him with a monthly stipend of NT $ 50,000 for his living expenses .

Lee also expressed the hope that the incident would encourage the people of Taiwan to give more thought to conservation .  
" In addition to shaping and achieving goals , it 's also important to fill people 's bellies , " says Lee . He notes that after Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , local factories moved abroad and unemployment became a serious problem . Consequently , the community development program will only be judged a success if it is able to revive the community and resolve residents ' economic difficulties . With that in mind , the development of distinctive local industries has been an urgent concern .  
A related inscription can still be found near the Fuyu Temple located in the old part of Tanshui .

As sung by Chi Yu , an artist known for her angelic voice , the song immediately made a huge impression both home and abroad , and is considered one of the genuine classics of the folk music era .  
Danger can be divided into two categories : perceived risk and objective risk . Wu Kuan-chang , exploration aficionado and a student in the doctoral program in Leisure Behavior at Indiana University 's Department of Recreation and Park Administration , points out that people 's anxieties about mountaineering and other adventure activities are primarily subjective perceptions of risk . In fact many studies from abroad indicate that the risk of injury while engaging in these kinds of activities is much lower than the risks involved in playing many ball sports .

Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;

This has not only made cross-strait relations more complicated and perilous , but also created chaotic political and economic situations on the island , thereby thwarting the aspirations of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability , and development .

Any Chinese subject desirous of taking up employment anywhere under British jurisdiction or elsewhere abroad may contract with a British subject to do so . . . "

Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "

As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey .

My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association .

Except for those houses that were rented out and definitely involved " exploitation " and which had to undergo " national reform , " the government could not confiscate those houses in which the families of overseas Chinese were living or those rented out which did not exceed 150 square meters .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
Stories from those days record that those Chinese laborers who risked their very lives to work overseas never failed to mail the money they accumulated back home , to improve the lives of their family .

When the movie Eat , Drink , Man , Woman by ROC director Ang Lee had its international release recently , audiences in Europe and America were astonished by what they saw . In the picture , Lang Hsiung is a renowned master chef whose feats include killing a live fish with a jab from his chopsticks and inflating a Peking Duck with his mouth . For audiences in Taiwan , impressed with his skill , the only doubt was whether or not it will lead to us being described abroad as " cruel . "  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election .

While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
But most of the travelogues which pre-date the late Ming concern travel within China . And although Journey to the West , which describes the Tang dynasty monk Tripitaka 's journey westward to collect Buddhist sutras , recounts a trip which went as far abroad as India , most of the book 's geography is made up . Kung Peng-cheng believes that Journey to the West is indistinguishable from the ancient Chinese idea of a distant journey to seek out a sage .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
In 1959 the Chinese communists invaded Tibet , and the Dalai Lama and leading officials fled abroad . They took much valuable jewelry with them , including coral , amber and turquoise , as well as many mysterious dZi beads with their stunning contrasts of white on black .  
Studies abroad suggest that adult sexual problems such as exposure , fetishes , impotence , or premature ejaculation are all related to repression of sexuality in early childhood .

Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
" It did n't matter whether they knew you or not , every day people were coming around the patients ' beds talking about this or that famous doctor , secret cure , medicine , or cancer-related group . There were even people providing channels for directly purchasing medications and inoculations from abroad . " One thing she found especially remarkable was the frequent sight of can after can of some nameless inky black liquid on the bedside tables of patients .  
Eighty to ninety percent of the new performers returning to Taiwan from studies abroad were trained in such classes . " Within the formal educational system , specially arranged art and music laboratory classes provide intensive training to develop artistic talents .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park , which was being planned at that time , included provision for bilingual schools and American-style residential communities . This was also the period when diplomatic ties with the US were cut , which aroused resentment in Taiwan and led some Taiwanese abroad to return home as an expression of solidarity .  
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion . Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no-one has to worry about getting everything ready . For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year . A bittersweet evening  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died .

It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August . He devoted particular attention to the local investment climate in each country , and came up with a few suggestions of his own .  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
I found the most recent issue of Sinorama , with its reports on the special local character of places like Tungkang , Meinung , Chiaotou , and Linpien , very refreshing . The reports were very touching , and much more thoughtful than the usual tour book blurbs . This is the kind of reporting that is really lacking in our society today , and offers a sense of intimacy that Taiwanese readers abroad can really appreciate .  
At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad . To this end , he has organized countless solo and joint exhibits , talked his good friend and printmaker Chu Wei-pai into opening an art gallery , introduced to Taiwan 's art community the works of such expatriate painters as Charng Yuh and Chao Wu-chi , and done many other things to inject renewed life into Taiwan 's arts scene .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .  
As Li Chen-ching explains , the MOE has decided this year to begin a special program for developing short-term researchers in key technology areas . Thirty-five spots will be funded for doctoral candidates recommended by their universities to go abroad to do research in 12 key areas-including nanotechnology , biotechnology , computer science , and microelectronics-for one year . Students need only have their application accepted , and they will be exempted from the normal exams for government scholarships .  
" All told , Taiwan has over 70 free-to-air , cable and satellite TV stations . To put a positive gloss on it you could say this is a sign of a vibrant industry , but with such intense competition , many stations feel that producing drama series of their own is too costly and risky , so they prefer to buy ready-made Japanese , Korean or mainland offerings . With the large influx of drama from abroad , in fact the biggest losers have been Taiwanese film and TV production organizations , " laments Andy Wang .  
At present , he is living with his son , and though he is as poor as before , at least the cultural foundation that his friends at home and abroad cooperatively established provides him with a monthly stipend of NT $ 50,000 for his living expenses . He still makes it back to Taiwan on occasion , residing in the quiet flat he rents in Tamsui .  
In response to questions raised by conservationists both in Taiwan and abroad , COA vice chairman Lee Jen-chyuan stated that this has been a painful experience , and demonstrated that the management of wildlife preserves had to be further improved . Lee also expressed the hope that the incident would encourage the people of Taiwan to give more thought to conservation .  
" In addition to shaping and achieving goals , it 's also important to fill people 's bellies , " says Lee . He notes that after Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , local factories moved abroad and unemployment became a serious problem . Consequently , the community development program will only be judged a success if it is able to revive the community and resolve residents ' economic difficulties . With that in mind , the development of distinctive local industries has been an urgent concern .  
A related inscription can still be found near the Fuyu Temple located in the old part of Tanshui . In order to familiarize people with Taiwan and the Customs Museum , whenever Yeh travels or undertakes on-site study in Taiwan or abroad , he distributes the promotional brochures he carries around , hoping that people will visit alternative historical sites and museums , which are often not on the beaten track . Then they will realize the truth of the saying that " when historic figures have faded away , the city will remain .  
In her first and second years in university she tried to transfer to the department of foreign languages . In her senior year she began taking courses at a supplementary school to prepare for the exam to enter graduate school to study foreign relations . Although she was thwarted in each of these three attempts to advance toward her dream , she is still working hard now to save money to go abroad to approach it from a fresh angle .  
After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds .

As sung by Chi Yu , an artist known for her angelic voice , the song immediately made a huge impression both home and abroad , and is considered one of the genuine classics of the folk music era .  
Danger can be divided into two categories : perceived risk and objective risk . Wu Kuan-chang , exploration aficionado and a student in the doctoral program in Leisure Behavior at Indiana University 's Department of Recreation and Park Administration , points out that people 's anxieties about mountaineering and other adventure activities are primarily subjective perceptions of risk . In fact many studies from abroad indicate that the risk of injury while engaging in these kinds of activities is much lower than the risks involved in playing many ball sports .  
After prices had risen , the number of fish farmers raising tilapia increased . And with a continual stream of orders from abroad , the tilapia industry entered a boom period .

Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;
