By its decision 49 / 413 B of 12 July 1995 , the General Assembly decided that there should be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 805,000 gross ( $ 891,000 net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 , inclusive . 
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
The relative success of the Federation in protecting the international civil servant against gross political interference by one member country did not mean that , overnight , FICSA became a respected interlocutor of the management in the common system organizations .  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .  
stark contrast between the forceful abduction and subsequent torture of a Turkish Cypriot by the Greek Cypriot police and the humane manner in which the above-mentioned Greek Cypriot offender was treated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities , fully in accordance with the legal procedures , illustrates which side in Cyprus respects human rights and the rule of law and which side is responsible for gross violations .  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Also decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 2,618,600 dollars gross ( 2,217,800 dollars net ) for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,966,500 United States dollars gross ( 1,858,600 dollars net ) , for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 378,600 United States dollars gross ( 373,800 dollars net ) for the period from 16 December 1994 to 16 June 1995 ;  
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
At the same time , it was able to ensure political stability , improve security and engineer a rapid economic recovery , as reflected by a strong gross domestic product growth of 7.6 per cent , an inflation rate kept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the national currency throughout 1995 .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
It is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum of $ 30-billion in official development assistance was required in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in African countries over the course of the 1990s .  
It recognizes the efforts of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to incorporate social development into their policies and programmes in a variety of ways and more intensively than in the past , as well as the urgent need for the international community to make efforts to reach as soon as possible the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance .  It also endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 , on new and innovative ideas to generate new funds .  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and increase the share of funding for social development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
It may be recalled that the General Assembly , in its decision 49 / 483 of 12 July 1995 , decided that there would be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 , inclusive .  
With regard to the ICAO investigation , although it is part of the United Nations manoeuvre to bring the incident before the Security Council , we are not afraid of it ; on the contrary , we accept it and we demand that it should be rapid and impartial , and that it should take into account all the background information and the gross provocations we are suffering from as a result of the repeated violation of our airspace and the risks they entailed to air traffic and to our country . 
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever . 
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
In the light of recent and prospective changes in peace-keeping operations , the Secretary-General has undertaken what is described as a comprehensive " bottom-up " review of backstopping requirements at Headquarters and determined that the establishment of 355 posts and a total requirement of $ 37.2-million gross represent the minimum necessary to ensure the backstopping support required for active , completed and closed missions for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 .  
Decides also to appropriate the amount of 4,632,500 dollars gross ( 4,152,200 dollars net ) for the administrative closing of the Assistance Mission for the period subsequent to 19 April 1996 , inclusive of the amount of 50,200 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations , to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution ;  
Decides also to appropriate the amount of 4,632,500 dollars gross ( 4,152,200 dollars net ) for the administrative closing of the Assistance Mission for the period subsequent to 19 April 1996 , inclusive of the amount of 50,200 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations , to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution ;  
Decides further , as an ad hoc and exceptional arrangement , that Member States shall waive their respective shares in the remaining credits arising from previous budgets of the United Nations Protection Force in an amount of 8,455,336 dollars gross ( 8,601,911 dollars net ) , to be transferred to the Special Account for the International Tribunal from the Special Account for the United Nations Protection Force established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 233 of 19 March 1992 ;  
With regard to the new programming period , starting 1997 , the Administrator proposes that the basic principles of the waiver system be maintained on the understanding that the waiver bands and the base year for per capita gross national product ( GNP ) data are adjusted in line with Executive Board decision 95 / 23 on successor programming arrangements .  These changes are reflected below and will apply to the second year of the 1996-1997 biennial budget .  
Performance generally reflected strong growth in tourism and in offshore financial services , as well as increased domestic investment , with the gross domestic product recorded at US $ 90.2-million .  
From 1973 to 1992 , the total official development assistance for all developing countries registered a remarkable stability ranging from 0.32 per cent to 0.34 per cent of donor gross national product .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
In Israel , for example , members of the national trade union organization , Histadrut , which includes 85 per cent of wage-earners , are simultaneously owners and members of a parallel system of cooperative business enterprises active in most economic sectors ; in aggregate , they account for 25 per cent of the gross national product .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
The General Assembly should reaffirm the importance of striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance and endorse the need to increase the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals set out in commitment 2 , relating to the eradication of poverty , of the Copenhagen Declaration and chapter 2 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit .  
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
Phase 1 contains basic gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices , broken down by final expenditure and kind of economic activity .  
It was regrettable that , instead of striving to halt the widespread gross violations of human rights in their own societies and rectifying their racist and discriminatory attitudes towards nationals of other countries residing in their territories , certain States arrogated to themselves the role of universal guardians and preachers of human rights , levelling unsubstantiated accusations against other countries on a purely selective basis .  
The General Assembly could not remain silent at the gross and systematic violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of the populations of developing countries caused by such measures , which were in flagrant violation of international law .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
Today , we have a stable national currency , a minimum rate of inflation , greater economic potential , and a gross domestic product with an annual growth rate of 14 per cent .  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Communications under the 1503 procedure are admissible only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they may reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; any replies received from the Governments concerned must be taken into account . 
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
The international community and international organizations were requested to support national initiatives and implementation of the targets set in the Platform for Action , including the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance .  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Noting that the current , severe maldistribution of income prevents millions from enjoying economic and social rights and that gross inequalities prevent social harmony , Mr . Eide added that the focus of his report was rather on the impact of different structures of international and national income distribution on human rights . 
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
It believed that the Secretary-General 's statement that it would be possible to absorb the additional cost of $ 2,841,300 gross within the total revised appropriation of $ 2,603,280,900 for the biennium 1996-1997 given the fact that the United States dollar had appreciated to a significant extent since December 1996 was premature , since it was impossible to make precise forecasts of currency movements in the last six months of 1997 . 
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5.6 million dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 dollars gross ( 10-million dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
Unless the developed countries fulfil their commitment to reach the United Nations accepted target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and intensify their efforts to reverse the present downward trend , hopes for the least developed countries will remain as grim as ever .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
Governments and international organizations should apply , as soon as possible , the 20 / 20 concept and the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance , as accepted at the World Summit for Social Development and reinforced in the Platform for Action in a gender-balanced way .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Of the total cost estimates contained in the report , 59 per cent are based on standard costs and ratios , while the remaining 41 per cent cover mission - specific requirements ; non-recurrent costs amount to $ 2,517,000 gross , while recurrent costs amount to $ 29,851,000 gross .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Following a short discussion , the Sub-Commission , in resolution 1993 / 30 , expressed its appreciation to Mr . Chernichenko for that working paper and decided to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights his appointment as Special Rapporteur to prepare a report entitled Recognition of gross and large _ scale violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of Governments or sanctioned by them as an international crime .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
The responsibility of individuals , acting on behalf of a State and participating in the perpetration , by that State , of gross and massive violations of human rights constituting an international crime can be realized on the basis of the laws of the State which was injured as a result of the crime , on the basis of the laws of the State on behalf of which the individuals in question acted , or in accordance with an international agreement .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
In 1996 , 58 per cent - or $ 551-million of total income - was received as general resources which UNICEF allocated to Board approved programmes supporting children and women , guided by a needs-based formula ( size of child population , under-five mortality rate , per capita gross national product ( GNP ) ) .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of [ 102,706,078 dollars gross ( 105,971,529 dollars net ) ] in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
Mr . Weissbrodt stated that Mr . Chernichenkos important work greatly assisted the groups understanding of relevant aspects of international law , particularly in defining gross and massive violations of human rights .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
Such assistance represented 8.4 per cent of its gross national product , one of the highest rates in the world , and reflected its concern to raise the standard of living of the developing countries by helping to strengthen their economic infrastructure .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
We need maximum official development assistance at the required international level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to aid us in our war against illegal drugs .  
RAIG ( Estonia ) said that a permanent , independent , impartial and effective international criminal court was needed , in the light of persistent gross violations of human rights .  
Countries at level 1 are characterized by compiling gross domestic product at current and constant prices , broken down by kind of economic activity and final expenditure .  
Globally , ODA has fallen to just 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996 the lowest level since foreign aid was institutionalized with the Marshall Plan about 50 years ago .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
The target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the developed countries gross national product to official development assistance , which had been considered the absolute minimum two decades previously , now looked like an unattainable dream .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
The right to a remedy 23 / is indicated to require that : ( i ) each State ensure that adequate remedies are available to any person claiming a violation of rights and ensure their right of access to these remedies ; ( ii ) each legal system provide prompt and effective procedures to ensure readily accessible and adequate remedies , and protection from intimidation and retaliation ; and ( iii ) each State provide universal jurisdiction over gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
High growth of gross national product ( GNP ) or the reduction of inflation does not lead to development unless it is accompanied by changes in the distribution of income , enabling a larger portion of the population to realize their economic , social and cultural rights .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Finally , in instances of losses due to fraud , which is regarded as a gross violation of the standards of integrity expected of an international civil servant , the staff member may be summarily dismissed if the misconduct is patent , or may be subject to other disciplinary action , in addition to the Organizations efforts to obtain full recovery of the fraudulently misappropriated funds . 
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
For example , in advanced economies , average proportional revenue collections have not fallen at all so far ; in fact , the average proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries collected as revenue continued to edge up during the 1990s . 
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
In this connection , the Special Rapporteur received consistent information that the Government of the Sudan is providing arms and ammunition to paramilitary groups such as the Murahaleen which are commonly held responsible for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
The combined gross national product of the aggressors is 1,163 times that of the victim , their population 77 times larger , their territory 226 times bigger , their troops 43 times more numerous .  The Serb people 's resistance has been heroic , but at what a cost : thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded , terrible deprivation , a country in ruins , children traumatized for life by the bombing .  
The first type is in terms of the gross output , based on its status and whether it is a final ( parliamentary services , published material , information materials and services , advisory services , training courses / seminars / workshops ) or an intermediate ( coordination , harmonization and liaison or international cooperation ) output .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 20 _ 21 and 29 _ 37 above ) . 
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
Decides further that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
It is because they recognize that , " in an unequal society , the families below the poverty line are doomed to remain poor in absolute as well as relative terms " , that some countries have resorted to affirmative action , equal opportunity laws and other pro-active measures to correct gross disparities at the start . 
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
The United States of America , as a permanent member of the Security Council , had a special responsibility towards the Organization ; it was also the sole beneficiary of the 25-per-cent ceiling on contributions to the regular budget , with the result that its assessment level was considerably lower than its share of global gross national product ( GNP ) .  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
The proposed budget of UNMIK for the period from its inception on 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 provides for a total strength of 9,812 personnel , including 38 military liaison officers , 4,718 civilian police , 1,269 international staff , 3,566 local staff , 18 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers , and amounts to $ 456,451,200 gross , inclusive of the commitment authority of $ 200-million already authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 241 of 28 July 1999 .  
In the resolution , the Commission condemned the widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in East Timor , including widespread violations and abuses of the right to life , personal security , physical integrity and the right to property .  
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
In order to give a rough idea of what that volume of capital means , I must point out that a single day of operations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice the annual gross national product of all the African countries .  
The call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral resources for social development and the commitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance falls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the Copenhagen Summit .  
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
In its report dated 10 October 1997 ( A 52-451 ) , the Advisory Committee , taking into account the preliminary unencumbered balance from the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 of some $ 2.5-million gross and the additional amount of $ 3 , 273 , 800 gross ( $ 3 , 233 , 000 net ) committed for the electoral process , indicated that there was no need at that time for the additional assessment requested by the Secretary-General ( see para . 6 above ) .  
It is generally acknowledged that a comparative income approach is not feasible because of the inability to separate out the implicit unit price and quantity elements , especially in the case of gross or net operating surplus .  
As a consequence , the Secretary-General submitted an updated revised budget for MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 in the amount of $ 47 , 402 , 100 gross ( $ 44 , 419 , 700 net ) ( see A 52-730 Add . 2 ) , which reflected the additional requirements for demining activities while at the same time revising downward the additional requirements for the identification process set out in his earlier report ( A 52-730 ) . 
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
It is recalled that pursuant to Security Council resolution 1260 ( 1999 ) of 20 ( August 1999 , by which the Council authorized the provisional expansion of UNOMSIL , the Observer Missions original budget for the 1999-2000 financial period ( A 53-454 Add . 1 ) had been revised to $ 34 , 382 , 400 gross ( $ 32 , 870 , 100 net ) ( see A 54-455 ) .  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
We say that the reasoning is unfair , being based on our high per capita gross domestic product , without taking into account either our ability to pay or the seriously disproportionate distribution of national income between capital , labour and taxation .  
Efforts are being made at the national level , yet , paradoxically , official development assistance is still decreasing , and the commitment made by rich countries to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product is far from being fulfilled .  
By cutting deep into all sectors of society , it undermines vital economic growth , perhaps reducing future national gross domestic product size in the region by a third over the next 20 years .  
As supported by various legal opinions , it has been the policy of the Organization since 1969 that proof of gross negligence or wilful misconduct is required to justify a staff member being held accountable for losses to the Organization . 
Had these assets been freely available , they might have made a major contribution to the economic and social development process and it is possible that they might have increased more than twofold by contributing to gross domestic product .  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period , and with gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :

We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Sweden has a strong commitment to continued international development cooperation , and we are among those four countries that meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance .  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period and gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :

The consequences of such failures are only too obvious : too many belligerent groups targeting the innocent and the defenceless ; massive numbers of refugees forced to flee for safety ; gross and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated .  
Decides that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 257,700 dollars gross ( 200,300 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999 ;  
It should be stressed that some of these gross breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) .  
The level and share of gross capital formation have grown in recent years , reflecting the unabated boom in private residential construction activity since 1994 .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
In addition to conceptual problems , such as the Committees imprecise mandate in this regard , the definition of groups and a possible double counting as this factor affects the level of gross national product ( GNP ) , it is not clear that sufficient and compatible data is available to study this issue comprehensively .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
In his previous report , the Special Representative had drawn attention to the considerable discrimination faced by women in Equatorial Guinea , as reflected in the fact that the gross national product produced by women is less than half that produced by men ; the illiteracy rate among women is three times greater than among men ; and the number of women reaching secondary school level is half that of men , among other factors .  
The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case . 
That report concluded that for African countries to be able to attain the target of reducing poverty by half by 2015 , set by the World Social Summit in Copenhagen , an average annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of around 7 per cent and an investment rate of around 33 per cent of GDP were required .  
In paragraph 15 of its resolution 54 / 17 B on the financing of MONUA , the General Assembly , acting on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee contained in its report dated 4 April 2000 ( A / 54 / 831 ) , took note of the unencumbered balance of $ 149,500 gross and of the additional requirements of $ 787,600 net in respect of the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 and decided to defer action thereon until its review of the final performance information on the Verification Mission and the Observer Mission .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,

Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 324,900 dollars gross ( 297,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 18 above ;  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 57,990,000 dollars gross ( 53,116,100 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 19 above ;  
Decides to apply the unencumbered balance of 1,300,900 dollars from the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 , inclusive of 1,273,000 dollars in miscellaneous and interest income , and to prorate the balance of 75,846,200 dollars gross ( 66,562,500 dollars net ) among the individual active peacekeeping operation budgets , to meet the resources required for the support account for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 . 
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
The costs involved are certainly much less than the overall costs of malnourishment and malnutrition : for example , it has been calculated that malnutrition costs Pakistan 5 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and just iron deficiency in children costs Bangladesh 2 per cent of GDP . 81 The fact that the primary cause of hunger and malnutrition is poverty does not prevent efficient measures being taken that are not costly . 
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
He expressed his dismay at the persistent failure of the warring parties to abide by international humanitarian norms and to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable for their actions .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
Thus the weighted average of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita ( estimated at current official exchange rates ) is estimated to be $ 0.65 per day for the total population in African LDCs and $ 0.88 per day in Asian LDCs in the late 1990s , whilst in PPP terms ( in 1985 international prices ) it is estimated to be $ 1.51 per day in African LDCs and $ 4.59 per day in Asian LDCs .  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
The Committee expresses its deep concern about the State partys continuing gross violations of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , especially the severe measures adopted by the State party to restrict the movement of civilians between points within and outside the occupied territories , severing their access to food , water , health care , education and work .  
In Southern and East Africa , for example , the benefits from harmonized axle load limits are as follows : ( i ) transport operators are able to load their trucks with the maximum payload ; ( ii ) harmonized axle load limits facilitate uniform axle load enforcement ; ( iii ) these limits also facilitate exchange of information on overloading and on habitual violators of axle load limits ; and ( iv ) there is uniform application of fines for overloading and excessive gross vehicle weights , based on an agreed pavement damage formula .  
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
The effects have included a major decline in the countrys gross domestic product and in per capita income ; a sharp increase in mortality rates , especially among mothers and children ; marked deterioration in infrastructure , especially in connection with the water supply , sewerage , electricity and hospitals and health centres ; a drop in school enrolment to 53 per cent and the consequent cultural and scientific impoverishment ; and the destruction of the social fabric .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
The deterioration of the human rights situation and the continuing pattern of gross and systematic violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement ;  
The severe restrictions on the freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , the restrictions on citizens access to information , including censorship controls on all forms of domestic media and many international publications , and the restrictions imposed on citizens wishing to travel within the country and abroad , including the denial of passports on political grounds , and gross interference in private life , family , home or correspondence ; 5 .  Calls upon the Government of Myanmar :

Calls upon the Government of Myanmar :  
The period 1991-1994 , which was characterized by evident economic difficulties insofar as the gross domestic product declined , the average rate of growth amounted to 1 per cent , the public budget recorded a large deficit equivalent to 16.7 per cent of GDP in 1994 and the balance-of-payments deficit amounted to 13 per cent of GNP ;  
Disclosure : failure of a public official , either wilfully or through gross negligence , to disclose accurately on an annual basis his or her assets , liabilities and net worth in order to defraud the Government of obligations such as taxes and / or to deceive the proper authorities of his or her unlawful activities and proceeds ;  
The most recent annual report of UNCTAD stated that the average annual increase rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the least developed nations from 2000 to 2002 was 4.9 percent ; the average annual increase in the per capita GDP was 2.6 percent , exceeding the 1.8 percent level of average annual increase in the per capita GDP of other developing countries .  
Having gone through the deficit phase incurred by the whole industry in the last half year , China 's chemical industry completed an annual gross industrial output value of 278-billion yuan , with a growth rate of 8% , and continuing to maintain steady growth .  
Multinationals are the main engine of world economic growth , especially international investment .  In the last several years , multinationals have engaged in and controlled 1 / 3 of the world 's gross product , 2 / 3 of the world trade , 70% of the direct investment , and 80% of the technology transfer and the research and development of civilian technology .  
Gross domestic output values reached 73-billion yuan in 1995 , increasing by 4 times compared with 1978 , before the reform and opening up .  The average living expenses and income of city and township residents reached 4053 yuan , and the average pure income of peasants reached 1554 yuan .  The total industrial and agricultural output value was 144-billion yuan , among which the former was 120.1-billion yuan .  Third industry output values reached 24.7-billion yuan , accounting for 33% of the gross domestic output value .  
According to data provided by the Guangzhou Statistics Office , last year , Guangzhou completed a gross domestic product of 144.584-billion yuan ; completed industrial added values of 57.348-billion yuan ; agricultural added values of 8.075-billion yuan ; fixed asset investments of 65.545-billion yuan ; total social consumable retail amounts of 64.432-billion yuan ; foreign trade export values of 6.513-billion US dollars ; actual utilized foreign investments of 2.6-billion US dollars ; and a retail goods price index increase of 4.3% .  
He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation .  When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , etc . , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .  
Consumer demand is short for three main reasons : 1 .  Since reform and opening , while the absolute value of the income and consumption level of Chinese residents has been growing steadily , the ratio of our society 's gross product that is eventually used for consumption , or the final consumption rate , has been in a falling trend , with our accumulation or savings rate having tended to rise .  
It was based on such thinking that Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the three-step strategic objective of our country 's modernization construction : from 1980 onwards , using 10 years to double gross national product so as to resolve the problem of food and clothing ;  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
We succeeded in achieving the goal of quadrupling the value of the gross output on the basis of the 1980 figures ahead of time .  Moreover , while the population continued to grow , we also achieved the goal of quadrupling the per capita amount of the value of the gross national output , thus raising social productivity and the people 's living standards to substantively higher level .  
After this five-year plan is fulfilled , with the efforts of five more years , that is , by the year 2010 , we will establish a sound and perfect socialist market economic structure , and will further double the value of the gross national output on the basis of the 2000 figure , thus further enhancing the people 's living standards .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
Our comprehensive national capability is now of a substantial size .  Our gross domestic product is expected to reach 8,600-billion yuan for 2000 , with the overall economic volume being the seventh largest in the world ; foreign exchange reserves total over $ 160-billion ;  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Xiamen 's gross national product roseby 16.6 percent on an annual average and the city 's GNP and financial revenue also ranked the first among all special economic zones .  
After the establishment of socialism in China , its age-old image of poverty and weakness underwent a rapid change ; regardless of repeated frustrations and complications , China 's economic growth rate was among the highest in the world , its gross national product jumped forward to rank seventh in the world .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
The committee members held that the economic situation in the first quarter of this year was rather stable , and the gross domestic product increased by 8.1 percent according to comparable prices over the same period of the previous year .  The growth rate was kept at the same level as that of the same period last year .  A good tendency to grow steadily was maintained .  
By 9 May , the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region had cracked down on 3,286 criminal cases , crushed 49 criminal gangs involving secret societies and evil forces , and pronounced mass judgments on 221 cases of gross violence and 326 criminals .  
Under the banner of " self defense " , they broke through the " restricted zone " set by the constitution and relevant ordinances .  They have kept engaging in arms expansion .  They have increased their military spending year by year , ignoring long ago the regulation that Japan 's military expenditure is not allowed to exceed 1 percent of its gross national product .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
In his briefing to a news conference , which held by the Information Office of the State Council today , Liu Hong said : In 1999 , China 's gross domestic product topped the mark of 8,000 billion yuan , or an increased of 7.1 percent over the previous year calculated on comparable items , thus achieving the expected growth target . 
With the transition to a market economy , the basic completion of small privatization , and the emergence and development of market-based service entities , Russia 's tertiary industries have developed rapidly , accounting for a growing share of the gross domestic product , while the shares of the primary and secondary industries have declined .

According to a recent survey concerning the income of 40,000 urban and rural households by the State Statistics Bureau 's Urban Social and Economic Survey team , in 1999 , urban residents had an average per capita disposable income of 5854 yuan , for an increase of 7.9 percent over the previous year .  After removing the influence of price factors , the actual increase in income was 9.3 percent , a rate of growth higher than that for the gross domestic product .  
Statistics show that , during the first six months , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew 8.2% , industrial added value increased 9.9% , the total retail value of social consumables was up 10.1% , investments in fixed assets grew 12.1% , and foreign trade exports increased by 38.3% , so each of the macroeconomic indicators continues to develop in a good direction .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .  
Wang Yingfan noted that developed countries should further open their markets to developing countries , meet at the earliest possible date the target of raising their official development aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product , and fully and effectively solve the foreign-debt problem of developing countries .

In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
In the light of recent and prospective changes in peace-keeping operations , the Secretary-General has undertaken what is described as a comprehensive " bottom-up " review of backstopping requirements at Headquarters and determined that the establishment of 355 posts and a total requirement of $ 37.2-million gross represent the minimum necessary to ensure the backstopping support required for active , completed and closed missions for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 .  
Decides also to appropriate the amount of 4,632,500 dollars gross ( 4,152,200 dollars net ) for the administrative closing of the Assistance Mission for the period subsequent to 19 April 1996 , inclusive of the amount of 50,200 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations , to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution ;  
Decides also to appropriate the amount of 4,632,500 dollars gross ( 4,152,200 dollars net ) for the administrative closing of the Assistance Mission for the period subsequent to 19 April 1996 , inclusive of the amount of 50,200 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations , to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution ;  
Decides further , as an ad hoc and exceptional arrangement , that Member States shall waive their respective shares in the remaining credits arising from previous budgets of the United Nations Protection Force in an amount of 8,455,336 dollars gross ( 8,601,911 dollars net ) , to be transferred to the Special Account for the International Tribunal from the Special Account for the United Nations Protection Force established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 233 of 19 March 1992 ;  
With regard to the new programming period , starting 1997 , the Administrator proposes that the basic principles of the waiver system be maintained on the understanding that the waiver bands and the base year for per capita gross national product ( GNP ) data are adjusted in line with Executive Board decision 95 / 23 on successor programming arrangements .  These changes are reflected below and will apply to the second year of the 1996-1997 biennial budget .  
Performance generally reflected strong growth in tourism and in offshore financial services , as well as increased domestic investment , with the gross domestic product recorded at US $ 90.2-million .  
From 1973 to 1992 , the total official development assistance for all developing countries registered a remarkable stability ranging from 0.32 per cent to 0.34 per cent of donor gross national product .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
In Israel , for example , members of the national trade union organization , Histadrut , which includes 85 per cent of wage-earners , are simultaneously owners and members of a parallel system of cooperative business enterprises active in most economic sectors ; in aggregate , they account for 25 per cent of the gross national product .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
The General Assembly should reaffirm the importance of striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance and endorse the need to increase the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals set out in commitment 2 , relating to the eradication of poverty , of the Copenhagen Declaration and chapter 2 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit .  
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
Phase 1 contains basic gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices , broken down by final expenditure and kind of economic activity .  
It was regrettable that , instead of striving to halt the widespread gross violations of human rights in their own societies and rectifying their racist and discriminatory attitudes towards nationals of other countries residing in their territories , certain States arrogated to themselves the role of universal guardians and preachers of human rights , levelling unsubstantiated accusations against other countries on a purely selective basis .  
The General Assembly could not remain silent at the gross and systematic violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of the populations of developing countries caused by such measures , which were in flagrant violation of international law .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
Today , we have a stable national currency , a minimum rate of inflation , greater economic potential , and a gross domestic product with an annual growth rate of 14 per cent .  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Communications under the 1503 procedure are admissible only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they may reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; any replies received from the Governments concerned must be taken into account . 
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
The international community and international organizations were requested to support national initiatives and implementation of the targets set in the Platform for Action , including the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance .  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Noting that the current , severe maldistribution of income prevents millions from enjoying economic and social rights and that gross inequalities prevent social harmony , Mr . Eide added that the focus of his report was rather on the impact of different structures of international and national income distribution on human rights . 
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
It believed that the Secretary-General 's statement that it would be possible to absorb the additional cost of $ 2,841,300 gross within the total revised appropriation of $ 2,603,280,900 for the biennium 1996-1997 given the fact that the United States dollar had appreciated to a significant extent since December 1996 was premature , since it was impossible to make precise forecasts of currency movements in the last six months of 1997 . 
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5.6 million dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 dollars gross ( 10-million dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
Unless the developed countries fulfil their commitment to reach the United Nations accepted target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and intensify their efforts to reverse the present downward trend , hopes for the least developed countries will remain as grim as ever .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
Governments and international organizations should apply , as soon as possible , the 20 / 20 concept and the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance , as accepted at the World Summit for Social Development and reinforced in the Platform for Action in a gender-balanced way .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Of the total cost estimates contained in the report , 59 per cent are based on standard costs and ratios , while the remaining 41 per cent cover mission - specific requirements ; non-recurrent costs amount to $ 2,517,000 gross , while recurrent costs amount to $ 29,851,000 gross .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Following a short discussion , the Sub-Commission , in resolution 1993 / 30 , expressed its appreciation to Mr . Chernichenko for that working paper and decided to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights his appointment as Special Rapporteur to prepare a report entitled Recognition of gross and large _ scale violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of Governments or sanctioned by them as an international crime .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
The responsibility of individuals , acting on behalf of a State and participating in the perpetration , by that State , of gross and massive violations of human rights constituting an international crime can be realized on the basis of the laws of the State which was injured as a result of the crime , on the basis of the laws of the State on behalf of which the individuals in question acted , or in accordance with an international agreement .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
In 1996 , 58 per cent - or $ 551-million of total income - was received as general resources which UNICEF allocated to Board approved programmes supporting children and women , guided by a needs-based formula ( size of child population , under-five mortality rate , per capita gross national product ( GNP ) ) .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of [ 102,706,078 dollars gross ( 105,971,529 dollars net ) ] in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
Mr . Weissbrodt stated that Mr . Chernichenkos important work greatly assisted the groups understanding of relevant aspects of international law , particularly in defining gross and massive violations of human rights .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
Such assistance represented 8.4 per cent of its gross national product , one of the highest rates in the world , and reflected its concern to raise the standard of living of the developing countries by helping to strengthen their economic infrastructure .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
We need maximum official development assistance at the required international level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to aid us in our war against illegal drugs .  
RAIG ( Estonia ) said that a permanent , independent , impartial and effective international criminal court was needed , in the light of persistent gross violations of human rights .  
Countries at level 1 are characterized by compiling gross domestic product at current and constant prices , broken down by kind of economic activity and final expenditure .  
Globally , ODA has fallen to just 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996 the lowest level since foreign aid was institutionalized with the Marshall Plan about 50 years ago .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
The target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the developed countries gross national product to official development assistance , which had been considered the absolute minimum two decades previously , now looked like an unattainable dream .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
The right to a remedy 23 / is indicated to require that : ( i ) each State ensure that adequate remedies are available to any person claiming a violation of rights and ensure their right of access to these remedies ; ( ii ) each legal system provide prompt and effective procedures to ensure readily accessible and adequate remedies , and protection from intimidation and retaliation ; and ( iii ) each State provide universal jurisdiction over gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
High growth of gross national product ( GNP ) or the reduction of inflation does not lead to development unless it is accompanied by changes in the distribution of income , enabling a larger portion of the population to realize their economic , social and cultural rights .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Finally , in instances of losses due to fraud , which is regarded as a gross violation of the standards of integrity expected of an international civil servant , the staff member may be summarily dismissed if the misconduct is patent , or may be subject to other disciplinary action , in addition to the Organizations efforts to obtain full recovery of the fraudulently misappropriated funds . 
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
For example , in advanced economies , average proportional revenue collections have not fallen at all so far ; in fact , the average proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries collected as revenue continued to edge up during the 1990s . 
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
In this connection , the Special Rapporteur received consistent information that the Government of the Sudan is providing arms and ammunition to paramilitary groups such as the Murahaleen which are commonly held responsible for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
The combined gross national product of the aggressors is 1,163 times that of the victim , their population 77 times larger , their territory 226 times bigger , their troops 43 times more numerous .  The Serb people 's resistance has been heroic , but at what a cost : thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded , terrible deprivation , a country in ruins , children traumatized for life by the bombing .  
The first type is in terms of the gross output , based on its status and whether it is a final ( parliamentary services , published material , information materials and services , advisory services , training courses / seminars / workshops ) or an intermediate ( coordination , harmonization and liaison or international cooperation ) output .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 20 _ 21 and 29 _ 37 above ) . 
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
Decides further that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
It is because they recognize that , " in an unequal society , the families below the poverty line are doomed to remain poor in absolute as well as relative terms " , that some countries have resorted to affirmative action , equal opportunity laws and other pro-active measures to correct gross disparities at the start . 
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The annual summary of the economic and social situation in Africa submitted this year to the Economic and Social Council put the figure for gross domestic product growth in 1998 at 3.3 per cent , up from 2.9 per cent in 1997 , the highest growth rate of any region in the world ; it reported that the 33 African least developed countries increased their growth rate from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 4.1 per cent in 1998 . 
The United States of America , as a permanent member of the Security Council , had a special responsibility towards the Organization ; it was also the sole beneficiary of the 25-per-cent ceiling on contributions to the regular budget , with the result that its assessment level was considerably lower than its share of global gross national product ( GNP ) .  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
The proposed budget of UNMIK for the period from its inception on 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 provides for a total strength of 9,812 personnel , including 38 military liaison officers , 4,718 civilian police , 1,269 international staff , 3,566 local staff , 18 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers , and amounts to $ 456,451,200 gross , inclusive of the commitment authority of $ 200-million already authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 241 of 28 July 1999 .  
In the resolution , the Commission condemned the widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in East Timor , including widespread violations and abuses of the right to life , personal security , physical integrity and the right to property .  
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
In order to give a rough idea of what that volume of capital means , I must point out that a single day of operations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice the annual gross national product of all the African countries .  
The call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral resources for social development and the commitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance falls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the Copenhagen Summit .  
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
In its report dated 10 October 1997 ( A 52-451 ) , the Advisory Committee , taking into account the preliminary unencumbered balance from the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 of some $ 2.5-million gross and the additional amount of $ 3 , 273 , 800 gross ( $ 3 , 233 , 000 net ) committed for the electoral process , indicated that there was no need at that time for the additional assessment requested by the Secretary-General ( see para . 6 above ) .  
It is generally acknowledged that a comparative income approach is not feasible because of the inability to separate out the implicit unit price and quantity elements , especially in the case of gross or net operating surplus .  
As a consequence , the Secretary-General submitted an updated revised budget for MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 in the amount of $ 47 , 402 , 100 gross ( $ 44 , 419 , 700 net ) ( see A 52-730 Add . 2 ) , which reflected the additional requirements for demining activities while at the same time revising downward the additional requirements for the identification process set out in his earlier report ( A 52-730 ) . 
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
Any integral pallet base forming part of a large packaging or any detachable pallet shall be suitable for mechanical handling with the large packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass .  
It is recalled that pursuant to Security Council resolution 1260 ( 1999 ) of 20 ( August 1999 , by which the Council authorized the provisional expansion of UNOMSIL , the Observer Missions original budget for the 1999-2000 financial period ( A 53-454 Add . 1 ) had been revised to $ 34 , 382 , 400 gross ( $ 32 , 870 , 100 net ) ( see A 54-455 ) .  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
We say that the reasoning is unfair , being based on our high per capita gross domestic product , without taking into account either our ability to pay or the seriously disproportionate distribution of national income between capital , labour and taxation .  
Efforts are being made at the national level , yet , paradoxically , official development assistance is still decreasing , and the commitment made by rich countries to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product is far from being fulfilled .  
By cutting deep into all sectors of society , it undermines vital economic growth , perhaps reducing future national gross domestic product size in the region by a third over the next 20 years .  
As supported by various legal opinions , it has been the policy of the Organization since 1969 that proof of gross negligence or wilful misconduct is required to justify a staff member being held accountable for losses to the Organization . 
Had these assets been freely available , they might have made a major contribution to the economic and social development process and it is possible that they might have increased more than twofold by contributing to gross domestic product .  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period , and with gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period , and with gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Sweden has a strong commitment to continued international development cooperation , and we are among those four countries that meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance .  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period and gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period and gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :  
The consequences of such failures are only too obvious : too many belligerent groups targeting the innocent and the defenceless ; massive numbers of refugees forced to flee for safety ; gross and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated .  
Decides that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 257,700 dollars gross ( 200,300 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999 ;  
It should be stressed that some of these gross breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) .  
The level and share of gross capital formation have grown in recent years , reflecting the unabated boom in private residential construction activity since 1994 .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
In addition to conceptual problems , such as the Committees imprecise mandate in this regard , the definition of groups and a possible double counting as this factor affects the level of gross national product ( GNP ) , it is not clear that sufficient and compatible data is available to study this issue comprehensively .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
In his previous report , the Special Representative had drawn attention to the considerable discrimination faced by women in Equatorial Guinea , as reflected in the fact that the gross national product produced by women is less than half that produced by men ; the illiteracy rate among women is three times greater than among men ; and the number of women reaching secondary school level is half that of men , among other factors .  
The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case . 
That report concluded that for African countries to be able to attain the target of reducing poverty by half by 2015 , set by the World Social Summit in Copenhagen , an average annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of around 7 per cent and an investment rate of around 33 per cent of GDP were required .  
In paragraph 15 of its resolution 54 / 17 B on the financing of MONUA , the General Assembly , acting on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee contained in its report dated 4 April 2000 ( A / 54 / 831 ) , took note of the unencumbered balance of $ 149,500 gross and of the additional requirements of $ 787,600 net in respect of the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 and decided to defer action thereon until its review of the final performance information on the Verification Mission and the Observer Mission .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,

Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 324,900 dollars gross ( 297,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 18 above ;  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 57,990,000 dollars gross ( 53,116,100 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 19 above ;  
Decides to apply the unencumbered balance of 1,300,900 dollars from the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 , inclusive of 1,273,000 dollars in miscellaneous and interest income , and to prorate the balance of 75,846,200 dollars gross ( 66,562,500 dollars net ) among the individual active peacekeeping operation budgets , to meet the resources required for the support account for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 . 
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
The costs involved are certainly much less than the overall costs of malnourishment and malnutrition : for example , it has been calculated that malnutrition costs Pakistan 5 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and just iron deficiency in children costs Bangladesh 2 per cent of GDP . 81 The fact that the primary cause of hunger and malnutrition is poverty does not prevent efficient measures being taken that are not costly . 
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
He expressed his dismay at the persistent failure of the warring parties to abide by international humanitarian norms and to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable for their actions .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
Thus the weighted average of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita ( estimated at current official exchange rates ) is estimated to be $ 0.65 per day for the total population in African LDCs and $ 0.88 per day in Asian LDCs in the late 1990s , whilst in PPP terms ( in 1985 international prices ) it is estimated to be $ 1.51 per day in African LDCs and $ 4.59 per day in Asian LDCs .  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
The Committee expresses its deep concern about the State partys continuing gross violations of economic , social and cultural rights in the occupied territories , especially the severe measures adopted by the State party to restrict the movement of civilians between points within and outside the occupied territories , severing their access to food , water , health care , education and work .  
In Southern and East Africa , for example , the benefits from harmonized axle load limits are as follows : ( i ) transport operators are able to load their trucks with the maximum payload ; ( ii ) harmonized axle load limits facilitate uniform axle load enforcement ; ( iii ) these limits also facilitate exchange of information on overloading and on habitual violators of axle load limits ; and ( iv ) there is uniform application of fines for overloading and excessive gross vehicle weights , based on an agreed pavement damage formula .  
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
The effects have included a major decline in the countrys gross domestic product and in per capita income ; a sharp increase in mortality rates , especially among mothers and children ; marked deterioration in infrastructure , especially in connection with the water supply , sewerage , electricity and hospitals and health centres ; a drop in school enrolment to 53 per cent and the consequent cultural and scientific impoverishment ; and the destruction of the social fabric .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
The deterioration of the human rights situation and the continuing pattern of gross and systematic violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement ;  
The severe restrictions on the freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , the restrictions on citizens access to information , including censorship controls on all forms of domestic media and many international publications , and the restrictions imposed on citizens wishing to travel within the country and abroad , including the denial of passports on political grounds , and gross interference in private life , family , home or correspondence ; 5 .

The period 1991-1994 , which was characterized by evident economic difficulties insofar as the gross domestic product declined , the average rate of growth amounted to 1 per cent , the public budget recorded a large deficit equivalent to 16.7 per cent of GDP in 1994 and the balance-of-payments deficit amounted to 13 per cent of GNP ;  
Disclosure : failure of a public official , either wilfully or through gross negligence , to disclose accurately on an annual basis his or her assets , liabilities and net worth in order to defraud the Government of obligations such as taxes and / or to deceive the proper authorities of his or her unlawful activities and proceeds ;
