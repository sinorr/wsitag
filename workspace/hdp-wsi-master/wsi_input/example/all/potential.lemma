In the face of China 's enormous economic body , abundant resources , large labor force , and vast market , of course we can not ignore China 's competitive potential if its economic reform develops in a sustained and smooth manner .

As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .

The land lots owned by HA account for about 73.3 per cent of the total amalgamated area .  Had the HA not taken the initiative to redevelop NPE , the potential of this prime site would not have been released for the benefit of the entire community .

Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
Our economic growth rate has averaged 8.5 percent over the past ten years , an accomplishment which is the focus of world attention .

Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential . But among the paths taken by Taiwan photographers in the 1960s , Ch'en 's development , from amateur realistic photographer to a sketcher of imagistic scenery , can be considered representative .  
Under present circumstances , some areas can not be reported to you yet but there is one point that we should understand concerning the future development of the countries , centered around the newly industrialized countries .

Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
So prudent parents ship their kid off early to one of the numerous cram schools around the city , to a " supplemental class for the exceptionally gifted , " " children 's potential enhancement center " or " simultaneous development course for the left and right sides of the brain . "  
Looking further ahead , " in fact , education for the gifted should n't be a monopoly of the elite , " teacher Lin Chih-chung says . " Everyone has the right to being trained in nonrigid thinking .

Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Perhaps adult fireflies , who use their light to match up with their spouse , have grown dazzled and dazed by the streets lined with lights . With potential mates lost in the glare , they live celibate lives .

"  
In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species . Today we must work hard to make up for this lacuna , otherwise if non-native species are planted as cash crops , the final result may be the same as with pine wilt disease : that we will benefit from neither the introduced nor our native species .

Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
It is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain development in 1997 ( see para . 75 below ) will alert Governments and national agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
In the fifth cycle , a substantial part of the indicative planning figures again went to this sector ( $ 4,790,000 ) ; in the mining sector , UNDP 's objective during the current cycle has been to help the Government mobilize other sources of finance and to attract potential investors with a view to exploiting mineral resources that have already been identified ( with geological maps , by drafting a mining code and publishing information brochures ) .  
The past decade demonstrated that by expanding opportunities for women , especially in ways that enhance their productivity and income-earning potential , women will be able to raise their standard of living , thereby contributing to improved family well-being and the reduction and eradication of poverty , as well as to better national economic performance .  
Also encourages the above-mentioned organizations to contribute fully to increasing world awareness of the problems and potential of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth , and world leaders to commit themselves to making cities , towns and villages in their countries healthy , safe , just and sustainable ;  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
It is indeed regrettable that the OIC Contact Group does not utilize in the right way its undoubted political potential and that it gives evidence by producing such political pamphlets that its exclusive goal is to satisfy its current political propaganda needs and not to contribute in this very vital and sensitive moment to an urgent achievement of a political settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Biotechnology applications have the potential for making major contributions to the health and welfare of humanity , although biotechnology is still perceived by many to have undesirable and partly unforeseeable ecological , socio-economic , legal and ethical implications .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Also believe that the current mandate leaves substantial room for a more assertive and effective mission by UNPROFOR and relevant regional organizations , especially bearing in mind Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , although there could be potential enhancement of the existing Security Council mandate of UNPROFOR ;  
Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
Replenishments in 1994 should refurbish multilateral commitment potential if the familiar cyclical pattern holds up , but if adequate funds are not forthcoming from donors , the level of the activities of the multilateral agencies could be impaired in later years .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
Strongly appeals to all women , in particular rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
To encourage Governments , relevant international organizations and the private sector to undertake further work with regard to the application of economic instruments , including tax reforms and the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in accordance with the conditions , needs and priorities of each country and giving full consideration to their potential environmental , economic and social impacts .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
A review and recent evaluation of the experience of past capacities and needs matching exercises sponsored by the Special Unit for TCDC suggests the need to ensure that these exercises are an adequately prepared , demand-driven process where needs and capacities identified are realistic in terms of their potential application and relevant to key development objectives of recipient countries , and that adequate funding has been arranged to carry out the resulting agreements .  
That until this problem affecting Guatemalan society is resolved , its economic , political , social and cultural potential will never be able to develop fully and neither will it be able to take the place in the community of nations due to it by virtue of its ancient history and the spiritual grandeur of its peoples ;  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The main objectives of the association are to further economic integration , develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea and strengthen functional cooperation in the political , cultural , scientific , social and technological areas .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
The wealth of knowledge of social and economic priorities and expanded networks of relationships with politicians and technicians in the respective regions offer an impressive potential for leadership in the United Nations system , as well as for developing networks and partnerships for selecting development priorities and designing programmes and projects .  
Social justice at the national and international levels is an imperative , for only under an elevated form of social justice can the full potential of human resources development be realized .  
" human resources development is a broad concept . . . requiring integrated and concerted strategies , policies , plans and programmes to ensure the development of the full potential of human beings . . . so that they may , individually and collectively , be capable of improving their standard of living " .  
The Canadian costing officer who had led the ad hoc group discussions on the development of major equipment wet and dry lease rates explained the criteria and methodology used .  In achieving fairness , rates had been developed using four factors : generic fair market value of the equipment , the useful life of the item , the potential for loss or damage and , for wet lease arrangements , the costs of maintenance ( consisting of spare parts and repairs ) .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
Paragraph 40 ( c ) of chapter II , section D , on enhanced social protection , points to the potential resourcefulness of older persons , suggesting that particular efforts should be made towards " ensuring that older persons are able to meet their basic human needs through access to social services and social security , that those in need are assisted , that older persons are protected from abuse and violence and are treated as a resource and not a burden " .  
Because corrupt activities on the part of public officials can destroy the potential effectiveness of governmental programmes , hinder development and victimize individuals and groups , it is important that adequate criminal laws , including procedural legislation , be adopted to allow a recourse to sanctions and ensure an effective deterrence .  
Therefore , as a means of maximizing the potential for such cooperations , triangular funding arrangements buttressed by the active contribution of developed countries and relevant international organizations should be enhanced .  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization ( a ) faced a potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( b ) was potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing to , inter alia , the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( c ) faced potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops were deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
Furthermore , the practice of organizing a small group into an official unit complete with a unit chief requires careful consideration given the status associated with " bosses " , and the potential for " mini " bureaucracies to develop .  19 .  In terms of specific findings relating to these small units , electronic data-processing personnel were found to have been scattered across the Division in one or two units within each Service .  
Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .  
There is much potential for further sweeping changes and geographical shifts in the loci of production , as the developing countries adapt to technological advances , especially large countries with a latent export potential , and as the economies in transition begin to expand , especially those situated in proximity to major world markets .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
The free and orderly development of financial markets should also be promoted and mechanisms developed to bring about a more stable international financial system which would ensure that increased resources are available to its institutions and that the latter would be capable of detecting , in time , potential exchange-rate and financial crises , which negate the considerable efforts being made by our countries to achieve economic reform , liberalization and stability .  
Considering that the ultimate purpose of the State is none other than to create more equitable societies in which all members can realize their full human potential in terms of the material satisfaction of their basic needs and their intellectual and spiritual development in conditions of freedom , dignity , equality of opportunity and full respect for fundamental human rights ,  
However , since the UNDP basic needs questionnaire does not include this problem area , and countries or other entities are often unaware that this United Nations programme exists , including national planning offices charged with formalizing technical cooperation projects , its potential contribution is apt to be ignored and its inclusion in country programmes , with their competing priorities , unlikely or chancy at best .  
Though coordination has been enhanced and joint initiatives have multiplied , much still needs to be done to develop a comprehensive network of systematic relationships that will exploit the potential of this United Nations programme and its professional contributions in key areas . 
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization : ( i ) faces potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( ii ) is potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing , inter alia , to the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( iii ) faces potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops are deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .

that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
it was the economic and social marginalization of poor countries which deprived children of the right to realize their physical and intellectual potential , complete their education , find work and become well-adjusted , economically productive and socially responsible adults .  
also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
" Today , an entirely different world picture confronts us : one in which a growing convergence of interests is becoming manifest , one in which the challenge for the international community has become not the resort to the traditional and costly mechanisms of conflict resolution , which our resources can not continue to support indefinitely , but one that looks towards utilizing the vast potential of this Organization in a different approach that relies on the productivity of diplomacy in exhausting all possible avenues to settle disputes peacefully . 
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
Honduras , like all other developing countries , is deeply committed to processes designed to combat poverty and underdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its peoples and resources in order to attain speedy , fair and sustained growth , working jointly to enhance the effect of national efforts through solidarity , cooperation and mutual confidence .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
We support the efforts of the Angolan Government and the international community to undertake all tasks aimed at bringing about a lasting peace , social stability and the normal functioning of institutions at the national level , without which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy the tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they could and should benefit from , given the huge potential of their country .  
We draw the attention of the international community to the precarious situation in the region , the consequences of continued failure and the increasing possibilities of confrontation , which make it necessary for the international community to be vigilant , dynamic and strict in implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save the region from the potential scourge of war .  
The world was presented with a shocking and unfamiliar picture of my country , erasing the efforts of the national community to turn its back on its past and wiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote themselves , within the framework of their sovereign choice , to the search for the means of developing the Central African Republic , with its vast potential in mining , agriculture and livestock and with its abundant rainfall .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
We note with interest that Germany , a nation widely regarded as a potential direct beneficiary of an increase in permanent membership , put forward the idea that new permanent members should not be eternal but subject to periodic review with a 15-year interval in the form of a General Assembly vote .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
Certainly , the logic of evolution and the rules of transformation indicate that the stages of change carry within them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry , unless an objective and conducive environment exists , accompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of highly advanced values that are crystallized through coordinated and concerted efforts . 
In our view , the preliminary estimate of resources now approved has provided the Secretary-General with the potential to absorb costs , up to the level of $ 70-million , relating to new and unforeseen mandates in the area of international peace and security , which , it was intended , should be covered by the proposed contingency provision .  
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the maximum sustainable economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
Although the potential biomass resource base is immense and dedicated energy crops could add significantly to that resource base , modern , efficient use of biomass remains to be promoted and applied ; a small increase in the efficiency of burning fuelwood would have noticeable effects on carbon and particulate emissions .  
The Council acknowledged the need to facilitate access for developing countries to energy-efficient technologies and research , and called upon the international community , including developed countries , to make technologies and financial resources available to the developing countries to enable them to fully develop their potential capability in the field of new and renewable sources of energy , including their vast hydropower resources .  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
Discussing issues related to availability , accessibility and practical applications of ERS data , the participants noted , among other things , that present and potential users of the data should be more exposed to and trained in the basic sciences underlying microwave remote sensing technology , so that they could more fully benefit from the use of both the technology and the relevant data .  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;

Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
In its report to me , the team concluded that , in the current context of violence and instability , United Nations guards would not be able to guarantee the security of humanitarian personnel in Burundi ; indeed , in the present environment , the guards could themselves become potential targets for extremist groups , thus intensifying the security problems already faced by the international humanitarian effort .  
Assessments of the potential impact of variability and change of climate and the atmospheric environment were conducted by some countries through bilateral and multilateral support and as part of the UNEP-implemented World Climate Impact and Response Strategies Programme concerning areas both within and outside their national jurisdiction , including studies of vulnerability to sealevel rise , effects on agriculture , forests and other sensitive and important sectors , either as single or regional group efforts .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat organized a meeting of the Expert Group on the Identification of Principles of International Law for Sustainable Development , within the framework established by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 5 / and Agenda 21 , to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , consider possible classifications of such principles , and assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
With a view to achieving these aims , it is essential to eliminate duplication and strengthen cooperation between relevant international organizations , in particular UNCTAD , WTO and the International Trade Centre UNCTAD / GATT , in order to conserve scarce resources and make full use of the existing and potential synergies among these organizations .  Among the measures that should be considered is the establishment of a technical assistance fund administered by WTO in order to help LDCs participate actively in WTO .  
The Secretary-General 's military advisers and potential troop contributors to a renewed but significantly reduced UNMIH assessed that a contingent of 1,900 would be the minimum viable force required to accomplish UNMIH 's mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the United Nations personnel involved .  
The report drew from the deliberations of an Expert Group meeting of legal experts convened by the Division for Sustainable Development in the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat , in its capacity as task manager for chapter 39 , pursuant to the following objectives : to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , to consider possible classifications of such principles , and to assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .

Reaffirming General Assembly resolutions 50 / 173 of 22 December 1995 on the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education , 1995-2004 , and 49 / 184 of 23 December 1994 , in which the Assembly expressed the conviction that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social [ and of the right to development ] , 5 ter preambular paragraph .  
With the increasing relevance of competition policy in managing a competitive economy based on the private sector , a pressing need emerges for each country in the region to legislate viable laws governing the potential abuses of market power .  
The requested oral report on the preparation of a plan for the integration of existing information on mineral resource potential collected by the United Nations system , other organizations and Member States , on an ongoing basis so as to develop a global understanding will not be presented due to the lack of necessary resources available to prepare the plan . 
Some of the perceived potential benefits include pleasure derived directly from the psychopharmacological effects of the drug ; pleasure derived indirectly through the perceived improved performance of the individual in different contexts ; the thrill of indulging in " risky " behaviour ; and the social benefits that may be derived from being associated with a group or subculture in which illicit drugs are consumed .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
The greatest relative potential for improving efficiency exists in the developing countries , followed by the transitional economies , because of the prevalence of traditional economic patterns and inefficient energy end-use technologies in those areas .  
It decided that the basic problem of improving the capacity of those countries to capture the economic and social benefit of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session .

States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;

Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
And without belittling the value and potential of energy savings and of an expanded use of solar and wind power and biomass , I am also convinced that in the intensifying search for energy sources which produce little or no greenhouse gases , more Governments and broad segments of the general public will rediscover the nuclear power option .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .

As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
On the other hand , the Special Rapporteur is inclined to argue in favour of the proposition that treaties / agreements or constructive arrangements have the potential to become very important tools ( because of their consensual basis ) for formally establishing and implementing not only the rights and freedoms alluded to in the preceding paragraph , but also inalienable ancestral rights , in particular land rights , in the specific context of a given society .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .

It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
In the face of China 's enormous economic body , abundant resources , large labor force , and vast market , of course we can not ignore China 's competitive potential if its economic reform develops in a sustained and smooth manner .  However , Taiwan will not necessarily lose in the competition .  This is like comparing " a diamond with a tonne of cement " - - which has the greater value ?

As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States .

He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .  
Since coming to power , the Bush administration has stressed seeking " absolute security " for the US and attached importance to the " potential challenges " posed by regional powers .  Communist Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have on many occasions expressed concern in private about the Bush administration 's moves .

Now , although the profits of those big companies that prop up the US economy have declined , their overall performance is not bad and they remain very competitive internationally .  The potential for higher labor productivity driven by technological revolution will not be reversed .  This is why the performance of the " Dow Jones index , " dominated by traditional industries , betters that of the " Nasdaq index . "  
It was learned that the Beijing hierarchy believes that though potential of domestic demand remains optimistic , owing to a host of adverse factors that hamper domestic demand , the country still faces a rigorous situation in this regard .

Modern war is a huge war of attrition , and Taiwan 's limited arms will be used up very rapidly , whereas the mainland has tremendous potential for fighting a war of attrition , and this determines that Taiwan will be unable to wage protracted war with the mainland ; and given the consumption of large numbers of arms and men , Taiwan will not be able to sustain the fight for long and its armed forces will collapse .  
The fact that such a large number of world economic magnates will assemble under the banner of developing China 's vast western region suffices to prove that the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision to develop the western region is wise , well-timed , and full of great potential .

Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing .

The Chinese insistence on morality and harmony has certainly destroyed many potential happy marriages .

"  
In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species .

This role is consistent with the consensus among TCM practitioners and doctors qualified in both traditions on how Chinese and Western medicine should be used together to combat cancer .

It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
The situation is quite different in mainland China , where it is common for writers-both the famous and the unheralded-to have the same piece published some dozen times in publications large and small around the country .

Under the circumstances , the publishing industry has tremendous potential and should move in the direction of the European and American models .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
Little Li Fu-huei , barely three years old , sits on her father 's lap reciting the 3000-odd-character-long essay by Zhuangzi , " Man in the World , Associated with Other Men .

Practising a healthy lifestyle , of which sporting activities are very much a part , is of fundamental importance in the development of the physical , intellectual and emotional potential of young people in order to make them responsible adults at ease in society .  
It is hard , however , to speak about either a successful and broad application of the educational potential of sport or sporting achievements in a country where the mass aspect of sport one of its fundamental principles has been violated as a result of aggression by the neighbouring Republic of Armenia .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
Unfortunately , Ukraine does not have the potential to cover on its own the substantial expenses required to solve the set of social , economic and environmental problems connected with eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident .  
Because the sanctions regime , in practical terms , upsets the normal and balanced functioning of the economy of whole adjoining regions , undermining their entire economic infrastructure and rupturing external economic links , we need a mechanism for the careful consideration , before any decision is taken on imposing sanctions against any country , of the potential consequences of such a step both for the country targeted by the sanctions and for third countries .  
It is pertinent to indicate that the financial reforms , as the report before us notes , have so far focused almost exclusively on the formal financial sector and have neglected the informal sector with quite a vast savings potential .  
This new framework of solidarity would break with the almost exclusive , dependence on financial inflows from abroad by better exploiting the potential of trade , private investment and access to technology and reforming international financial institutions so as to better integrate them with other parts of the United Nations system and make them better suited to take care of the needs of poor countries in economic and social development .

A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Biotechnology applications have the potential for making major contributions to the health and welfare of humanity , although biotechnology is still perceived by many to have undesirable and partly unforeseeable ecological , socio-economic , legal and ethical implications .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .

Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
Replenishments in 1994 should refurbish multilateral commitment potential if the familiar cyclical pattern holds up , but if adequate funds are not forthcoming from donors , the level of the activities of the multilateral agencies could be impaired in later years .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
Strongly appeals to all women , in particular rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;

Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization ( a ) faced a potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( b ) was potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing to , inter alia , the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( c ) faced potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops were deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
Furthermore , the practice of organizing a small group into an official unit complete with a unit chief requires careful consideration given the status associated with " bosses " , and the potential for " mini " bureaucracies to develop .  19 .  In terms of specific findings relating to these small units , electronic data-processing personnel were found to have been scattered across the Division in one or two units within each Service .  
Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .

NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .

" Today , an entirely different world picture confronts us : one in which a growing convergence of interests is becoming manifest , one in which the challenge for the international community has become not the resort to the traditional and costly mechanisms of conflict resolution , which our resources can not continue to support indefinitely , but one that looks towards utilizing the vast potential of this Organization in a different approach that relies on the productivity of diplomacy in exhausting all possible avenues to settle disputes peacefully . 
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .

The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
With a view to achieving these aims , it is essential to eliminate duplication and strengthen cooperation between relevant international organizations , in particular UNCTAD , WTO and the International Trade Centre UNCTAD / GATT , in order to conserve scarce resources and make full use of the existing and potential synergies among these organizations .  Among the measures that should be considered is the establishment of a technical assistance fund administered by WTO in order to help LDCs participate actively in WTO .

Some of the perceived potential benefits include pleasure derived directly from the psychopharmacological effects of the drug ; pleasure derived indirectly through the perceived improved performance of the individual in different contexts ; the thrill of indulging in " risky " behaviour ; and the social benefits that may be derived from being associated with a group or subculture in which illicit drugs are consumed .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .

It would be preferable at this first submission stage for the coastal State to present in its package summary A4 maps 14 / indicating the approximate limits of its continental shelf , its territorial sea baselines , the general manner by which the limits were defined and any potential areas of disagreement with other States .  
ESCAP and ECLAC have agreed to cooperate in an interregional project , developed by UNCTAD and funded by UNDP , in which the two commissions will undertake studies on the prospects and potential for mutual trade and investment cooperation among their concerned members which will provide the basis for a ministerial meeting of those countries , to be organized by UNCTAD . 
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
Accordingly , with the aim of reconciling potential or actual conflicts in the event of the development of multiple uses and of providing for the optimum rational development of a common source to the benefit of each State in whose territory any part of the system is situated , it has become necessary to focus on the question of the concept of the drainage basin .  
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
The implications of the need to consider specific , national characteristics in the implementation of internationally agreed criteria and indicators are still to be clarified , especially as regards coordinated international action , comparability between countries and potential convergence , and possibilities of continuing to maintain trust and mutual acceptance among countries , international initiatives , and different interest groups .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .

Although some participants stressed the need to respond in a flexible manner to the demand for economic information for decision-making , including forecasting , others raised the potential conflict of interest in national statistical offices , first making projections and then publishing official statistics that either corroborated or invalidated their own projections .  
In general , his delegation was satisfied with the priorities identified in the Note , but agreed with other delegations that both the disarmament issue and the question of effective and coordinated response to global issues such as drugs , crime and the environment , should also be considered as potential priority areas .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .

It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
Reaffirms the great potential of technical cooperation among developing countries , which has now gained widespread acceptance as an innovative and effective instrument of technical cooperation , and urges developing countries that have not yet done so to elaborate national policies and strategies for technical cooperation among developing countries so as to give full effect to this form of cooperation ;  
It is our earnest desire to take maximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural resources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced manner with a view to creating wealth and a better future for our people .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
We have stressed on numerous occasions , including from this rostrum , that the global confrontation between two systems has given way to equally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry within them the potential for enormous destruction , thereby posing the same global challenge to international security .  
Taking full advantage of historical affinities , cultural ties and religious bonds and sparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated manner the human and natural potential and resources of the region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of security and tranquillity .  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation , were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  
The first one is that , by having established and implemented the largest compensation operation in history in record time and at minimum cost , the international community , acting through the United Nations , has confirmed the potential and capacity of the world organization to meet new and unprecedented challenges and to do it better than such operations performed outside its scope .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .  
However , the recognition by Governments and non-governmental organizations of the impact of ageing on development appears to be limited by such areas of inquiries as the potential costs of an ageing population , as measured by future costs of caring for frail older persons , future costs of pensions and the changing age structure of the workforce .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
The work of UNED-UK / United Nations Environment and Development-United Kingdom Committee and Peoples ' Forum 2001 in Japan have been recognized by other non-governmental organizations and international organizations . 18 National networks , if supported and strengthened , have the potential to be the best-placed mechanisms for follow-up to international conferences . 19 Support for national network non-governmental organizations is particularly important in the next phase of Agenda 21 follow-up , in which international conferences , which have been the traditional mobilizing factor for national networks , will be largely missing . 
Despite concerns that Internet access may be creating a new social strata of haves and have-nots , electronic communications have the potential to increase the exchange of knowledge rapidly around the world in an open , easy and relatively democratic manner , which is not only useful for linking scientists and scientific centres with each other but also for opening up available information to ordinary citizens instantly on demand , reducing their intellectual distance from scientific information .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .  
Harnessing the positive potential of development and trade is also being developed in other key areas of the Convention , such as access to genetic resources ; intellectual property rights ; technology transfer ; and social and economic incentives .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .

Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;

Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .

It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .

For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .

Given the central importance of Jerusalem to the Palestinian people , to the entire Arab and Muslim nation , to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and to the international community as a whole , the Council 's inaction stands in stark contrast to the collective position of the international community , as reflected in the Council , the great potential damage of Israel 's decision , its impact on the Middle East peace process , and the great harm wrought by the failure of the Council to adopt this draft resolution .  
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .
