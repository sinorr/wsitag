In particular , the more economically advanced developing countries are in a position to transfer to other developing countries the skills and experience , including new and innovative techniques of industrial organization and production and the creative application of technology , that have proved so successful in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of their own economies .  
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
And , despite the fact that in the past four years it was not seldom that we were the victims of historical prejudices of some policies led on the Balkans , we have proved that we are capable of enduring , as a State and as a people , with authentic national and cultural identity , with deep historical roots and our own contribution to European culture and civilization .  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
The classical codification procedure of elaborating draft articles as a basis for international diplomatic conferences , with a view to the subsequent adoption of binding instruments of international law , had been successful in the past , but of late had proved rather inflexible and should be reconsidered .

The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
The establishment of the three inter-agency task forces on basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods and the enabling environment for economic and social development has proved to be instrumental in providing United Nations system-wide support and assistance , through Resident Coordinators , to national Governments in implementing the Summit goals .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
Information , education and communication strategies that employ a multi-channel approach have proved effective , since information can be disseminated through various channels , traditional and modern , and can be packaged in various forms so as to allow both literate and illiterate audiences to understand key messages .  
Regarding the principle of complementarity , which had some bearing on the relationship between the international criminal court and national judicial systems , the statute prescribed that the court should complement national criminal justice systems in cases where national trial proceedings had proved ineffective .  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
The International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) played a relatively effective role in regulating the use of frequencies and orbits at the international level , adopting a balanced and comprehensive approach to the task that had , on the whole , proved successful in guaranteeing access to the orbit and the spectrum .

The general conclusion is that timber export taxes and bans have proved only moderately successful in achieving the desired results in South-east Asia , and in many cases they were achieved at high economic cost , in terms of both the direct costs of subsidization and the additional costs of wasteful and inefficient processing operations .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .

A strict distinction between the codification and the progressive development of international law had proved unworkable , and the Commission had rightly chosen a pragmatic approach based on a composite idea of codification and progressive development .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
The annual convening of a seminar devoted specifically to issues related to the economic and social challenges facing the Palestinian people during the transitional period has proved very useful and the Committee intends to continue this practice in order to give the international donor community , including United Nations bodies and agencies , the opportunity to exchange views with representatives of the Palestinian Authority and internationally renowned experts on relevant issues .  
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
At the beginning of the current decade , economic growth proved to be lower than projected in the baseline economic growth scenario , which was drawn up in the light of the trends observed during the period 1980-1990 and on which the traffic projections are based .

Attempts by the authorities to check the existence of these sacred sites have so far proved ineffective as a result of the shortcomings and loopholes in the laws governing the case , because some of the information held by a restricted number of women is secret and also because the information which is available can only be given to other women , which would imply that the rapporteur of the commissions of inquiry and the Minister responsible for Aboriginals to whom the report is to be submitted should be women .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
While strong interest had been expressed in raising the priority rankings of numerous activities in the programme , in view of the Organization 's present budgetary situation , particular care had been taken to counterbalance the increases in priority assigned to some activities by lowering the priorities assigned to others , although there were some cases in which this had not proved possible .  
The Kathmandu workshop proved to be a crucial turning point when , for the first time in the series of meetings , it focused on regional arrangements , explored available options , identified specific steps as building-blocks , and concluded with a clear consensus in the form of agreed workshop conclusions .  
Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective , with notable progress in the areas of joint industry / government partnerships and the development of innovative policy instruments , environmentally efficient technologies and products , and broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider community .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental . 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
Particularly in the social field , advisory services and group training proved to be the most effective means to reach local governments and grass-roots people , including the urban and rural poor , women , children , youth , the aged and the handicapped .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
Common issues mentioned in these assessments that proved problematic included electoral planning , such as unrealistic timetables , late delivery of polling materials and observers pulled out before vote counting ; insufficient concern about capacity-building , such as insufficient voter education ; and personnel and staffing issues , such as untrained or inexperienced observers .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect . 
The combination of a major issue , such as biotechnology , and a minor theme , such as agriculture , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complimentary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Despite the cross _ regional support for such a mechanism , despite the assurances that its deliberations on nuclear disarmament would not impinge on the bilateral nuclear disarmament process , despite the safeguards provided by the rule of consensus in the CD and despite a continual lowering of ambitions in relation to the scope of work on nuclear disarmament , a consensus has not so far proved attainable .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
Instead , the perception has arisen that scientists and government officials , allegedly were either directly responsible for , or else proved in league with big business , incapable of preventing , such contemporary problems as " mad cow disease " , the transatlantic dispute over beef cattle pumped full of hormones , fears about genetically modified food or the failure to find a cure for AIDS . 
Affirms that the informal consultations on measures to ensure international protection for all who need it have proved to be a valuable forum for constructive discussion of complex protection issues in an open manner ; and requests UNHCR , in consultation with States , to continue to organize from time to time , within the limits of available resources , and with broadly based participation , informal expert consultations on protection issues of current concern .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
Member States and non-governmental organizations were invited to contribute to the proposed database of good practices and lessons learned on all forms of violence against women , information on bilateral and multilateral agreements , national experiences and lessons learned , initiatives and projects that had proved viable and effective in evolving national strategies and strengthening bilateral , regional and international cooperation for dealing with violence against women migrant workers . 
Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The question of nationality was further complicated when , as a result of a succession of States , two or more legal systems collided or overlapped , and ostensibly logical and transparent criteria of nationality proved to be obscure and elusive when applied in real circumstances . 
Although Haitis partners had been very understanding , the debt relief granted had proved insufficient to free up the capital needed to finance renewed economic growth .  
The overall quality of the proposals , as compared to proposals analysed in previous funding cycles by UNFIP and the Foundation , proved to be markedly superior , reflecting a solid understanding of the framework and a genuine willingness on the part of the United Nations system to work in a joint and cohesive manner .  
At the open and public trial , televised nationwide , at which this claim was considered , it was clearly proved that the United States Government was directly responsible for this continued aggression , and that the undeclared war against Cuba had constituted an official State policy enforced by no fewer than nine successive United States Administrations over the last 40 years .  
For too many countries , the target of halving poverty by the year 2015 has proved elusive , and indeed , the President of the World Bank and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) appear to have confirmed , at their recent meeting in Washington , that the goals which the international community had set itself for such important social services as health and housing will not be fulfilled as expected .  
Acknowledging that millions of women do not have access to means that have proved effective in preventing and lowering infection rates , such as male and female condoms , anti-retroviral drugs , relevant preventive education , acceptable counselling and testing services ,  
The combination of a major development issue , such as biotechnology , with a focus approach on a specific aspect such as food production , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complementary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
An initial , simple mathematical model , based on a system of just two differential equations , proved suitable to illustrate the mechanism that can ultimately lead to a chain reaction of orbiting debris .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
During the session of the Council on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , held in May 1998 , the Council had proved that it was playing an important role in the guidance and oversight of its subsidiary bodies ; it had identified , inter alia , poverty eradication as the overriding objective of its efforts and had recognized the need to address the problem of declining resources for the implementation of conferences .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation the affirmative action that might have been adopted to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and it is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .  
This decentralized form of government has increased administration at the local level and proved to be the ideal way to ensure political participation from the grassroots to the uppermost levels .  
In the establishment of ad hoc international tribunals or special courts operating as separate institutions , independently of the relevant national legal system , it has proved to be necessary to comprise within one and the same entity all three organs .  
In addition to using rubbercoated metal bullets , which at close range have proved lethal , troops have fired rifles and machine guns , deployed tanks , fired rockets and antitank missiles , and have employed and fired from helicopter gunships and naval vessels .  
That crisis had come as a severe shock after years of rapid growth , and had proved that no country was immune to the contagious consequences of global financial market instability , whatever the strength of its economy or its level of economic growth .  
In addition , a straight compilation of country data for 150 key variables from the customary international sources proved to be unusable because of inconsistencies , errors and incompatibility between global sets and nationally acknowledged data .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
The second week proved easier in terms of interpretation content and workload ( meetings started late , finished early or were interrupted and the Commission on Sustainable Development cancelled one meeting and devoted another one to informal drafting work without interpretation ) .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
Since then , the format of combining plenary debate in which delegations state their national positions , with ministerial round tables and informal panels , inter alia , with the participation of non-governmental actors , has proved its value for facilitating interactive dialogues among all key actors in development . 
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
The introduction of the staff member pay control mechanisms based on automatic updates of staff member entitlements proved to be more complex than had been foreseen and required extensive monitoring , troubleshooting , analysis and prompt resolution of critical problems .  
All state representatives at the Tunis Summit claimed that this plan proved the countries ' commitment to pursue and strengthen political , economic , social , and educational reforms .  However , these reforms had to be carried out according to the national conditions , cultural backgrounds , religious beliefs , and the possible extent of change of individual states to silently resist the U.S . intention of forcing the Arab states into carrying out political and economic reforms by means foreign to the Arabs .  
The White Paper " The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue " has expounded and proved the facts and legal basis of one China , elaborated the emergence and basic meanings of the one-China principle , emphasized that the one-China principle is the basis and prerequisite for the realization of peaceful reunification , expressed the Chinese Government 's attitude of resolutely defending the one-China principle , and explained the propositions on several issues in the cross-strait relations involving the one-China principle and the adherence to the one-China principle in the international community .  
Practice over the past five years has proved clearly that President Jiang 's eight-point proposal is a powerful weapon for opposing attempts to split the motherland and for crushing forces advocating " Taiwan independence " ; a banner for uniting all the descendants of the Chinese nation both at home and abroad , who have an ardent wish for a national rejuvenation , to make a common effort for the reunification of their country ; and a rational and pragmatic way for bringing about stable growth in cross-strait relations .  
He said : Practice has proved that the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is indeed a wise choice of historical significance [ li shi xing de zheng que jue ze 2980-0670-1840-4104-2973-4292-2115-2344 ] .  In the new millennium and the new century , the two sides should take a long view and become good neighbors , good partners , and good friends who trust each other , engage in cooperation , and pursue common development .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
For the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .  Despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .  At the same time , he trained his key members to establish a compact organizational setup and he himself sat in a leading position and gave remote controls and commands .  
During the meeting , Qian Qichen pointed out that since Hong Kong 's return to the motherland , facts have proved that the " one country , two systems " principle put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is no longer an tentative idea but a reality .  Hong Kong has continued to practice its original social system and ways of living and has maintained stability and prosperity .  
Meanwhile , we should also see that the satisfactory economic efficiency attained by state enterprises last year was closely linked with the policy support of the state , besides the hard efforts made by the enterprises .  This year , however , the space for increasing profits through the policy factor is limited , and the task of realizing the three-year target for reform and the difficulty relief of state enterprises has therefore proved extremely arduous .

The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
The establishment of the three inter-agency task forces on basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods and the enabling environment for economic and social development has proved to be instrumental in providing United Nations system-wide support and assistance , through Resident Coordinators , to national Governments in implementing the Summit goals .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
Information , education and communication strategies that employ a multi-channel approach have proved effective , since information can be disseminated through various channels , traditional and modern , and can be packaged in various forms so as to allow both literate and illiterate audiences to understand key messages .  
Regarding the principle of complementarity , which had some bearing on the relationship between the international criminal court and national judicial systems , the statute prescribed that the court should complement national criminal justice systems in cases where national trial proceedings had proved ineffective .  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
The International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) played a relatively effective role in regulating the use of frequencies and orbits at the international level , adopting a balanced and comprehensive approach to the task that had , on the whole , proved successful in guaranteeing access to the orbit and the spectrum .  
A confession or admission by a suspect given during questioning by national authorities shall , provided the relevant requirements of the Statute and the Rules were strictly complied with , be presumed to have been free and voluntary unless the contrary is proved .  
The Group considered that the exploration plan as developed in its report would be completed at the same time that mining and processing technology were tested and considered appropriate , adequate mine sites identified , the market environment proved attractive for investment , and when a decision to proceed to a feasibility study would have to be taken . 
The general conclusion is that timber export taxes and bans have proved only moderately successful in achieving the desired results in South-east Asia , and in many cases they were achieved at high economic cost , in terms of both the direct costs of subsidization and the additional costs of wasteful and inefficient processing operations .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
Bearing in mind that Western media allegations of Libyan terrorism had proved false , his delegation joined with those which had stressed the need to draw up a code of conduct concerning the media and information with a view to reinforcing the ground rules for fairness and impartiality and respect for the choices of peoples relating to lifestyle and to political , economic , social and cultural development .  
A strict distinction between the codification and the progressive development of international law had proved unworkable , and the Commission had rightly chosen a pragmatic approach based on a composite idea of codification and progressive development .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
The annual convening of a seminar devoted specifically to issues related to the economic and social challenges facing the Palestinian people during the transitional period has proved very useful and the Committee intends to continue this practice in order to give the international donor community , including United Nations bodies and agencies , the opportunity to exchange views with representatives of the Palestinian Authority and internationally renowned experts on relevant issues .  
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
At the beginning of the current decade , economic growth proved to be lower than projected in the baseline economic growth scenario , which was drawn up in the light of the trends observed during the period 1980-1990 and on which the traffic projections are based .  
The Slovak party has informed representatives of the Commission of the European Union as well as the States members of the latter on all legislative , legal and internal political aspects relating to the preparation and subsequent conduct of the referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , including the fourth question on direct presidential elections which proved to be invalid from the legislative point of view .  
Attempts by the authorities to check the existence of these sacred sites have so far proved ineffective as a result of the shortcomings and loopholes in the laws governing the case , because some of the information held by a restricted number of women is secret and also because the information which is available can only be given to other women , which would imply that the rapporteur of the commissions of inquiry and the Minister responsible for Aboriginals to whom the report is to be submitted should be women .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
While strong interest had been expressed in raising the priority rankings of numerous activities in the programme , in view of the Organization 's present budgetary situation , particular care had been taken to counterbalance the increases in priority assigned to some activities by lowering the priorities assigned to others , although there were some cases in which this had not proved possible .  
The Kathmandu workshop proved to be a crucial turning point when , for the first time in the series of meetings , it focused on regional arrangements , explored available options , identified specific steps as building-blocks , and concluded with a clear consensus in the form of agreed workshop conclusions .  
Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective , with notable progress in the areas of joint industry / government partnerships and the development of innovative policy instruments , environmentally efficient technologies and products , and broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider community .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental . 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
Particularly in the social field , advisory services and group training proved to be the most effective means to reach local governments and grass-roots people , including the urban and rural poor , women , children , youth , the aged and the handicapped .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
Common issues mentioned in these assessments that proved problematic included electoral planning , such as unrealistic timetables , late delivery of polling materials and observers pulled out before vote counting ; insufficient concern about capacity-building , such as insufficient voter education ; and personnel and staffing issues , such as untrained or inexperienced observers .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect . 
The combination of a major issue , such as biotechnology , and a minor theme , such as agriculture , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complimentary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Despite the cross _ regional support for such a mechanism , despite the assurances that its deliberations on nuclear disarmament would not impinge on the bilateral nuclear disarmament process , despite the safeguards provided by the rule of consensus in the CD and despite a continual lowering of ambitions in relation to the scope of work on nuclear disarmament , a consensus has not so far proved attainable .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
Instead , the perception has arisen that scientists and government officials , allegedly were either directly responsible for , or else proved in league with big business , incapable of preventing , such contemporary problems as " mad cow disease " , the transatlantic dispute over beef cattle pumped full of hormones , fears about genetically modified food or the failure to find a cure for AIDS . 
Affirms that the informal consultations on measures to ensure international protection for all who need it have proved to be a valuable forum for constructive discussion of complex protection issues in an open manner ; and requests UNHCR , in consultation with States , to continue to organize from time to time , within the limits of available resources , and with broadly based participation , informal expert consultations on protection issues of current concern .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
Member States and non-governmental organizations were invited to contribute to the proposed database of good practices and lessons learned on all forms of violence against women , information on bilateral and multilateral agreements , national experiences and lessons learned , initiatives and projects that had proved viable and effective in evolving national strategies and strengthening bilateral , regional and international cooperation for dealing with violence against women migrant workers . 
Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The question of nationality was further complicated when , as a result of a succession of States , two or more legal systems collided or overlapped , and ostensibly logical and transparent criteria of nationality proved to be obscure and elusive when applied in real circumstances . 
Although Haitis partners had been very understanding , the debt relief granted had proved insufficient to free up the capital needed to finance renewed economic growth .  
The overall quality of the proposals , as compared to proposals analysed in previous funding cycles by UNFIP and the Foundation , proved to be markedly superior , reflecting a solid understanding of the framework and a genuine willingness on the part of the United Nations system to work in a joint and cohesive manner .  
At the open and public trial , televised nationwide , at which this claim was considered , it was clearly proved that the United States Government was directly responsible for this continued aggression , and that the undeclared war against Cuba had constituted an official State policy enforced by no fewer than nine successive United States Administrations over the last 40 years .  
For too many countries , the target of halving poverty by the year 2015 has proved elusive , and indeed , the President of the World Bank and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) appear to have confirmed , at their recent meeting in Washington , that the goals which the international community had set itself for such important social services as health and housing will not be fulfilled as expected .  
Acknowledging that millions of women do not have access to means that have proved effective in preventing and lowering infection rates , such as male and female condoms , anti-retroviral drugs , relevant preventive education , acceptable counselling and testing services ,  
The combination of a major development issue , such as biotechnology , with a focus approach on a specific aspect such as food production , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complementary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
An initial , simple mathematical model , based on a system of just two differential equations , proved suitable to illustrate the mechanism that can ultimately lead to a chain reaction of orbiting debris .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
During the session of the Council on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , held in May 1998 , the Council had proved that it was playing an important role in the guidance and oversight of its subsidiary bodies ; it had identified , inter alia , poverty eradication as the overriding objective of its efforts and had recognized the need to address the problem of declining resources for the implementation of conferences .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation the affirmative action that might have been adopted to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and it is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .  
This decentralized form of government has increased administration at the local level and proved to be the ideal way to ensure political participation from the grassroots to the uppermost levels .  
In the establishment of ad hoc international tribunals or special courts operating as separate institutions , independently of the relevant national legal system , it has proved to be necessary to comprise within one and the same entity all three organs .  
In addition to using rubbercoated metal bullets , which at close range have proved lethal , troops have fired rifles and machine guns , deployed tanks , fired rockets and antitank missiles , and have employed and fired from helicopter gunships and naval vessels .  
That crisis had come as a severe shock after years of rapid growth , and had proved that no country was immune to the contagious consequences of global financial market instability , whatever the strength of its economy or its level of economic growth .  
In addition , a straight compilation of country data for 150 key variables from the customary international sources proved to be unusable because of inconsistencies , errors and incompatibility between global sets and nationally acknowledged data .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
The second week proved easier in terms of interpretation content and workload ( meetings started late , finished early or were interrupted and the Commission on Sustainable Development cancelled one meeting and devoted another one to informal drafting work without interpretation ) .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
Since then , the format of combining plenary debate in which delegations state their national positions , with ministerial round tables and informal panels , inter alia , with the participation of non-governmental actors , has proved its value for facilitating interactive dialogues among all key actors in development . 
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
The introduction of the staff member pay control mechanisms based on automatic updates of staff member entitlements proved to be more complex than had been foreseen and required extensive monitoring , troubleshooting , analysis and prompt resolution of critical problems .
