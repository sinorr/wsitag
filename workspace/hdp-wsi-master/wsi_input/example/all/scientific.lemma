We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
The regiment commander took his staff officers in charge of training to the company where they set up a group to tackle training bottlenecks with regard to the new equipment .  The group was formed by three platoon leaders , who had just been assigned to the company by a military academy , as well as some of the company 's backbone training personnel known for better education .  After working hard for two months , the group compiled a user-friendly training program and some teaching materials complete with detailed contents and scientific standards .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .  
In today 's world , where economic globalization is making rapid development , scientific and technological progress is changing everyday , and countries are intensifying their competition to raise comprehensive national strength , it is particularly important to stir up and encourage the national innovative spirit .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
We must strengthen our efforts to cut off the supply of illegal drugs in Yunnan , Guangxi , and other border areas in China 's southwest , northwest , and northeast regions as well as in the southeast coastal region by increasing the use of scientific and technological equipment , intensifying investigation and arrests , firmly stopping the influx of illegal drugs , and strictly preventing the flow of precursor chemicals out of the restricted areas .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
At 10:20 , the command center received from higher levels " an order of recruiting specialized technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment to support the front " .  It immediately started the plan for recruiting technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment from the national defense mobilization database and transmitted the plan to the various command sub-centers for scientific and technological mobilization .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
On site , the writer saw a series of situations being sent to the directorial center in real time and promptly .  They included whether the commanders could rapidly and accurately make judgments on enemy situations , whether they could make scientific decisions , whether instructions could be sent to affiliated combat troops amid electronic interference , whether troops could trust deep into the enemy force and take up position as scheduled and according to instructions , and whether information on the enemy could be handled effectively .  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
The units involved have summed up and popularized the achievements that the army has made in scientific and technological troops training in recent years .  Through repeated attempts for improvement , innovation , and development , they have eventually solved knotty problems that have puzzled the army for a long time regarding operations under future hi-tech conditions .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
The Bayi Men 's Basketball Team has defeated its competitors in consecutive games and has won games one after the other because the team - consistently aiming for first-class quality in their play is consistent and strict in managing the team , applies scientific theories to training , constantly perfecting the skills of every player , does not consider losses for and gains to individuals and relies on teamwork for victories .  Unity leads to combat strength and industrious training leads to excellent soldiers .  
In today 's world , the scientific and technological revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds , a knowledge economy is rising rapidly , economic globalization is currently undergoing an increasingly accelerated process , and competition in comprehensive national strength is becoming more and more acute .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
" fundamental " means that once the scientific method is established , it will become the soul of the individual , the nation and the people .  It will stimulate the people to love life , to pursue truth , and to be intelligent and sharp , to be fair and unselfish , to be self-confident , not cocky , to be rigorous , not picky , to be upright and outspoken , calm and unhurried , to be filled with the spirit of creativity and creative vitality .  
Raising the scientific and cultural level of all the people is a huge systematic undertaking , one which requires painstaking planning and organization , and one which can not be left unemphasized , nor worse yet bogged down with the usual sighs of emotion .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
clearly defined the relevant study tasks and targets ; organized officers and men to study electronics science , microelectronics science , photoelectron science and other modern scientific and technological know-how ; and laid a solid knowledge foundation for mastering new equipment , and conducting exercises on new subjects .  
closely center our efforts around the need to enhance our ability of " winning the war " ; conscientiously summarize the practical experiences of the troops ; and strive to create flexible and diversified methods of operation , intensive and highly efficient methods of training , and scientific and standardized methods of management .  
Due to the prompt action taken in education and effective measures implemented , everyone maintained a healthy psychological attitude on the scientific knowledge in highland .  While not fearing the highland , they adopted a serious attitude to counter the problems on highland .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
We must ensure first that they are qualified in the political sense , and second in a scientific and cultural sense , in professional skills and capacities and also in physical and psychological health .  We must further ensure that these experts have acquired comprehensive knowledge in various fields , overall coordination abilities , an innovative spirit as well as innovative capacities .  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
The new leading body of the Beijing Military Representatives Bureau conducted in-depth investigation and held a " forum on weaponry development " in late August with the participation of leaders and relevant experts from the offices of science , technology and industry for national defense , in five provinces and cities in northern China , all military enterprises , and military representatives offices stationed in various enterprises and jointly discussed plans with them on scientific research and development of military products .  
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
The fact that Cheng Kejie committed serious crimes once again showed that it is of critical importance to establish and perfect a whole set of scientific and rational mechanisms with binding force for management and supervising leading cadres in preventing and checking corruption .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
These heroic units have demonstrated their new graceful bearing in operating new equipment and applying new technology in scientific and technological military training .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
The PLA 's success in carrying out the activities of exchanging successful experience of scientific and technological military training will yield an important effect on furthering the scientific and technological military training .  The participants in the activities included the leaders in charge of training and education of major participating units ; the leaders of the air force , naval fleets and second artillery bases under various military regions ;  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
Zhang Shiming , who has been engaged in long-term research on innovative utilization of straw , believes that it is still necessary at present to accelerate the implementation of strengthening the country through science and education , the development of science , and increasing the scientific level of the entire nation .  In this way , it will enable the broad masses of the people to enhance their abilities to ward off the disturbance and destruction caused by the evil cult organization of " Falungong " .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
When one lacks a skeptical critical spirit and reveres all existing understanding as the absolute , the road to scientific progress , passing , breaking new ground , and innovation would be blocked .  
New scientific theories are the results of summarizing newly verified scientific facts , but we can not ignore the original verified scientific facts ( unless we can scientifically verify that the original beliefs were neither complete nor accurate ) .  We can not repudiate all the scientific content in the original theories that have been scientifically tested .  The evolution of old theories into new theories is not a matter of total repudiation .  
To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Therefore , the two sides will continue maintaining the momentum of high-level intercourse and contacts , deepening the mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological realms , strengthening the omni-directional exchange and cooperation in all realms , and improve the communication and coordination in international and regional affairs .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
Today , the tidal waves of a new scientific and technological revolution marked by the universal application of information technologies are sweeping across the globe with great momentum , and the trend of accelerated reorganization of the world economic structure is increasingly prominent .  
In addition to continuously taking readers ' requirements into first consideration and regarding scientific ways of health preservation and health care as main contents , this section will add some relevant new columns , such as self-treatment of diseases , miraculous ways for long life , origins of human relations , Doctor Feng 's mailbox , weekly medicated food , the quickest way for improving one 's looks , psychology hotlines , and new medical findings .  
At the same time , in innovating training methods and means , it is necessary to adhere to a scientific truth-seeking attitude , prevent and overcome the unrealistic practice of going in for grandiose projects and things foreign , the practice of seeking novelty and surprise without paying attention to practical results , and the practice of being overanxious for quick results , a practice that runs counter to laws .  
Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
promoting the economic , educational , scientific , and cultural cooperation and interchange between Macao and the inland , connecting people from all circles of Macao , improving the association between Macao and the inland , reflecting the opinions that Macao residents have to the inland , managing the related Taiwan affairs , undertaking other matters that the central government hands over . 
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Although many things in Western economic theories reflect the common regularity in mass production and market operation in an era of scientific and technological revolution , being the reflection of the basic economic relations in capitalist society , in essence , such theories just embody the requirements of the capitalist economic system in its contemporary development .  
Therefore , a large portion of the US ' scientific research capability is focused in private departments , university / technical schools , and scientific research centers relying on Department of Defense funds .  They have strong executive mechanisms which organize and maintain a tight relationship between the " procurer " and research center .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
These leaders and institutions should make full use of every modern news media to propagate the grand prospects of our military modernization project in an effort to attract more outstanding scientific and technological specialists who must be patriotic and determined to strengthen the motherland so that these talented individuals can achieve merit in their military careers .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
As a vice president and the chief designer of China 's Research Institute of Air-to-Air Missiles , he took charge of and gave direct leadership to scientific and technological personnel designing and finalizing many types of air-to-air missiles , thus making the our country 's research and development of air-to-air missiles climb onto one new stage after another from starting from scratch to copying and self-designing and until reaching the international advanced level .  
On the basis of analyzing these broken fragments , Dong Bingyin led the scientific and technological personnel in dissecting the generator laden with explosives at the risk of their life for a year .  Through conducting nearly 100 major and minor tests and obtaining up to 1,000 data entries , he finally proved that it was the interference of the missile holder which caused the incident , thus paving the way for resuming the range test .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
According to what has been disclosed by a relevant department today , ever since the state started its " 863 Program " 15 years ago , nearly 10,000 scientific and technological personnel from the army have successively plunged themselves into the research work .  Displaying their outstanding ability and talents to the fullest in high technological fields , they have attained a series of major scientific and technological achievements .  
Groups of scientific and technological personnel , consisting mainly of the academicians of the two academies of sciences , experts , and professors , have successively completed some 1,500 research topics ; made breakthroughs on more than 100 major and key technologies ; won 397 Awards for Scientific and Technological Progress at both the national level and the ministerial-commission level , as well as 137 state patents for invention ;  
During the process of completing the " 863 " research topics , the scientific and technological personnel throughout the army as well as scientific research administrations at all levels have also carried out bold practices in the field of high-tech management .  Today , they have opened up a new path for high-tech research and development which requires less input but can yield a higher economic efficiency , and have laid a solid foundation for a sustainable development in the future .  
It was with the spirit of facing the gap , being unwilling to lag behind , striving to catch up with developed countries , being independent and innovative and consistently assailing scientific heights which is upheld by the majority of scientific and technological workers that enabled us to gain our precious foothold in the extraordinarily fierce high-tech competition .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
In October 1990 , the DPRK government recruited many outstanding scientific research personnel from all scientific research academies and institutes nationwide , put in huge funds , and organized and established formally the " DPRK Computer Center " in Pyongyang , which was equipped with various types of advanced facilities , and is fully responsible for the development and application of computer technology and the work of popularizing computer knowledge nationwide .  
At the same time , with rapid scientific and technological development , the growing dominance of the knowledge economy and network economy in social and economic development , and continual acceleration of economic globalization , the contests of scientific and technological , economic , and comprehensive national capabilities are becoming increasingly fierce .  
They should train and bring up a contingent of high-quality leaders of different types at various levels who are firm in their political stand , manifest new pioneering spirit and possess modern scientific , educational and managerial knowledge as well as a contingent of specialty technicians and economic managerial personnel urgently needed in our region .  
They have achieved marked S &amp; T troop training results , sharply cultivating high-quality military talent , daring to reform and innovate , adhering to scientific objectivity , reforming training content , improving training methods , and creating innovative training means , to have made a prominent contribution to the in-depth development of S &amp; T troop training throughout the PLA .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .  Over the past five years , various major units , academies , or schools charged with the task of building key projects have persistently followed a correct direction ;  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Ideological and political building has been further enhanced , preparations for military struggle have been thorough and sound , notable success has been achieved in national defense scientific research and armament modernization , all-round backup capability has been markedly strengthened , and there has been a very big improvement in the army 's all-round combat capability in hi-tech conditions .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?  Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
( 3 ) Proceeding from the realities in the country and in the armed forces ; drawing upon beneficial experiences from foreign forces ; emancipating the mind ; seeking truth from facts ; boldly furthering explorations ; bravely blazing new trails ; comprehensively adopting modern scientific methods or means ; and developing a military theory with Chinese characteristics .  
After receiving the application from the leader of a topic group , a military scientific research management department of an individual unit may make a plan for appraising , testing , or accepting the relevant research results before sending personnel to do the work and shall submit in a timely fashion a report to a military scientific research management department at a higher level after deeming a research topic suitable for listing in a military scientific research plan for a unit at a higher level .  
Article 36 All units shall support mass activities of military scientific research ; urge or encourage personnel with research capabilities to conduct military scientific research in light of their work ; train or foster backbone personnel for academic research ; or make things convenient or create conditions for the personnel concerned to conduct research .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
This university regarded this project as its key scientific research task , put in several hundred-thousand yuan to carry out research and development , and directly applied several major scientific research findings to transforming the existing weapons .  Through nearly two years of painstaking efforts to do research and to tackle problems , finally , this university successfully fulfilled the artillery digital transformation task , thus effectively enhancing the tactical and technical performances of towed artillery .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
" Substantial Increase " in Three Areas ; Solid Foundation for Rejuvenating the Country Through Science and TechnologyThe Outline sets forth the main anticipated targets for scientific and technological and educational development as follows : By 2005 , the proportion of research and development funds of entire society held in the GDP will be raised to 1.5 percent or more ; the achievements in basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education will be further consolidated ; 
- - Zhang Xudong , a master 's -degree captain who returned after studying abroad , introduced a foreign " 1000-score rating system for vessel management " to his warship .  The system has substantially enhanced vessel and equipment management , effecting a significant qualitative change based on bit-by-bit quantitative changes , thus paving the way for scientific management .  
During a major contest organized by their fleet to review scientific and technological training , Zhang and his crew won first place in 14 single categories and became the champion of the whole contest .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
In the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , marked results were achieved in the archive work of our army : In the whole army , an integrated military archive system with full categories , reasonable structure , scientific management , good facilities , and efficient services was set up basically .  Corresponding rules and regulations for archive building and management were also formulated and improved .  A batch of high-quality archive management software was developed .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
Zhang Yingying , a student of the English Department , said that contemporary university students should keep themselves sober-headed , resolutely support the solemn and just position of the Chinese Government , proficiently master scientific and general knowledge , make preparations for participating in our country 's economic construction and national defense construction , and enhance our country 's comprehensive national strength and international influence .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
The mass media carries important responsibility in literary and artistic criticism ; it must propagate scientific theory and advanced culture , mold a good spirit , magnify a healthy social atmosphere , and promote scientific spirit to create a good environment for public opinion in developing flourishing literary creations .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .  
We are willing to strive hard , together with all countries in the world , for the institution of a fair and rational intellectual property system favorable to promoting scientific and technological as well as economic development in various countries , and for the creation of a fine environment of respecting knowledge , advocating science , and protecting intellectual property rights for all humanity .  
On the one hand , this reflects the serious harm created when " Falungong " followers practice spirit control .  On the other hand , it reflects the results of relaxed education , including correct ideological and scientific education , not interfering with feudal ignorance , and the spreading of backward and corrupt things .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
First , with regard to assuring the requirements of monetary policy and financial supervision and control and raising the level at which duties and responsibilities are carried out according to law , the bank has established scientific , highly effective systems for financial statistics and for off-site management and control . 
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
The standard attained by a country 's universities reflects from one aspect the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and is also a major expression of the country 's all-round national strength .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
The exhibition reflected Tsinghua 's major scientific and technological innovations as well as the achievements attained in the tackling of major technological hurdles , basic research , and technological research for national defense .  The fields involved information , nuclear energy and technology , life science and technology , new materials , energy and environment , and advanced manufacturing .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin listened in detail to the account given by President Wang Dazhong . With great interest , Jiang saw the digital television launching and receiving system and the special chips used for the system with China 's own intellectual property rights , the 500-meter-long high temperature superconductor material , biological material , and other products .  He also asked about the scientific research network for China 's education , application of low temperature heat reactors , and optical communications .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The level attained by the universities of a country actually reflects the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and this is also a major embodiment of this country 's comprehensive national strength .  The building of first-class universities attaining the world 's advanced level in our country will require great support from the party , the government , and all social circles ;  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .  This reform of drawing up the armed forces budget is a key step in this process .  
He pointed out that biotechnology is a critical area that will have bearing on national development in the 21st century , and it is also a new growth point for economic development , so we must concentrate our strengths and tackle key problems , accelerating the effort to come up with a group of scientific research achievements at advanced world levels and also speeding up the pace at which scientific research is transformed into results and becomes industrialized .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
For example , we can make use of advanced scientific and technological means to establish an appraisal and evaluation system composed of different quality indexes , which can integrate qualitative assessment with quantitative analysis and can link the appraisal made by party organizations with the evaluation conducted by the masses ; enhance the accuracy and rationality of our selection and our use of cadres ; and minimize the adverse influences that may be produced by man-made factors .  
Those who have attained extraordinary work results , have given an outstanding work performance , have made great contributions , and have shown a strong work ability shall be promoted to higher posts either ahead of time or overstepping their proper ranks ; and those who have achieved major scientific research results or have considerably enhanced the military efficiency shall be amply rewarded .  
With the scientific and technological progress and the development of modern education , peasants can master better work skills and richer scientific and general knowledge .  This will provide a major driving force for changing the structure of agriculture and the rural economy .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Third , we should tighten the efforts in compiling the needed teaching materials , and work as quickly as possible to come up with well-compiled teaching materials suitable for different types of cadres to study .  We should make earnest efforts to address the existing problems found in our teaching materials - - such problems as they are not systematic or relevant , and they have only " one size that fits all . "  We should tighten centralized planning and set up a scientific and rational system of compiling teaching materials for the training of cadres .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
The northwest region of Shaanxi , Gansu , Ningxia , Qinghai , and Xinjiang has a vast territory , a large number of high scientific and technological personnel , and economic characteristics , and the combination of Hong Kong 's funds with the achievements in high science and technology in these areas will turn out to be a big fortune .  What is more , the rich resources there are buried treasures pending development .  
We must provide scientific , safe , convenient and effective birth control services to the wide masses of child-bearing age , thoroughly set up technological service networks for family planning , pay close attention to strengthening the construction of technological service networks in farming and animal husbandry zones , and make efforts to enhance service capacity .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
Asia and Europe are also known for superior economic , scientific , and technological strength , rich human resources , and vast markets which can not be found elsewhere , and this has provided a sound basis for the two sides to strengthen bilateral cooperation .  
We should work out long-term plans for cooperation in accordance with the principle of ensuring mutual benefit and drawing upon each other 's strong points , explore effective concrete measures to this end , and deepen in an all-round way bilateral cooperation and exchanges in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , educational , environmental , and other fields in order to constantly widen the road of Asian-European cooperation and make fresh headway in this direction . 
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
The key to prevailing in warfare will be people 's level of scientific and cultural knowledge .  Without a solid foundation in science and culture , there will be no excellent art of commanding to speak of .  
The weakness in scientific and cultural knowledge has become a " bottleneck " constraining improvement in cadres ' comprehensive quality .  To break this " bottleneck , " it is now urgent to raise cadres ' knowledge level as soon as possible .  Work hard to achieve a big leaping rise in cadres ' knowledge level shortly through efforts to make cadres have advanced schooling .  
A : China-Venezuela relations have been developing well in recent years .  The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
Bian Jiagui , deputy director of the Beijing Garrison Command 's Political Department , said that extraordinarily rapid scientific and technological development throughout the world is embodied not only in economic fields but also in military fields .  Military cadres should devote greater efforts to delving into science and technology and continuously improve their abilities in every field .  Only in this way can military cadres set up a solid foundation for being competitive in the non-military sectors after their demobilization .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
They won 8 medals for achievements in special military skills competition and in " " revolutionization , modernization , regularization " , meritorious service reward for 51 man-times , and two distinguished honors of winning the titles of " advanced regiment in scientific and technological training " and " advanced regiment in overall construction " .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
The brigade 's new equipment is technology intensive and requires complicated operations .  In connection with this reality , the brigade made the training of a contingent of personnel capable of tackling key scientific and technological problems a core issue in resolving training problems and the improvement of quality and performance an important way to shortening the cycle for transforming new equipment into combat strength .  
To this end , while making efforts to build the command , operation , and technical contingents and in connection with its efforts to tackle key scientific and technological problems in equipment development and training reform , it actively encouraged cadres having development potentials to attend academic symposiums and research results reviewing conferences sponsored by the superior organs , research units , and colleges and schools in an effort to broaden their vision and enable them to have unclogged access to information .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
The officers and men have based themselves on their own positions and engaged in scientific research .  Through repeated exploration and improvement , they have finally developed a new model of special power distribution equipment with multiple supplies and functions .  
Besides such advantages as having a reasonable design , exhaustive functions , and being easy to operate and safe and reliable , this type of power distribution equipment can save more than 200,000 yuan of the yearly equipment expense for the unit .  The equipment has won the third prize of national patent and scientific and technological advancement in the whole army .  
With the coming of the new century , we ardently wish that Guangzhou and Tibet will walk to hand in hand even more closely , further strengthen and deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the economic , technical , scientific , educational , cultural , travel , and other areas , that they will continually create new forms of cooperation , expand the areas of cooperation , mutually use their strong points to compensate for weaknesses , and move forward shoulder to shoulder .  
Meanwhile , a number of transportation projects were completed one after another , including the Dalian-Qinhuangdao railway , China 's first electrified coal-transporting railroad , and the Changyuan Dongming railroad bridge , the longest such bridge in Asia . The completion of a number of large cutting-edge scientific research projects which meet advanced international standards , such as the positive-negative electronic collider , heavy ion accelerator , and national radiation laboratory , has demonstrated China 's scientific and technological ( S &amp; T ) prowess .  
Second , we should bring the role of universities and scientific research institutes into full play , make great efforts to carry out strategic advanced technology research and creative and basic research .  We should enhance our sustained innovation capability in science and technology .  We should strive to realize rapid development in technology in the domain that we have relative advantages or in the domain that is strategically important .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
Scientists and technologists are the valuable wealth of the Party and the state .  In the world today , the core of competition for comprehensive national strength is competition in science and technology , and the core of competition in science and technology is a contest for scientific and technological talents .  Implementation of the strategy for reinvigorating the country through science and education has set up a wide stage for China 's scientific and technological workers to serve the motherland and has created an unprecedented , favorable environment .  
He stressed China must sensitively keep pace with the general trend of the current scientific-technological development , fully assess the great significance of future scientific-technological development to human society , heighten their sense of urgency and , taking into consideration of the actual needs of China 's development , act immediately to catch up with the world 's advanced scientific and technological research and press forward to create a new situation for China 's thriving scientific-technological development .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
This is not only a good method of resolving the issue of a lack of funds , but will also bring in professional human resources , information , advanced technology and management expertise , and scientific marketing networks .  This will promote the enhancement of local products ' quality and the local enterprises ' competitive power in the international market , and will thus bring great benefits to the economic development in the western areas .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
Wen Jiabao required that the sixth national committee of the association continue to deepen reforms and expand the new scope of work on the basis of previous achievements , further the efforts of making the association a main channel for academic exchanges and scientific knowledge popularization , make the association a main representative of China in international non-official scientific and technological exchanges , build up the image as the " home of scientists and technologists , " and promote the development of its work in all fields .  
She has attached importance to basic clinical nursing and management quality , as well as to nursing scientific research , thus making prominent contributions to raising the level of nursing work and to training nurses .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
He has repeatedly pointed out : Our propaganda and ideological front is a very important front because it concerns the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  We should persist in arming people with scientific theories , guiding people with correct public opinions , molding people with a noble spirit and encouraging people with outstanding art and literature works .  
Liu Yunshan stressed : Over the past 80 years , our party has united with and rallied millions upon millions of people not only with scientific theories , correct line and magnificent goals , but also with the dynamic ethical character and moral integrity of the Communists . Since reform and opening up , and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress in particular , the CPC Central Committee has persisted in taking economic construction as the center .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .  
the basic network , scientific research and production , and information service will fully meet the requirements of national economic and social development and national defense construction and will rank among the most advanced countries in the world , providing comprehensive information technology and equipment support and basic networking safeguards for reform , opening up , and modernization . 
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
We must earnestly carry out the strategy of vitalizing Tibet through scientific education , spare no effort to cultivate all sorts of skilled personnel , do our best to promote progress and creation in science and technology , and make great effort to adopt advanced and applicable technology so as to give better play to the role of modern science and technology in the progress of economic development .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .  
With the development of reform , opening up , and modernization , the Chinese working class has expanded steadily .  The quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of their political awareness , moral standards , scientific and technical and educational level .  It has become more progressive .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
At today 's forum of the General Armament Party Secretariat , Cao Gangchuan , member of the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) and Director of the PLA General Armament Department , pointed out that General Secretary Jiang 's major address commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Party is a Marxist programmatic document , a new and glorious procedural scientific guide for overall advancement of building the Party under the new circumstances , and a great ideological weapon for guiding the entire Party in the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It will guarantee the satisfactory fulfillment of our major scientific research and experiment mission , guarantee the safety and stability of the armed forces .  It is a realistic test of our study and implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech , and balance every level of Party committee and leadership levels with the basic standards for official achievements .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech is imbued throughout with a scientific attitude to Marxism and the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts ; it upholds Marxism without rigid adherence to individual conclusion , carries forward the fine traditions while also being bold to clear the way to forge ahead , and proposes a whole series of new ideas and concepts , expressing major theoretical innovations .  
An expert working on a certain base of the General Armament Department said that faced with new situations and tasks , scientific researchers must strive to realize the important ideology of the " Three Represents , " to occupy the main battle position of the world 's advanced military scientific and technological development , and to become the advanced representatives for the modernization construction and development of the weapons and equipment of the Chinese Army .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .

The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
He added that apart from the gradual improvement in material conditions , a good academic research environment should include an institutional environment for scientific research , a humanistic environment , a good atmosphere for academic discussion , and harmonious interpersonal relationships .  
- - We must uphold Marxism , most importantly upholding scientific tenets and scientific spirit along with the innovative spirit of Marxism , be adept at becoming aware of and studying forward moving new situations and new questions based on changes in the objective situation , continually drawing nourishment from the fresh experiences of the masses created in practice , and continually advancing and improving our work . 
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
Development of economic construction and scientific and technological undertakings requires the Party and the country to formulate proper policies , the strong support of all levels of Party administration and government , the unrelenting hard work of the numerous science and technology workers , and the common participation of all the people across the country .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
This is the most basic requirement of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , as well as the scientific methodology of Marxism . Marx , Engels , Lenin , and Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were all adept at putting forward new ideology and theories based on actual development changes .  
Young people are in their prime , their thinking is quick , they readily accept new things , and they have an abundance of creative spirit , but the spirit of science must be firmly established , they must work hard to dig into scientific knowledge , and they must have the far-sighted aspiration of contributing their own youth and knowledge to the motherland and the people .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .  They should teach them to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and to consolidate their determination to devote their lives to scientific undertakings and their confidence to attain new accomplishments .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Regarding achievements in science research that are technologically ripe , have broad market prospects , and produce good economic results , the government should coordinate with relevant departments and concentrate efforts on speeding up their transformation and industrialization .  The government should also help science and technology enterprises and scientific research institutions that are changing their system grow in size and strength .  
Through international cooperation the Chinese science and technology community has extensively learned advanced scientific research theory and management methods , enhanced its research and development capabilities , and improved engineering and product quality . and has also gained good economic and social returns ; at the same time , they have also made their own contributions to the development of modern science .  
On the other hand , nine-year compulsory education should be promoted in a comprehensive manner .  Reform of the curriculum should be deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular activity bases and science museums to cultivate the scientific knowledge and innovative awareness of secondary and primary students , and promote quality education .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
Between 15 and 20 June , in the company of Zhang Dejiang , secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee , and Chai Songyue , governor of Zhejiang Province , Li Lanqing mainly inspected basic education , vocational education , higher education , and scientific research in Wenzhou , Ningbo , Shaoxing , and Hangzhou . He also held meetings with representatives of the educational circles to discuss issues on deepening educational reforms , comprehensively advancing quality education , orienting education to serving local economic and social development .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
The circular pointed out : All levels should set sufficient store by the education conducted in small , scattered , or remote units , including the teaching and research section , the scientific research section , the technology section , the medical section or office , the sanitarium for retired cadres , and so on , and should take effective measures to strengthen guidance in this regard .  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
This is a scientific appraisal made in a historical perspective and based on reality and great foresight .  It will largely encourage the business circles and all other social sectors in Hong Kong to make concerted efforts with collective wisdom , jointly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) government headed by Tung Chee-hwa in its administration by law , thus create a brighter future for Hong Kong .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
At the ceremony of promoting military officers to the military and police rank of general on 21 June , Jiang Zemin made a special emphasis in his speech : In the year of the new century [ as published ] , cadres at the divisional-bureau level in all services and arms as well as all military scientific research institutes are required to attain the level of higher education and the level of possessing modern professional knowledge .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
Military training by scientific and technological means is a comprehensive and profound change , which will have a fundamental , complete , and deep influence on military training , military struggle , and army-building .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
To make the work of arming the whole party with Marxist theory more successful , we must vigorously promote the study style of integrating theory with practice , adhere to the Marxist scientific spirit and tenets , persist in emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , and work hard to arrive at scientific , persuasive , and realistic interpretations and explanations on prominent current issues that require theoretical guidance and explanation , so as to make full use of the fundamental role of theory in ideological-political work .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
Taken internationally , science and technology are advancing rapidly with each passing day in the world at present , the process of globalization is gathering pace , the trend toward a multi-polar world pattern is irreversible , and the competition in comprehensive national strength taking the economic , scientific and technological , and military strength and national cohesion as principal contents is increasingly vehement .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
To put it another way , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future , with Marxism as the guide and the training of citizens who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the objective .  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
I am convinced , positive scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation among countries of different social systems , economic modes , cultural traditions , and development levels are beneficial to the relevant parties and the entire world 's development .  
It has been learned that compared with its predecessor , the second manned spacecraft with an unmanned module [ kong cang zai ren tai kong chuan ] is much lighter , even though it still allows space for carrying three astronauts .  In addition , the second spacecraft is much easier to operate in the cabin , and the distribution of the cables is more scientific and practical .  All this has laid down a good foundation for raising the overall standards of China 's future manned spacecraft .  
It became the first book which introduced China to the West . On 6 November 1970 , China and Italy formally established diplomatic ties , thereby opening up a new chapter of friendship and cooperation .  Both countries have made comprehensive progress in facilitating political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological cooperation .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
At present , all the five countries are faced with the arduous tasks of invigorating the economy , of catching up with the tide of scientific and technological development , and of coping with the globalization challenges ; hence the earnest desire to have a long-term stable and peaceful environment for construction .  
Over the past eight-odd years since China and Turkmenistan established diplomatic ties , both countries have gradually expanded mutually-beneficial political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational cooperation , and attained good results in this regard .  
The amendments to the customs law adopted at the meeting are conducive to safeguarding the sovereignty and interests of the country , cracking down on smuggling and criminal activities , strengthening supervision over the customs , expediting the establishment of a modern customs system , promoting economic cooperation as well as trade , scientific , technological , and cultural exchanges with other countries , and ensuring the smooth development of the drive for socialist modernization .  
They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .  Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
( 2 ) Professional software education shall be set up or intensified in adult or spare time education ( university of electrical engineering and so forth ) , and vigorous support shall be given to enterprises , scientific research institutes , and social forces to hold all kinds of software technical training , and to promote knowledge update and re-education among workers at work .  
The restructuring of scientific research institutions is conducive not only to making scientific and technological achievements market-oriented , applying such achievements in industrial production , and promoting the optimization , readjustment , and development of our country 's economic structure but to deepening the reform of government institutions , changing government functions , and making it possible for the government to concentrate on the macro - management of all industries .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Jiang Zemin viewed with great interest the materials , parts , components , and mechanical and electrical products turned out by the machine-building , metallurgical , nonferrous , petrochemical , light , textile and building material industries , the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Ministry of Education , and other departments , listened to briefings by scientific research personnel , and asked in detail about some of the production and technical problems .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
All publicity and ideological bases and spiritual and cultural products must be favorable to publicizing scientific theory , disseminating advanced education , and shaping good minds .  We must not provide the channels of dissemination for wrong things .  
In theoretical work , we must uphold the emancipation of the mind , do practical work , and closely link our work to actual conditions .  We must apply the Marxist stance , viewpoint , and method to make scientific , convincing , and practical explanations of major ideological and theoretical issues that the cadres and masses are concerned about , so as to unify thoughts and forces .

all expenses in a year are crystal clear ; and all internal financial departments do not need to : make a budget , apply for additional appropriations , care about their financial accounts , and set aside funds to meet unexpected needs .  Therefore , the budget is scientific and transparent , and the fund distribution is fair and just .  
If our basic research is not developed and can not reach the advanced international level , we will lack the strength for sustained scientific and technological progress and economic development , and our goal will be hard to achieve .

A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
Through vigorously popularizing scientific , healthy , and civilized modes of fitness among the broad masses , we should enable the physical culture work to play its unique role in uniting the broad masses , maintaining social stability , and promoting the building of both material and spiritual civilizations .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
- - Comprehensively promoting the strategy of " boosting Shandong with science and education , " sticking to the principle of quality education , leading scientific and technical innovation , and industrialization of hi-tech .  Shandong should work hard to attain a new leap in science , technology , and education , and realize the shift of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers to boost economic construction .  
Mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out and expanded gradually in the economic and trade , scientific and technological , cultural and education , and public health fields , and has achieved positive results .  
The dissemination of scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific spirit will be a long-term and arduous task .  This state of affairs is out of step with the great cause of national revitalization that the Chinese nation is undertaking , so we must make concerted efforts to create a positive environment that is conducive to the healthy development of the awareness of innovation .  We should seize the great opportunity of implementing the 10th Five-Year Plan ;  
The State Council in 1999 promulgated the " National Scientific and Technological Rewarding Provisions , " reformed the scientific and technological rewarding system , and set up the nation 's highest scientific and technological awards for the excellent and top-notch scientific and technological talents who made outstanding contributions .  
This essential move has enhanced the authority and influence of the national scientific and technological rewards and further embodied the party and the nation 's policies on respecting knowledge and professionals .  This move has also manifested the strong determination and firm confidence of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in implementing the strategy of invigorating the county through science and education and in vigorously promoting the innovations of science and technology .  Hence , this move has already produced and will continue to produce a great and far-reaching influence .  
The party and state 's ample rewards to scientific and technological personnel and the hard working and enterprising spirit of the awarded scientists will certainly and utterly inspire the national pride and self-confidence of numerous scientific and technological workers as well as the people throughout the country .  This will also encourage the vast numbers of scientific and technological workers to blaze new trials , initiate undertakings , scale the scientific heights of the world , overcome new challenges , and win a new victory .  
Practice has proved that the series of major decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core are correct ; all localities and departments have been effective in implementing the line , principles , and policies of the central authorities ; and the vast numbers of scientific and technological personnel , educational workers , as well as people from all social circles on the united front have made remarkable contribution to the country 's economic development .  
The responsible persons of relevant departments under central and state organs ; the responsible persons of the national committees of all democratic parties , as well as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce ; non-party personages ; and all the representatives attending the national Science and Technology Award-giving rally as well as the representatives of the capital 's scientific and technological circles , totaling more than 3,000 people , attended the report meeting .  
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
In order to help the infatuates gradually stop being dependent on " Falungong " and master scientific ways of staying healthy , we arranged for medical staff and sports teachers to explain to them that healthy sports and recreational activities are the only things that would benefit physical and mental health .  We organized them to practice Taijiquan and fitness exercises ; conducted the activity of singing aloud revolutionary songs , such as " No Communist Party , No New China ; "  
The troops were explicitly required to tightly grasp the fundamental link of keeping firm ideal and belief and adopting the scientific world outlook of Marxism in the struggle of exposing and denouncing " Falungong . " Officers and servicemen were told to distinguish the right from the wrong on principle issues , lay a firm ideological foundation , increase their political immunity .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
The four other guiding principles are taking the structural readjustment as the main thread , making reform and opening up and scientific and technical progress as the motive power , improving the living standards of the general public as the starting point , and persisting in a coordinated economic and social development .  
We are also facing the arduous tasks of reforming the education and scientific research systems , the administrative system , the financial system , the investment system , the taxation system , the foreign trade system , the social security system , the income distribution system , the medical and public health system , and especially the leadership system , the economic system , and the management systems in all aspects .  In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
It is important to bring into play the roles of the elderly ; and according to the principle of integrating voluntary participation with one 's actual ability and integrating the demands of the society with one 's personal interests , the elderly should be encouraged to participate in activities of educating the younger generation , passing on scientific and cultural knowledge , providing consulting services , and taking part in social welfare undertakings and in the spiritual civilization building of their communities .  
They should lay special emphasis on the study of the international strategic situation , high-tech local warfare , and the law of military management characteristic of the new situation so as to keep enhancing the scientific nature and effectiveness of their work of PLA construction and preparedness for military struggles .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on . 
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
He said , an important guiding idea on drawing up and instituting the 10th FYP is to take system innovation and science and technology innovation as the motive force in driving economic and social development , and this is also a scientific conclusion derived from the historical experiences of reform , opening up , and modernization in China .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
CPPCC National Committee Member Huang Guancong held that since China has a large territory with its different parts keeping their own special characteristics , it is necessary to scientifically study and reasonably plan out the program of construction of small cities and towns , based on scientific feasibility studies and in light of each locality 's regional and local strong points and weaknesses , resource availability , and population condition .  
Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .  We can not stick to the conventional way of doing things , but nor can we rush ahead blindly , kill the goose that lays the golden eggs , or duplicate low-level projects , not to mention merely paying lip service or practicing formalism . "  
We should persist in taking accelerated development as the main theme , bring into full play our advantages , such as good location , scientific and educational strengths , and rich natural resources , and , on the basis of the sound development scored in the Ninth Five-Year Plan , strive to increase our overall strength , narrow our gap with east China , quickly raise the people 's income , and ease the employment pressure .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .  
We will further popularize advanced and applicable technologies , step up the development of human , scientific , and technological resources , and solve outstanding problems in economic and social development through scientific and technological innovation .  
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries .

To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
" Because science is advancing daily , it is most important for children in our modern society to acquire an understanding of scientific matters . This is why we incorporate so many detailed and colorful illustrations in our articles , to attract children to the topic and to stimulate their interest , " he notes .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
The goal of national park management is to conserve treasured natural scenic areas in Taiwan which are judged to be of national or international significance . Besides pursuing conservation goals , park administration is aimed at providing sites for scientific studies , educational training , and recreational activities .  
Why is there no science in Chinese culture ? " - - this kind of question seems unavoidably anachronistic today , largely thanks to Joseph Needham and his collaborators who have spent more than half a century looking at all the evidence concerned . Now , no matter whether in East or West , most people can understand the scientific achievements of ancient and medieval China and how far China was ahead of the West .  
It was in this environment that Needham used his prestige as a famous Western scientist . He not only stressed to those around him that " bombs were originally invented in China " but even suggested that if the Chinese had not invented gunpowder and cannon then the feudal warlords of medieval Europe would never have lost their castles , feudalism would not have been dissolved and the following social changes - - the rise of the bourgeoisie and the scientific revolution - - might not have happened .  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
The period of tsarist conservatism at the end of the nineteenth century emphasized study of the classics and intellectuals were not allowed to delve into the natural sciences . Because Moscow was far removed from the center of power - - then in St Petersburg - - it became the hotbed of developments in the natural sciences and established a solid scientific structure .  
On the other hand , Lenin , who had finished off the age of tsarist feudalism , stressed the need to industrialize and modernize the nation . This meant paying special attention to the study of science and engineering . With the confrontation between East and West following World War Two , the communists put more energy into scientific research that was linked to the defense industries . Even a lot of persecuted researchers were made to continue their work in the laboratories established in prison .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
The roots of a big tree : To place its scientific development on a firm footing in the world , Taiwan has to putting down roots in applied science first as a strategic choice . But Li Tai-feng warns that " a country that has become industrially and commercially developed only recently is liable to overemphasize practical applications and neglect basic research . "  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
Originally , no lead-containing ingredients were used in the preparation of pa-pao-san . Large amounts of cinnabar were , however , and because cinnabar was expensive and in short supply , some Chinese pharmacists substituted other mineral in-gredients , such as huang-tan ( yellow lead ) or chientan ( red lead or minimum - - the scientific name is lead tetraoxide ) , which are similar to cinnabar in color . The result of this misuse was numerous cases of lead poisoning in newborn infants .  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning . I hope that agencies in charge of public health will extend regulation to Chinese medicine .  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Early on , heavenly bodies were named after mythical figures , nations or cities or otherwise already deceased " scientific legends " Wu Chien-hsiung 's outstanding accomplishments in physics earned her the admiration of researchers at Nanjing 's Mt . Zijin Observatory , who named the star they discovered after her .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
Apparently the work of weather forecaster was divided into 12 hr . shifts on a rotational basis . And every five persons constituted a section , administered and governed by a head forecaster . After Jen Li-yu was promoted to serve as head forecaster , an unexpected turn of events turned him overnight into a star media performer . At the time , the Chinese Television System had decided to arrange a more factual and scientific weather forecast after the evening news broadcast .  
From a modern perspective , the ancient Chinese used the Solar Terms to integrate astronomical and meteorological observations . They have a scientific derivation - - the earth rotates at a tilted angle as it orbits around the sun . According to the different position of each location on the globe , the sun 's rays will land at correspondingly different angles , and in this way the alternating seasonal cycle of winter , spring , summer and autumn is produced .  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed . Someone who is hypnotized enters a trance-like state controlled by the right hemisphere .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
She says frankly that the thing a judge fears most is breaking a big case " in an ugly way , " when the physical evidence at the scene has been destroyed in rescuing the survivors , making it impossible to take samples which could be submitted for scientific analysis ( for example , DNA matching for bloodstains ) . In such cases , there are only the court witnesses and the eyewitnesses ' indirect evidence , which are much less persuasive .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
The books say , for example : " When the qi reaches the fingertips , the fingertips grow warm and begin to tingle , as if there were ants crawling over them . " These idiosyncratic descriptions are enlightening , but might it not be possible to measure these phenomena with scientific instruments ? It is also reported that when one reaches a certain level of proficiency in martial arts , one sometimes experiences uncontrollable twitching and jerky movements , due to spontaneous movement of the qi .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
His mathematical and astronomical researches included mystical topics rejected by modern science . To Fu Ta-wei , a professor of history at National Tsing Hua University , " Shen Gua was not by any means a strict advocate of the scientific method .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science . Teachers have carefully created a systematic curriculum , designed diversified teaching activities , and produced supplementary educational materials and lectures not part of the standard textbooks . When necessary , they undertake deeper and broader learning activities . The goal is to develop students with the ability to think creatively and with a spirit of scientific research .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
China 's rulers have supported astronomy since ancient times , and departments concerned with matters of astronomy are among the very earliest scientific research organs in the history of Chinese bureaucracy . An imperial observatory was established in 2000 BC , and its Qin dynasty successor in the 3rd century BC employed over 300 people . Astronomy has always been highly valued , and dynastic changes never resulted in a cutoff of support .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
A : The process was quite convoluted . In 1979 , we submitted an article to an American academic journal . The editor thought the findings violated scientific principles , as anyone with minimal knowledge of chemistry knew that molecules could not possibly exist in such combinations , and therefore rejected the paper . Perhaps to preserve academic objectivity , they sought the additional appraisal of an authority in the field , who also judged my assumptions to be too bold , casting doubt on the conclusions .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
head of the chinese delegation told xinhua that " the exhibition is a window aiming at promoting the mutual understanding between china and indonesia , increasing the exchange between scientific and technological as well as industrial circles of our two countries , and seeking channels of cooperation to achieve common development "  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity

finally , kohl stressed that enhanced relations with asia will " serve germany 's basic political and economic interests " he called on the economic , scientific and technological circles to take an active part in the asia plan  
He noted that the maintaining of a long term and in depth exchange of contacts between the two countries is conducive to the promotion of bilateral educational , scientific and technological development , and beneficial to the advancement of bilateral friendly relations oriented towards the 21st century  
Shen said that protecting IPR and rigorously cracking down on IPR infringements are the requirement of China 's own reform and opening up , its economic growth and scientific and technological advancement The tremendous efforts and remarkable achievement China has made in this regard are universally acknowledged  
iran and slovenia also agreed to establish air links between tehran and ljubljana , the slovenian capital , as well as + cultural , scientific , commercial and economic ties , + the radio said  
Peng , vice chairperson of the Chinese National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , said China and Norway have witnessed growing cooperation in economic , cultural , scientific and technological and environmental protection affairs since the forging of their diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago  
due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
As for science and education in construction , China has achieved 124 scientific and technological research results , which are up to advanced international level And a total of nearly 480,000 personnel have received education in the construction departments of various colleges and schools nationwide  
In his written statement upon arrival at Jakarta Airport , Wang Hanbin expressed his satisfaction over the development of bilateral relations , especially the exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the economic , scientific , technological and cultural fields since the resumption of diplomatic ties seven years ago  
In this connection , special reference may be made to the Cooperation Agreement concluded on 9 October 1990 , which provided for mutual cooperation in all fields : political , economic and social , scientific and cultural .  
As the century draws to a close , the world is experiencing profound changes in the ideological , political , economic , social , scientific and technical spheres .  
We have shouldered our responsibilities in this regard and have played an active role in international discussions to find a workable and balanced solution to global warming based on proven scientific evidence .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
The Conference acknowledged the need to organize regional workshops regularly and provide expert advisory services with a strong involvement in the United Nations system , in collaboration with international scientific and professional organizations . 
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction management and supervisory tasks .  
Early warning and alert information gathered by scientific institutions and regional civil defence organizations on disasters are a prerequisite to rapid response .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
It is estimated that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
" Calls upon all States to encourage the broad-based participation of local authorities and all relevant actors , including the scientific community , industry , trade unions , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the national , regional and international preparatory process and to encourage a wide exchange of information and experience in this respect , in particular on the programmes of work and activities of national committees . "  
The greatest national benefit will be obtained if the exercise is based on the overall principles adopted by in-country preparatory processes , i.e . , the participation of civic leaders , the academic and scientific community , grass-roots community leaders and non-governmental and community-based organizations , the private sector and human settlements professionals .  
The influx of young people into the labour market has led to the emergence of acute social problems ; rapid advances in many scientific and technical areas have posed new challenges that must be faced by the education and training systems if youth unemployment is to be addressed properly and prevented from giving rise to many social ills , such as marginalization , poverty and delinquency .  
Firstly , in the cultural and intellectual area , as it constitutes the vision which guides youth in all areas ; secondly , in the aesthetic field , art and literature are the essential pillars of culture ; thirdly , science as the basis of progress in our present generation which is witnessing growing scientific progress ; fourthly , sports and military fields ; fifthly , public social service , and finally , the field of trips and touristic activities and hostels .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
Indeed , it is critical to the preservation of the heritage of all art-rich nations that their cultural properties be preserved in their geographical and natural surroundings and be available for scientific and archaeological studies in their proper context .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
In this context , our delegation notes with satisfaction the significant activity of major donor countries and of the international financial organizations , primarily the World Bank , to provide scientific , expert and technological assistance to the Palestinian people to tackle tasks related to the need to improve their social and economic conditions rapidly , strengthen institutions of self-government , establish a financial and banking system , and train highly qualified national personnel .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies . 
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on environmental and developmental ethics , in order to develop a common value framework between the scientific and technological community and society as a whole , and promote continuous dialogue ;  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) continued to carry out research in partnership with national , regional and international genetic resources programmes as a means of strengthening the scientific basis for its work encompassing in situ and ex situ conservation and the sustainable use of plant , livestock and aquatic genetic resources .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such technical advisory panel ( s ) as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
Calls upon all States to encourage the broad-based participation of local authorities and all relevant actors , including the scientific community , industry , trade unions , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the national , regional and international preparatory process and to encourage a wide exchange of information and experience in this respect , in particular on the programmes of work and activities of national committees ;  
By including this programme area in chapter 35 of Agenda 21 , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) recognized that development and natural resources management will be sustainable only if it is based on sound science , using the best scientific knowledge available and with continued research to improve the knowledge base .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
National plans and investment in science should further global environment and developmental observing systems and should strengthen internationally coordinated scientific programmes on environment and development involving relevant United Nations bodies and major international scientific bodies .  
However , there are several emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that are not yet adequately addressed by specific scientific programmes at the international level .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
Major constraints being experienced by the countries include , in particular , a drastic decline in financial resources to adequately maintain the various valuable scientific and technological infrastructures and , of increasing concern , the critical reduction in the scientific workforce in bioscience and biotechnology .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
Recommendation 1 , Catalytic role of UNEP in emerging environmental issues : UNDP should , in its catalytic role in emerging environmental issues , draw to a greater extent on the contributions of the United Nations system and of the international scientific and other professional communities , to ensure that problems of wide international significance receive appropriate and adequate consideration by Governments , through the Governing Council and other bodies .  
Recommendation 7 , Access to scientific data : UNEP should promote through Earthwatch a global policy of enhanced availability , within the framework of United Nations mandated programmes , of existing environmental data at the national or international levels so as to facilitate the delivery of environmental management tools intended for country decision makers .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based upon sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Incorporate the educational concepts of the Maya and other indigenous peoples , particularly in the philosophical , scientific , artistic , pedagogical , historical , linguistic and socio-political areas , as part of the overall reform of the educational system ;  
Regulate and support a system of informational , scientific , artistic and educational programmes on indigenous cultures in their languages , through the national radio , television and the written media .  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
It urges Governments and major groups , as well as relevant international organizations and the scientific community , to participate actively in strengthening Earthwatch as an international partnership to ensure an adequate flow of information on the global and regional environment , to support decision-making and to give early warning on the state of the environment .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The main objectives of the association are to further economic integration , develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea and strengthen functional cooperation in the political , cultural , scientific , social and technological areas .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
This research needs to be guided at all stages by users and from the perspective of gender , particularly the perspective of women , and should be carried out in strict conformity with internationally accepted legal , ethical , medical and scientific standards for biomedical research ;  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
There is danger that , due to scientific / technological backwardness , the Federal Republic may experience a period of " ecologic blockade " after the sanctions are lifted , because its economy will not be ready to meet the demands of the markets of developed countries who are the Republic 's main trade partners .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .

Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
those organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations , scientific associations and non-governmental organizations which , in accordance with decisions of their governing bodies , have incorporated the recommendations of the General Assembly relating to disaster reduction and those of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction in their programmes of work , thus contributing towards effective progress in disaster reduction in their mandated responsibilities and respective fields of activity , including the allocation of budgetary resources for disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
This reorganization of the international system on the basis of strategic economic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific and technological revolution , a revolution of knowledge that spread across the planet and brought about the most profound change ever experienced in the history of humankind , turning the world into one large neighbourhood .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
It is therefore gratifying to note from his latest report , contained in A / 51 / 390 , that Antarctica continues to play a critical role as a centre for scientific programmes and for peaceful cooperation among States and in improving our understanding of its environment and its dependent and associated ecosystem .  
As we all know , Antarctica is a unique ecosystem endowed with rich mineral resources , ideal conditions for scientific research , 90 per cent of the world 's fresh water resources and rare species of flora and fauna . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
The joint flight programme of the five Russian cosmonauts and the American astronaut included biomedical research under the Mir-Shuttle programme , experiments to determine the properties of structural materials exposed to open-space conditions and also the assembly at the Mir station of a number of scientific instruments intended for various experiments and studies under the continuing joint flight programme .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .  
Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
The second objective of the subprogramme is to assist governments to establish , maintain and strengthen national controls over the licit supply of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The third objective of the subprogramme is to manage the international system of control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors used for licit purposes in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
Working under the guidance of INCB , UNDCP and governments will ensure that narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors needed for medical , scientific and other licit purposes will continue to be available ; diversion of narcotic drugs from international trade into the illicit traffic will continue to be minimal ; and the level of diversion of psychotropic substances from international trade will decrease .  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Commending those organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations , scientific associations and non-governmental organizations which , in accordance with decisions of their governing bodies , have incorporated the recommendations of the General Assembly relating to disaster reduction and those of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction in their programmes of work , thus contributing towards effective progress in disaster reduction in their mandated responsibilities and respective fields of activity , including the allocation of budgetary resources for disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
It was stated that pure scientific , applied and experimental research relevant to natural hazard management was required .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
Parties to the Protocol on Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) , not yet in force , are also expected , as a second step , to negotiate further measures to reduce VOC emissions or their transboundary fluxes and their resulting secondary photochemical oxidant products , taking into account , inter alia , the best available scientific and technological developments , scientifically determined critical levels and internationally accepted target levels , as well as the role of nitrogen oxides in the formation of photochemical oxidants .  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based on sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Basic scientific research " : experimental or theoretical work undertaken principally to acquire new knowledge of the fundamental principles of phenomena or observable facts , not primarily directed towards a specific practical aim or objective .  
To establish , maintain and strengthen national and international controls over licit supplies of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors in a manner that ensures adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes while preventing diversion to illicit channels .  
Finally , a sixth objective is to respond to the expressed need of the international community for the annual consideration , review and evaluation of continuing developments related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs in the General Assembly through the monitoring and analysis of and reporting on developments relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs , including legal , political , economic , technological and scientific developments .  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
The fact that descendants of African slaves and immigrants from Europe and Asia felt more integrated in the Brazilian ' melting pot ' than in other multiracial societies might explain why physical appearance and the colour of skin - as surprising as it may appear to the Rapporteur - tend to prevail over any kind of race classification based upon legal definitions and scientific theories .  
Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
Furthermore , international law permits the coastal State to conduct only marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone , not " any kind of research " , as stated in article 14 , subparagraph ( b ) ( ii ) , of the aforementioned Iranian Act .  
implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
The 124 national reports received by the Habitat II secretariat confirm that national planning processes generally adhered to this pattern , including representatives of national ministries , public and parastatal organizations , local authorities , the scientific and academic community , professional organizations , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the private sector .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
During the last 40 years , the Congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
It explains why the Tunisia of the new era has opted for a national scientific development policy targeted on the needs of Tunisian society and guaranteeing increased protection of human rights conceived as an essential condition of economic , social and cultural progress .  
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The role of the universities , equipped with scientific councils representing the teaching and research institutions and research personnel and elected under a democratic system independent of the Administration , has shown considerable improvement over the earlier situation ( regulated by Act No . 86-80 of 9 August 1986 ) .  
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
When engaged in a scientific activity abroad a researcher is subject to the " official mission " schedule , which accords him a privileged status and allowances which are dependent on his grade but , in any event , sufficient to cover the costs of his stay abroad and , if necessary , of registration fees and travel .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
In addition to the relaxation of the regulations governing the establishment of associations , which has worked greatly to the benefit of learned societies - present in vast numbers in the early 1990s - the State has also encouraged learned societies both by contributing to their annual budgets and by supporting the scientific events which they organize .  
This strategy outlines Panama 's policy on maritime matters , with regard to its legal , scientific , economic and environmental aspects , and indicates the principles and purposes that guide the Panamanian State in its efforts to integrate itself in regional and international maritime activities in accordance with domestic legislation and international law .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries which produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
In conclusion , he urged all Parties to encourage the establishment or strengthening of national climate committees , as well as national and regional action plans for climate change , in support of the Climate Agenda , an inter-agency initiative to establish an integrated framework for international climate-related scientific and technical programmes , and reaffirmed WMO 's strong commitment to fully support the Convention and its implementation process . implemented jointly . 
The IPCC welcomed critical comments based on careful scientific and technical analyses , but many of the objections raised had already been considered in the IPCC process and rejected because of inadequate scientific bases .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fishery-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized , and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fishery organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;

The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
In recent years , China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense has attained achievements of world interest , and a great headway has been registered in the development and production quality of key weapons models .  Particularly , the successful launching of satellites , the successful completion of the National Day parade , and the successful launching of the " Shenzhou " experimental spacecraft have greatly inspired the spirit of the nation , and have enhanced the prestige of our country and our army .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
Its main function is to undertake the treatment and disposal of nuclear energy , nuclear material , nuclear fuel , exhausted fuel , and radioactive waste , the prospecting and excavation of uranium deposits , the scientific research and development as well as the construction , production , and operation of nuclear energy and nuclear-related fields , such as nuclear instrument and equipment , isotope , nuclear technology application , and economic cooperation with foreign countries and import-export businesses .  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Over the past several years , the CPC Central Committee centered on Comrade Jiang Zemin has been able to grasp the overall situation , engaged in scientific decision-making , and led the entire party and people of all nationalities nationwide in making efforts , resulting in the overcoming of political , economic , and natural difficulties and risks .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
In his speech celebrating the centennial of Beijing University , he called on the vast number of young people to integrate the acquisition of scientific and cultural knowledge with the strengthening of ideological cultivation , book learning with social practice , the attainment of values with serving the motherland and the people , and the cultivation of lofty ideals with the conduct of hard struggles .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
The author acts in line with his personal experiences in living and working in the United States for many years , an on-site investigation , and longstanding hard scientific research , using rich data and vivid examples , to outline the basic framework of US strategy and tactics toward China since 1946 .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
Xu Zhigong has long been engaged in the work of political theoretical education and research .  Over the years , he has regarded the implementation of Chairman Jiang 's instruction of " arming the people with scientific theories " as his lofty mission , worked with ardent loyalty , studied assiduously , made innovations in a pioneering spirit , and has achieved remarkable results in the teaching and research of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
Xu Zhigong expressed his determination to live up to the earnest expectations of the leaders of the Central Military Commission , remain modest and prudent , continue to propagate scientific truth with compelling arguments and confidence , draw a clear demarcation line between the right and the wrong , and do a better job in the work of arming the people with Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .  
According to a relevant leading official from the Ministry of Public Security , public security organs can fully and promptly prevent and discover security risks and loopholes in the construction and use of computer information systems through standardized , scientific , and fair assessments and supervision .  This will help to raise public security organs ' level of supervision and management of security protection for computer information systems .  
To properly act as the representative of the direction of the advanced culture in China , the key is to adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further advance the socialist cultural and ethic progress , and work hard to build and create the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future .  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
Before each landing operation , concentrated and unified command organs with specific command responsibilities and various other relevant organizations are established according to the makeup of the participating force and the actual operational requirements , harmonious command relationships are specified , and scientific and rational operational plans are drawn up .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
They should not only use scientific theories to arm themselves and to guide their practical work , but should also show a thirst for knowledge ; make hard efforts to master the knowledge of modern finance , science and technology , and the law ; familiarize themselves with the operational rules of the international market , and learn from the management of multinational companies ;  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Cult leaders accumulated wealth unlawfully and in a big way , and organised their followers to besiege media units , schools , scientific research institutes critical of the sect , seriously disturbing the public order , infringing upon human rights , and endangering other people 's personal safety .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
Leaders at all levels should study hard more new and high-tech knowledge to improve their scientific and technical qualifications , should conduct deep and satisfactory investigation and studies and modestly listen to opinions from experts and personnel involved in science and technology .  Leaders at all levels should always be in a clear-minded state , always direct the army in the right direction of the troop training and carry out the training project in a deep and consistent manner .  
As of date , the unit has established medical , transportation , ordnance , maintenance , telecommunications , and other groups to engage in supporting campaigns and studying methods of operations .  It has exerted great efforts to tackle the most difficult scientific and technical problems and decided on more than 10 topics of study .  The 30-plus theses it published have attracted the attention of academic departments and higher-level administrative departments .  
Empirical evidence shows that the peoples of ancient nations , as long as they positively bring into play the profound advantages accumulated from their culture and diligent , brave traditions , can also absorb modern scientific culture 's inventions and creations , keenly innovate , and unceasingly strengthen themselves , and thereby definitely have the capability , while on the road to developing themselves , of writing a new chapter that accords with the demands of the age .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : The cooperation between our two countries has also proved satisfactory in the educational , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
It has set up a number of specialized laboratories for nuclear and chemical protection research and experiments .  It has a high-level contingent of scientists and researchers .  Over the years , it has attained a number of scientific research achievements that are up to advanced world standards in the field of nuclear and chemical protection .  
Not long ago , a Chinese-language newspaper based in the United States published a signed long article by " some practitioners of Falungong in the Chinese Academy of Sciences , " entitled " It Is No Superstition , but a Broad and Profound Science " and subtitled " Our Own Experience of Practicing Falun Dharma as Science and Technology Workers . " It came with a dozen or so " bibliographic references , " making it look like a " scientific paper . "  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
The authorized sizes of our military academies are rather irrational .  It is necessary to make great efforts to enhance students ' scientific and cultural foundation as well as their ability in commanding and management .  We should run well the National Defense University , which aims at cultivating senior commanders who participate in the joint training program for officers of the three forces .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
The regiment commander took his staff officers in charge of training to the company where they set up a group to tackle training bottlenecks with regard to the new equipment .  The group was formed by three platoon leaders , who had just been assigned to the company by a military academy , as well as some of the company 's backbone training personnel known for better education .  After working hard for two months , the group compiled a user-friendly training program and some teaching materials complete with detailed contents and scientific standards .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .  
In today 's world , where economic globalization is making rapid development , scientific and technological progress is changing everyday , and countries are intensifying their competition to raise comprehensive national strength , it is particularly important to stir up and encourage the national innovative spirit .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
We must strengthen our efforts to cut off the supply of illegal drugs in Yunnan , Guangxi , and other border areas in China 's southwest , northwest , and northeast regions as well as in the southeast coastal region by increasing the use of scientific and technological equipment , intensifying investigation and arrests , firmly stopping the influx of illegal drugs , and strictly preventing the flow of precursor chemicals out of the restricted areas .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
At 10:20 , the command center received from higher levels " an order of recruiting specialized technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment to support the front " .  It immediately started the plan for recruiting technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment from the national defense mobilization database and transmitted the plan to the various command sub-centers for scientific and technological mobilization .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
On site , the writer saw a series of situations being sent to the directorial center in real time and promptly .  They included whether the commanders could rapidly and accurately make judgments on enemy situations , whether they could make scientific decisions , whether instructions could be sent to affiliated combat troops amid electronic interference , whether troops could trust deep into the enemy force and take up position as scheduled and according to instructions , and whether information on the enemy could be handled effectively .  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
The units involved have summed up and popularized the achievements that the army has made in scientific and technological troops training in recent years .  Through repeated attempts for improvement , innovation , and development , they have eventually solved knotty problems that have puzzled the army for a long time regarding operations under future hi-tech conditions .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
The Bayi Men 's Basketball Team has defeated its competitors in consecutive games and has won games one after the other because the team - consistently aiming for first-class quality in their play is consistent and strict in managing the team , applies scientific theories to training , constantly perfecting the skills of every player , does not consider losses for and gains to individuals and relies on teamwork for victories .  Unity leads to combat strength and industrious training leads to excellent soldiers .  
In today 's world , the scientific and technological revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds , a knowledge economy is rising rapidly , economic globalization is currently undergoing an increasingly accelerated process , and competition in comprehensive national strength is becoming more and more acute .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
" fundamental " means that once the scientific method is established , it will become the soul of the individual , the nation and the people .  It will stimulate the people to love life , to pursue truth , and to be intelligent and sharp , to be fair and unselfish , to be self-confident , not cocky , to be rigorous , not picky , to be upright and outspoken , calm and unhurried , to be filled with the spirit of creativity and creative vitality .  
Raising the scientific and cultural level of all the people is a huge systematic undertaking , one which requires painstaking planning and organization , and one which can not be left unemphasized , nor worse yet bogged down with the usual sighs of emotion .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
clearly defined the relevant study tasks and targets ; organized officers and men to study electronics science , microelectronics science , photoelectron science and other modern scientific and technological know-how ; and laid a solid knowledge foundation for mastering new equipment , and conducting exercises on new subjects .  
closely center our efforts around the need to enhance our ability of " winning the war " ; conscientiously summarize the practical experiences of the troops ; and strive to create flexible and diversified methods of operation , intensive and highly efficient methods of training , and scientific and standardized methods of management .  
Due to the prompt action taken in education and effective measures implemented , everyone maintained a healthy psychological attitude on the scientific knowledge in highland .  While not fearing the highland , they adopted a serious attitude to counter the problems on highland .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
We must ensure first that they are qualified in the political sense , and second in a scientific and cultural sense , in professional skills and capacities and also in physical and psychological health .  We must further ensure that these experts have acquired comprehensive knowledge in various fields , overall coordination abilities , an innovative spirit as well as innovative capacities .  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
The new leading body of the Beijing Military Representatives Bureau conducted in-depth investigation and held a " forum on weaponry development " in late August with the participation of leaders and relevant experts from the offices of science , technology and industry for national defense , in five provinces and cities in northern China , all military enterprises , and military representatives offices stationed in various enterprises and jointly discussed plans with them on scientific research and development of military products .  
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
The fact that Cheng Kejie committed serious crimes once again showed that it is of critical importance to establish and perfect a whole set of scientific and rational mechanisms with binding force for management and supervising leading cadres in preventing and checking corruption .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
These heroic units have demonstrated their new graceful bearing in operating new equipment and applying new technology in scientific and technological military training .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
The PLA 's success in carrying out the activities of exchanging successful experience of scientific and technological military training will yield an important effect on furthering the scientific and technological military training .  The participants in the activities included the leaders in charge of training and education of major participating units ; the leaders of the air force , naval fleets and second artillery bases under various military regions ;  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
Zhang Shiming , who has been engaged in long-term research on innovative utilization of straw , believes that it is still necessary at present to accelerate the implementation of strengthening the country through science and education , the development of science , and increasing the scientific level of the entire nation .  In this way , it will enable the broad masses of the people to enhance their abilities to ward off the disturbance and destruction caused by the evil cult organization of " Falungong " .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
When one lacks a skeptical critical spirit and reveres all existing understanding as the absolute , the road to scientific progress , passing , breaking new ground , and innovation would be blocked .  
New scientific theories are the results of summarizing newly verified scientific facts , but we can not ignore the original verified scientific facts ( unless we can scientifically verify that the original beliefs were neither complete nor accurate ) .  We can not repudiate all the scientific content in the original theories that have been scientifically tested .  The evolution of old theories into new theories is not a matter of total repudiation .  
To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Therefore , the two sides will continue maintaining the momentum of high-level intercourse and contacts , deepening the mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological realms , strengthening the omni-directional exchange and cooperation in all realms , and improve the communication and coordination in international and regional affairs .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
Today , the tidal waves of a new scientific and technological revolution marked by the universal application of information technologies are sweeping across the globe with great momentum , and the trend of accelerated reorganization of the world economic structure is increasingly prominent .  
In addition to continuously taking readers ' requirements into first consideration and regarding scientific ways of health preservation and health care as main contents , this section will add some relevant new columns , such as self-treatment of diseases , miraculous ways for long life , origins of human relations , Doctor Feng 's mailbox , weekly medicated food , the quickest way for improving one 's looks , psychology hotlines , and new medical findings .  
At the same time , in innovating training methods and means , it is necessary to adhere to a scientific truth-seeking attitude , prevent and overcome the unrealistic practice of going in for grandiose projects and things foreign , the practice of seeking novelty and surprise without paying attention to practical results , and the practice of being overanxious for quick results , a practice that runs counter to laws .  
Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
promoting the economic , educational , scientific , and cultural cooperation and interchange between Macao and the inland , connecting people from all circles of Macao , improving the association between Macao and the inland , reflecting the opinions that Macao residents have to the inland , managing the related Taiwan affairs , undertaking other matters that the central government hands over . 
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Although many things in Western economic theories reflect the common regularity in mass production and market operation in an era of scientific and technological revolution , being the reflection of the basic economic relations in capitalist society , in essence , such theories just embody the requirements of the capitalist economic system in its contemporary development .  
Therefore , a large portion of the US ' scientific research capability is focused in private departments , university / technical schools , and scientific research centers relying on Department of Defense funds .  They have strong executive mechanisms which organize and maintain a tight relationship between the " procurer " and research center .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
These leaders and institutions should make full use of every modern news media to propagate the grand prospects of our military modernization project in an effort to attract more outstanding scientific and technological specialists who must be patriotic and determined to strengthen the motherland so that these talented individuals can achieve merit in their military careers .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
As a vice president and the chief designer of China 's Research Institute of Air-to-Air Missiles , he took charge of and gave direct leadership to scientific and technological personnel designing and finalizing many types of air-to-air missiles , thus making the our country 's research and development of air-to-air missiles climb onto one new stage after another from starting from scratch to copying and self-designing and until reaching the international advanced level .  
On the basis of analyzing these broken fragments , Dong Bingyin led the scientific and technological personnel in dissecting the generator laden with explosives at the risk of their life for a year .  Through conducting nearly 100 major and minor tests and obtaining up to 1,000 data entries , he finally proved that it was the interference of the missile holder which caused the incident , thus paving the way for resuming the range test .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
According to what has been disclosed by a relevant department today , ever since the state started its " 863 Program " 15 years ago , nearly 10,000 scientific and technological personnel from the army have successively plunged themselves into the research work .  Displaying their outstanding ability and talents to the fullest in high technological fields , they have attained a series of major scientific and technological achievements .  
Groups of scientific and technological personnel , consisting mainly of the academicians of the two academies of sciences , experts , and professors , have successively completed some 1,500 research topics ; made breakthroughs on more than 100 major and key technologies ; won 397 Awards for Scientific and Technological Progress at both the national level and the ministerial-commission level , as well as 137 state patents for invention ;  
During the process of completing the " 863 " research topics , the scientific and technological personnel throughout the army as well as scientific research administrations at all levels have also carried out bold practices in the field of high-tech management .  Today , they have opened up a new path for high-tech research and development which requires less input but can yield a higher economic efficiency , and have laid a solid foundation for a sustainable development in the future .  
It was with the spirit of facing the gap , being unwilling to lag behind , striving to catch up with developed countries , being independent and innovative and consistently assailing scientific heights which is upheld by the majority of scientific and technological workers that enabled us to gain our precious foothold in the extraordinarily fierce high-tech competition .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
In October 1990 , the DPRK government recruited many outstanding scientific research personnel from all scientific research academies and institutes nationwide , put in huge funds , and organized and established formally the " DPRK Computer Center " in Pyongyang , which was equipped with various types of advanced facilities , and is fully responsible for the development and application of computer technology and the work of popularizing computer knowledge nationwide .  
At the same time , with rapid scientific and technological development , the growing dominance of the knowledge economy and network economy in social and economic development , and continual acceleration of economic globalization , the contests of scientific and technological , economic , and comprehensive national capabilities are becoming increasingly fierce .  
They should train and bring up a contingent of high-quality leaders of different types at various levels who are firm in their political stand , manifest new pioneering spirit and possess modern scientific , educational and managerial knowledge as well as a contingent of specialty technicians and economic managerial personnel urgently needed in our region .  
They have achieved marked S &amp; T troop training results , sharply cultivating high-quality military talent , daring to reform and innovate , adhering to scientific objectivity , reforming training content , improving training methods , and creating innovative training means , to have made a prominent contribution to the in-depth development of S &amp; T troop training throughout the PLA .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .  Over the past five years , various major units , academies , or schools charged with the task of building key projects have persistently followed a correct direction ;  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Ideological and political building has been further enhanced , preparations for military struggle have been thorough and sound , notable success has been achieved in national defense scientific research and armament modernization , all-round backup capability has been markedly strengthened , and there has been a very big improvement in the army 's all-round combat capability in hi-tech conditions .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?  Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
( 3 ) Proceeding from the realities in the country and in the armed forces ; drawing upon beneficial experiences from foreign forces ; emancipating the mind ; seeking truth from facts ; boldly furthering explorations ; bravely blazing new trails ; comprehensively adopting modern scientific methods or means ; and developing a military theory with Chinese characteristics .  
After receiving the application from the leader of a topic group , a military scientific research management department of an individual unit may make a plan for appraising , testing , or accepting the relevant research results before sending personnel to do the work and shall submit in a timely fashion a report to a military scientific research management department at a higher level after deeming a research topic suitable for listing in a military scientific research plan for a unit at a higher level .  
Article 36 All units shall support mass activities of military scientific research ; urge or encourage personnel with research capabilities to conduct military scientific research in light of their work ; train or foster backbone personnel for academic research ; or make things convenient or create conditions for the personnel concerned to conduct research .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
This university regarded this project as its key scientific research task , put in several hundred-thousand yuan to carry out research and development , and directly applied several major scientific research findings to transforming the existing weapons .  Through nearly two years of painstaking efforts to do research and to tackle problems , finally , this university successfully fulfilled the artillery digital transformation task , thus effectively enhancing the tactical and technical performances of towed artillery .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
" Substantial Increase " in Three Areas ; Solid Foundation for Rejuvenating the Country Through Science and TechnologyThe Outline sets forth the main anticipated targets for scientific and technological and educational development as follows : By 2005 , the proportion of research and development funds of entire society held in the GDP will be raised to 1.5 percent or more ; the achievements in basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education will be further consolidated ; 
- - Zhang Xudong , a master 's -degree captain who returned after studying abroad , introduced a foreign " 1000-score rating system for vessel management " to his warship .  The system has substantially enhanced vessel and equipment management , effecting a significant qualitative change based on bit-by-bit quantitative changes , thus paving the way for scientific management .  
During a major contest organized by their fleet to review scientific and technological training , Zhang and his crew won first place in 14 single categories and became the champion of the whole contest .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
In the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , marked results were achieved in the archive work of our army : In the whole army , an integrated military archive system with full categories , reasonable structure , scientific management , good facilities , and efficient services was set up basically .  Corresponding rules and regulations for archive building and management were also formulated and improved .  A batch of high-quality archive management software was developed .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
Zhang Yingying , a student of the English Department , said that contemporary university students should keep themselves sober-headed , resolutely support the solemn and just position of the Chinese Government , proficiently master scientific and general knowledge , make preparations for participating in our country 's economic construction and national defense construction , and enhance our country 's comprehensive national strength and international influence .  
In particular , since the two countries established diplomatic relations , the two sides have maintained frequent high-level exchanges , enhanced economic and trade cooperation , markedly increased contacts in scientific and cultural fields , and maintained sound cooperation in international affairs . "  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
The mass media carries important responsibility in literary and artistic criticism ; it must propagate scientific theory and advanced culture , mold a good spirit , magnify a healthy social atmosphere , and promote scientific spirit to create a good environment for public opinion in developing flourishing literary creations .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .  
We are willing to strive hard , together with all countries in the world , for the institution of a fair and rational intellectual property system favorable to promoting scientific and technological as well as economic development in various countries , and for the creation of a fine environment of respecting knowledge , advocating science , and protecting intellectual property rights for all humanity .  
On the one hand , this reflects the serious harm created when " Falungong " followers practice spirit control .  On the other hand , it reflects the results of relaxed education , including correct ideological and scientific education , not interfering with feudal ignorance , and the spreading of backward and corrupt things .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
First , with regard to assuring the requirements of monetary policy and financial supervision and control and raising the level at which duties and responsibilities are carried out according to law , the bank has established scientific , highly effective systems for financial statistics and for off-site management and control . 
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
The standard attained by a country 's universities reflects from one aspect the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and is also a major expression of the country 's all-round national strength .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
The exhibition reflected Tsinghua 's major scientific and technological innovations as well as the achievements attained in the tackling of major technological hurdles , basic research , and technological research for national defense .  The fields involved information , nuclear energy and technology , life science and technology , new materials , energy and environment , and advanced manufacturing .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin listened in detail to the account given by President Wang Dazhong . With great interest , Jiang saw the digital television launching and receiving system and the special chips used for the system with China 's own intellectual property rights , the 500-meter-long high temperature superconductor material , biological material , and other products .  He also asked about the scientific research network for China 's education , application of low temperature heat reactors , and optical communications .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The level attained by the universities of a country actually reflects the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and this is also a major embodiment of this country 's comprehensive national strength .  The building of first-class universities attaining the world 's advanced level in our country will require great support from the party , the government , and all social circles ;  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .  This reform of drawing up the armed forces budget is a key step in this process .  
He pointed out that biotechnology is a critical area that will have bearing on national development in the 21st century , and it is also a new growth point for economic development , so we must concentrate our strengths and tackle key problems , accelerating the effort to come up with a group of scientific research achievements at advanced world levels and also speeding up the pace at which scientific research is transformed into results and becomes industrialized .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
For example , we can make use of advanced scientific and technological means to establish an appraisal and evaluation system composed of different quality indexes , which can integrate qualitative assessment with quantitative analysis and can link the appraisal made by party organizations with the evaluation conducted by the masses ; enhance the accuracy and rationality of our selection and our use of cadres ; and minimize the adverse influences that may be produced by man-made factors .  
Those who have attained extraordinary work results , have given an outstanding work performance , have made great contributions , and have shown a strong work ability shall be promoted to higher posts either ahead of time or overstepping their proper ranks ; and those who have achieved major scientific research results or have considerably enhanced the military efficiency shall be amply rewarded .  
With the scientific and technological progress and the development of modern education , peasants can master better work skills and richer scientific and general knowledge .  This will provide a major driving force for changing the structure of agriculture and the rural economy .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Third , we should tighten the efforts in compiling the needed teaching materials , and work as quickly as possible to come up with well-compiled teaching materials suitable for different types of cadres to study .  We should make earnest efforts to address the existing problems found in our teaching materials - - such problems as they are not systematic or relevant , and they have only " one size that fits all . "  We should tighten centralized planning and set up a scientific and rational system of compiling teaching materials for the training of cadres .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
The northwest region of Shaanxi , Gansu , Ningxia , Qinghai , and Xinjiang has a vast territory , a large number of high scientific and technological personnel , and economic characteristics , and the combination of Hong Kong 's funds with the achievements in high science and technology in these areas will turn out to be a big fortune .  What is more , the rich resources there are buried treasures pending development .  
We must provide scientific , safe , convenient and effective birth control services to the wide masses of child-bearing age , thoroughly set up technological service networks for family planning , pay close attention to strengthening the construction of technological service networks in farming and animal husbandry zones , and make efforts to enhance service capacity .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
Asia and Europe are also known for superior economic , scientific , and technological strength , rich human resources , and vast markets which can not be found elsewhere , and this has provided a sound basis for the two sides to strengthen bilateral cooperation .  
We should work out long-term plans for cooperation in accordance with the principle of ensuring mutual benefit and drawing upon each other 's strong points , explore effective concrete measures to this end , and deepen in an all-round way bilateral cooperation and exchanges in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , educational , environmental , and other fields in order to constantly widen the road of Asian-European cooperation and make fresh headway in this direction . 
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
The key to prevailing in warfare will be people 's level of scientific and cultural knowledge .  Without a solid foundation in science and culture , there will be no excellent art of commanding to speak of .  
The weakness in scientific and cultural knowledge has become a " bottleneck " constraining improvement in cadres ' comprehensive quality .  To break this " bottleneck , " it is now urgent to raise cadres ' knowledge level as soon as possible .  Work hard to achieve a big leaping rise in cadres ' knowledge level shortly through efforts to make cadres have advanced schooling .  
A : China-Venezuela relations have been developing well in recent years .  The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
Bian Jiagui , deputy director of the Beijing Garrison Command 's Political Department , said that extraordinarily rapid scientific and technological development throughout the world is embodied not only in economic fields but also in military fields .  Military cadres should devote greater efforts to delving into science and technology and continuously improve their abilities in every field .  Only in this way can military cadres set up a solid foundation for being competitive in the non-military sectors after their demobilization .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
They won 8 medals for achievements in special military skills competition and in " " revolutionization , modernization , regularization " , meritorious service reward for 51 man-times , and two distinguished honors of winning the titles of " advanced regiment in scientific and technological training " and " advanced regiment in overall construction " .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
The brigade 's new equipment is technology intensive and requires complicated operations .  In connection with this reality , the brigade made the training of a contingent of personnel capable of tackling key scientific and technological problems a core issue in resolving training problems and the improvement of quality and performance an important way to shortening the cycle for transforming new equipment into combat strength .  
To this end , while making efforts to build the command , operation , and technical contingents and in connection with its efforts to tackle key scientific and technological problems in equipment development and training reform , it actively encouraged cadres having development potentials to attend academic symposiums and research results reviewing conferences sponsored by the superior organs , research units , and colleges and schools in an effort to broaden their vision and enable them to have unclogged access to information .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
The officers and men have based themselves on their own positions and engaged in scientific research .  Through repeated exploration and improvement , they have finally developed a new model of special power distribution equipment with multiple supplies and functions .  
Besides such advantages as having a reasonable design , exhaustive functions , and being easy to operate and safe and reliable , this type of power distribution equipment can save more than 200,000 yuan of the yearly equipment expense for the unit .  The equipment has won the third prize of national patent and scientific and technological advancement in the whole army .  
With the coming of the new century , we ardently wish that Guangzhou and Tibet will walk to hand in hand even more closely , further strengthen and deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the economic , technical , scientific , educational , cultural , travel , and other areas , that they will continually create new forms of cooperation , expand the areas of cooperation , mutually use their strong points to compensate for weaknesses , and move forward shoulder to shoulder .  
Meanwhile , a number of transportation projects were completed one after another , including the Dalian-Qinhuangdao railway , China 's first electrified coal-transporting railroad , and the Changyuan Dongming railroad bridge , the longest such bridge in Asia . The completion of a number of large cutting-edge scientific research projects which meet advanced international standards , such as the positive-negative electronic collider , heavy ion accelerator , and national radiation laboratory , has demonstrated China 's scientific and technological ( S &amp; T ) prowess .  
Second , we should bring the role of universities and scientific research institutes into full play , make great efforts to carry out strategic advanced technology research and creative and basic research .  We should enhance our sustained innovation capability in science and technology .  We should strive to realize rapid development in technology in the domain that we have relative advantages or in the domain that is strategically important .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
Scientists and technologists are the valuable wealth of the Party and the state .  In the world today , the core of competition for comprehensive national strength is competition in science and technology , and the core of competition in science and technology is a contest for scientific and technological talents .  Implementation of the strategy for reinvigorating the country through science and education has set up a wide stage for China 's scientific and technological workers to serve the motherland and has created an unprecedented , favorable environment .  
He stressed China must sensitively keep pace with the general trend of the current scientific-technological development , fully assess the great significance of future scientific-technological development to human society , heighten their sense of urgency and , taking into consideration of the actual needs of China 's development , act immediately to catch up with the world 's advanced scientific and technological research and press forward to create a new situation for China 's thriving scientific-technological development .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
This is not only a good method of resolving the issue of a lack of funds , but will also bring in professional human resources , information , advanced technology and management expertise , and scientific marketing networks .  This will promote the enhancement of local products ' quality and the local enterprises ' competitive power in the international market , and will thus bring great benefits to the economic development in the western areas .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
Wen Jiabao required that the sixth national committee of the association continue to deepen reforms and expand the new scope of work on the basis of previous achievements , further the efforts of making the association a main channel for academic exchanges and scientific knowledge popularization , make the association a main representative of China in international non-official scientific and technological exchanges , build up the image as the " home of scientists and technologists , " and promote the development of its work in all fields .  
She has attached importance to basic clinical nursing and management quality , as well as to nursing scientific research , thus making prominent contributions to raising the level of nursing work and to training nurses .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
He has repeatedly pointed out : Our propaganda and ideological front is a very important front because it concerns the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  We should persist in arming people with scientific theories , guiding people with correct public opinions , molding people with a noble spirit and encouraging people with outstanding art and literature works .  
Liu Yunshan stressed : Over the past 80 years , our party has united with and rallied millions upon millions of people not only with scientific theories , correct line and magnificent goals , but also with the dynamic ethical character and moral integrity of the Communists . Since reform and opening up , and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress in particular , the CPC Central Committee has persisted in taking economic construction as the center .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .  
the basic network , scientific research and production , and information service will fully meet the requirements of national economic and social development and national defense construction and will rank among the most advanced countries in the world , providing comprehensive information technology and equipment support and basic networking safeguards for reform , opening up , and modernization . 
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
We must earnestly carry out the strategy of vitalizing Tibet through scientific education , spare no effort to cultivate all sorts of skilled personnel , do our best to promote progress and creation in science and technology , and make great effort to adopt advanced and applicable technology so as to give better play to the role of modern science and technology in the progress of economic development .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .  
With the development of reform , opening up , and modernization , the Chinese working class has expanded steadily .  The quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of their political awareness , moral standards , scientific and technical and educational level .  It has become more progressive .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
At today 's forum of the General Armament Party Secretariat , Cao Gangchuan , member of the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) and Director of the PLA General Armament Department , pointed out that General Secretary Jiang 's major address commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Party is a Marxist programmatic document , a new and glorious procedural scientific guide for overall advancement of building the Party under the new circumstances , and a great ideological weapon for guiding the entire Party in the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It will guarantee the satisfactory fulfillment of our major scientific research and experiment mission , guarantee the safety and stability of the armed forces .  It is a realistic test of our study and implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech , and balance every level of Party committee and leadership levels with the basic standards for official achievements .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech is imbued throughout with a scientific attitude to Marxism and the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts ; it upholds Marxism without rigid adherence to individual conclusion , carries forward the fine traditions while also being bold to clear the way to forge ahead , and proposes a whole series of new ideas and concepts , expressing major theoretical innovations .  
An expert working on a certain base of the General Armament Department said that faced with new situations and tasks , scientific researchers must strive to realize the important ideology of the " Three Represents , " to occupy the main battle position of the world 's advanced military scientific and technological development , and to become the advanced representatives for the modernization construction and development of the weapons and equipment of the Chinese Army .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
In the study of the speech , efforts should be focused on studying and understanding the party 's basic experience , the scientific connotations of the important thinking on " three represents , " the requirement for strengthening and improving party building , and party 's historical tasks and fighting targets in the new century .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
We must study their style of learning in which the vigorous promotion of theory is tied to reality , resolutely arming ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and particularly Deng Xiaoping theory and the important concept of the " three represents , " concentrating on the study of modern scientific and technical knowledge , market economy knowledge , and knowledge of democratic legal systems , etc . , striving to master our main occupations and continually improving ourselves .

base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
Military schools and academies and military scientific research institutes should use their favorable conditions to pass scientific knowledge to the people in poor areas , transfer scientific and technological achievements to production , spread the use of advanced techniques , help the masses to master science and technology and thus build up their ability to develop the economy .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's exposition on continuously building up the party 's class foundation , expanding the party 's mass foundation , and raising the party 's influence on society in the light of the reality in economic development and social advancement has provided the scientific theoretical basis for consolidating and strengthening the party 's leadership and increasing the party 's creativity , cohesive power , and combat capability under the conditions of the socialist market economy .  
publicized knowledge on relevant policies , laws , and regulations ; built up a socialist population culture and childbearing culture ; devoted great efforts to changing the backward childbearing concepts among the masses ; and have successfully enhanced the ideological and moral qualities , as well as the scientific and technological qualities , of the masses .  
Representing the progressive course of the advanced culture is also a very realistic need .  So it is very urgent to improve the scientific and cultural qualities of peasants ; the quality of the people as a whole can be improved only when the peasants ' quality is improved .  
First , we must continue to take development as the theme , economic restructuring as the principal line and reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress as the driving force in promoting sustained , rapid and healthy economic development and striving to double Guangzhou 's GDP in the next few years .

Since the first visit by President Yeltsin to China in December 1992 , the cooperation between the two countries in all fields rapidly developed and the exchanges between the two countries in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural and other fields became increasingly frequent and close .  According to statistics , in 1993 the number of visits between delegations of the two countries above the vice ministerial level reached 25 ; and in 1994 it reached 36 .  
Watching the exhibits , Ding Guangen praised the success of the exhibition .

The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
When studying the development strategy and ideas oriented to the 21st century , we must consider the software industry as a strategic industry of the state , formulate a package of supporting policies and preferential measures , and set up a mechanism for attracting and stabilizing outstanding persons with software talents .  Meanwhile , we should rely on markets to develop the risk-running investment industry ; encourage large enterprises , institutions of higher learning , and scientific research institutes to invest in development of software ;  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
Ministry budgetary planning implies that China 's budgetary planning is gradually going on to the scientific , systemized , and standardized track , and the openness , fair , just , and other special qualities that the budgetary planning should posses , as well as the transparency in central budget , will also be improved and increased further .  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .  Our current efforts to develop the country 's vast western region means a great development project under the condition of new science and technology .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
and eventually enable its government revenue to pick up and rise .  Insofar as international experiences are concerned , the United States began to reduce spending , enhance efficiency , increase scientific and technological investment , and consolidate its foundation and reinforce its internal strength in the 1990s and has attained excellent results .  However , Japan has chosen to raise taxes without reducing public spending with the result that the Japanese economy has stagnated .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
Female senior engineer Su Longxu , aged 37 , has developed over 40 scientific and technological accomplishments over the past 10 years .  Out of the total , seven were first-class and second-class awards for military scientific and technological progress , and eight items were awarded national patents .  Ninety percent of the scientific and technological accomplishments have been promoted and applied extensively .  
Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Facts have proved that the " one country , two systems " concept is not utopia or an expedient measure .  It is a scientific idea with great vitality and more room for development .  It is the only way out for a developing country to settle the problems left over from history and solidify and arouse all forces that can be aroused to make the country more powerful and prosperous .  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .

We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
It should actively propagate , popularize and promote advanced ideology and culture among the masses and develop a scientific , civilized and progressive ideological concept , way of production and way of life .  It should constantly enhance ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural level of the whole nation and become the disseminator of China 's advanced culture .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
Relations of cooperation between the two countries have been constantly reinforced in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural fields ; there have been constant high-level contacts between the two armies ; and exchanges are being carried out in multiple fields and at multiple levels .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
He added that apart from the gradual improvement in material conditions , a good academic research environment should include an institutional environment for scientific research , a humanistic environment , a good atmosphere for academic discussion , and harmonious interpersonal relationships .  
- - We must uphold Marxism , most importantly upholding scientific tenets and scientific spirit along with the innovative spirit of Marxism , be adept at becoming aware of and studying forward moving new situations and new questions based on changes in the objective situation , continually drawing nourishment from the fresh experiences of the masses created in practice , and continually advancing and improving our work . 
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
Development of economic construction and scientific and technological undertakings requires the Party and the country to formulate proper policies , the strong support of all levels of Party administration and government , the unrelenting hard work of the numerous science and technology workers , and the common participation of all the people across the country .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
This is the most basic requirement of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , as well as the scientific methodology of Marxism . Marx , Engels , Lenin , and Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were all adept at putting forward new ideology and theories based on actual development changes .  
Young people are in their prime , their thinking is quick , they readily accept new things , and they have an abundance of creative spirit , but the spirit of science must be firmly established , they must work hard to dig into scientific knowledge , and they must have the far-sighted aspiration of contributing their own youth and knowledge to the motherland and the people .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .  They should teach them to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and to consolidate their determination to devote their lives to scientific undertakings and their confidence to attain new accomplishments .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Regarding achievements in science research that are technologically ripe , have broad market prospects , and produce good economic results , the government should coordinate with relevant departments and concentrate efforts on speeding up their transformation and industrialization .  The government should also help science and technology enterprises and scientific research institutions that are changing their system grow in size and strength .  
Through international cooperation the Chinese science and technology community has extensively learned advanced scientific research theory and management methods , enhanced its research and development capabilities , and improved engineering and product quality . and has also gained good economic and social returns ; at the same time , they have also made their own contributions to the development of modern science .  
On the other hand , nine-year compulsory education should be promoted in a comprehensive manner .  Reform of the curriculum should be deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular activity bases and science museums to cultivate the scientific knowledge and innovative awareness of secondary and primary students , and promote quality education .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
Between 15 and 20 June , in the company of Zhang Dejiang , secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee , and Chai Songyue , governor of Zhejiang Province , Li Lanqing mainly inspected basic education , vocational education , higher education , and scientific research in Wenzhou , Ningbo , Shaoxing , and Hangzhou . He also held meetings with representatives of the educational circles to discuss issues on deepening educational reforms , comprehensively advancing quality education , orienting education to serving local economic and social development .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
The circular pointed out : All levels should set sufficient store by the education conducted in small , scattered , or remote units , including the teaching and research section , the scientific research section , the technology section , the medical section or office , the sanitarium for retired cadres , and so on , and should take effective measures to strengthen guidance in this regard .  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
This is a scientific appraisal made in a historical perspective and based on reality and great foresight .  It will largely encourage the business circles and all other social sectors in Hong Kong to make concerted efforts with collective wisdom , jointly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) government headed by Tung Chee-hwa in its administration by law , thus create a brighter future for Hong Kong .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
At the ceremony of promoting military officers to the military and police rank of general on 21 June , Jiang Zemin made a special emphasis in his speech : In the year of the new century [ as published ] , cadres at the divisional-bureau level in all services and arms as well as all military scientific research institutes are required to attain the level of higher education and the level of possessing modern professional knowledge .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
Military training by scientific and technological means is a comprehensive and profound change , which will have a fundamental , complete , and deep influence on military training , military struggle , and army-building .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
To make the work of arming the whole party with Marxist theory more successful , we must vigorously promote the study style of integrating theory with practice , adhere to the Marxist scientific spirit and tenets , persist in emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , and work hard to arrive at scientific , persuasive , and realistic interpretations and explanations on prominent current issues that require theoretical guidance and explanation , so as to make full use of the fundamental role of theory in ideological-political work .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
Taken internationally , science and technology are advancing rapidly with each passing day in the world at present , the process of globalization is gathering pace , the trend toward a multi-polar world pattern is irreversible , and the competition in comprehensive national strength taking the economic , scientific and technological , and military strength and national cohesion as principal contents is increasingly vehement .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
To put it another way , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future , with Marxism as the guide and the training of citizens who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the objective .  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
I am convinced , positive scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation among countries of different social systems , economic modes , cultural traditions , and development levels are beneficial to the relevant parties and the entire world 's development .  
It has been learned that compared with its predecessor , the second manned spacecraft with an unmanned module [ kong cang zai ren tai kong chuan ] is much lighter , even though it still allows space for carrying three astronauts .  In addition , the second spacecraft is much easier to operate in the cabin , and the distribution of the cables is more scientific and practical .  All this has laid down a good foundation for raising the overall standards of China 's future manned spacecraft .  
It became the first book which introduced China to the West . On 6 November 1970 , China and Italy formally established diplomatic ties , thereby opening up a new chapter of friendship and cooperation .  Both countries have made comprehensive progress in facilitating political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological cooperation .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
At present , all the five countries are faced with the arduous tasks of invigorating the economy , of catching up with the tide of scientific and technological development , and of coping with the globalization challenges ; hence the earnest desire to have a long-term stable and peaceful environment for construction .  
Over the past eight-odd years since China and Turkmenistan established diplomatic ties , both countries have gradually expanded mutually-beneficial political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational cooperation , and attained good results in this regard .  
The amendments to the customs law adopted at the meeting are conducive to safeguarding the sovereignty and interests of the country , cracking down on smuggling and criminal activities , strengthening supervision over the customs , expediting the establishment of a modern customs system , promoting economic cooperation as well as trade , scientific , technological , and cultural exchanges with other countries , and ensuring the smooth development of the drive for socialist modernization .  
They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .  Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
( 2 ) Professional software education shall be set up or intensified in adult or spare time education ( university of electrical engineering and so forth ) , and vigorous support shall be given to enterprises , scientific research institutes , and social forces to hold all kinds of software technical training , and to promote knowledge update and re-education among workers at work .  
The restructuring of scientific research institutions is conducive not only to making scientific and technological achievements market-oriented , applying such achievements in industrial production , and promoting the optimization , readjustment , and development of our country 's economic structure but to deepening the reform of government institutions , changing government functions , and making it possible for the government to concentrate on the macro - management of all industries .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Jiang Zemin viewed with great interest the materials , parts , components , and mechanical and electrical products turned out by the machine-building , metallurgical , nonferrous , petrochemical , light , textile and building material industries , the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Ministry of Education , and other departments , listened to briefings by scientific research personnel , and asked in detail about some of the production and technical problems .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
All publicity and ideological bases and spiritual and cultural products must be favorable to publicizing scientific theory , disseminating advanced education , and shaping good minds .  We must not provide the channels of dissemination for wrong things .  
In theoretical work , we must uphold the emancipation of the mind , do practical work , and closely link our work to actual conditions .  We must apply the Marxist stance , viewpoint , and method to make scientific , convincing , and practical explanations of major ideological and theoretical issues that the cadres and masses are concerned about , so as to unify thoughts and forces .

Drawing on foreign experience and taking into account their local actual conditions , Tianjing , Shenyang , Benqi , Nanjing , Qingtao , Wuhan , Xian , Harbin and other cities decided the boundaries of a community in line with the geographical formation .  
Since China decided to launch a manned satellite in 1992 , the spaceflight scientific research department has solved many key technological problems and mustered many technologies .  The department successfully fired China 's first " Shenzhou " spaceship in November 1999 .  
Hu Jintao noted : Youths are the most active and dynamic force in the entire society .  In the face of a rapid scientific and technological development in today 's world and under China 's current conditions of reform , opening up , and socialist market economic development , in particular , young people are playing an increasingly important role in our economic and social lives .  
First is to open up a new round in large investigations into national land resources , clarifying the resource situation .  Second is to establish and perfect the planning system for national land resources , as well as the scientific basis for real planning , raising the legal status .  
We must integrate the mass foundation activities with mass cultural activities , making abundant citizen cultural activities one of the important items in creating civilized units , civilized social areas , and civilized towns .  We must put efforts into providing even more cultural facilities for the people and providing cultural services for various aspects of society , greatly strengthening all civilized cultural developments , actively espousing a living mode of healthy scientific civilization , and constantly raising the living standards of the people .  
These experts have long been engaged in the teaching , research , and application of missile technology , and have had rich theoretical knowledge of their profession .  On the other hand , they have also had practical experiences in ensuring the quality of missile technology application , and have participated in many live-ammunition firing practices and other major tasks ; meanwhile , they have successfully tackled and resolved a large number of major technical problems that have cropped up during the missile-firing training of the troops , and have attained marked results in their scientific research .  
Strictly speaking , the reason given by this customer for his choice of a commodity may not be scientific enough , yet it does have a strong " humanistic " color , for loving one thing on account of another is only natural to all ordinary people .  
Against this backdrop , China 's foreign affairs work in the fields of science and technology will be carried out closely around the science and technology development strategy , and will aim at cutting-edge science and technology in the international arena .  China will conduct international science and technology cooperation of a higher level on the basis of equality , mutual benefit , and shared achievements , enhance the country 's scientific and technological creation ability , develop advanced science and technology , and serve the industrialization of new technology .  
The reorganized enterprises have tentatively set up a framework of modern enterprise system , basically formed a system of corporate management , and made an important stride forward in such areas as separation of the functions of government from those of enterprises , conversion of the operating mechanism , and enhancement of scientific management .  
These are the key tasks in the development of the west now and in the foreseeable future : Accelerate infrastructural construction , step up ecological and environmental protection , consolidate the status of agriculture as the base , adjust the industrial structure , develop specialty tourism , and develop scientific , technological , education , cultural , and public health undertakings .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
We should infiltrate scientific and technological progress into various links of the western development , expedite the dissemination of advanced applicable technologies , take great pains to develop a number of industrial technologies of a general character , and lay special stress on developing a number of new high technologies with special characteristics .  The state 's funds for various scientific and technological plans should further slant toward the western region so as to provide powerful support and guarantee for the western development .  
and shall consciously devote themselves to the cause of national defense " ; Section Three shall be revised as : " Shall have attained a certain theory or policy standard ; shall have mastered modern military , scientific , cultural , or professional knowledge ;  
( 3 ) Have the theories , policy level , modern military , scientific culture , specialized knowledge , organizational and command capabilities , go through school training and achieve the corresponding record of formal schooling and physical health required for assumption of the responsibilities of one 's job ;  
As a modern mass media , broadcasting has its unique advantage , as it spreads quickly , is convenient to listen in , and has a wide coverage and a strong appeal .  It has an important influence in our economic , political , scientific and technological , educational and cultural life .  
Hubei has outstanding natural conditions and rich resources .  It is nationally renowned for its scientific and educational undertakings .  With its solid industrial and agricultural foundation , it has the potential for rapid development .  
This cult organization has moved against the historical current , is completely antagonistic to the scientific world , has tarnished human civilization , and has obstructed social progress .  These have determined its inevitable fate of a rapid destruction .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must guide and organize high-tech research and development in the light of the strategic demands of national development and the demands of the market , and effectively promote scientific and technological innovation with a view to achieving our own intellectual property rights in order to develop a high-tech industry that is capable of competing in the international market and developing by leaps and bounds .  
Beijing is strong in the fields of science and technology , personnel , intelligence and information , which form a solid foundation for the development of the high-tech industry .  It must launch a number of major high-tech projects with autonomous intellectual property rights and strive to achieve real breakthroughs in the development of high-tech industry , the promotion of scientific and technological innovation and the training of personnel .  
Since the reform and opening up began , they have , in chronological order , undertaken the construction of Daya Bay , Qinshan , Lingao , and other nuclear power generation projects and accomplished , with flying colors , a batch of ordnance-related scientific research projects , including the electron-positron collider , controlled nuclear fusion device , low-temperature heat reactor , high-temperature gas-cooled reactor , submarine base , and space simulation capsule .  
The local authorities have made great efforts to thoroughly expose the true features of the Falungong cult and the sinister political schemes of Li Hongzhi , popularize scientific and cultural knowledge as well as legal knowledge , and increase the ability of the masses to recognize and stay immune from the cult .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .  
Although the overall international situation tends to be eased up , the forces of hegemony and power politics still exist .  They rely on their economic and scientific and technological edge to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries and attempt to control the world , thereby threatening world and regional peace and stability .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , sent a letter to the conference and delivered a written speech .  She asked all customs offices in the country to take the important thinking of " three represents " as guidance , administer customs in a strict manner , deepen reform , and turn China 's customs into scientific , civilized , honest , efficient and modernized customs .  
It was learned that in the 10th Five-Year Plan period , apart from readjusting scientific research or production capacity for military products , the corporation is also expected to further streamline production of key military products ; preliminarily industrialize its scientific research and production capacity for hi-tech military products ; further develop civil products with active efforts in setting up separate production lines for such products , in separating civil products from military ones , and in listing civil products separately in production as well .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
A relatively perfect system of agricultural science and education and a system of technology dissemination have been initially instituted , the contingent of scientific and technological personnel has been steadily expanded , the basic research in the agricultural sphere and research on new high technologies have made rapid advances , and some research items have held a leading position in the world .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Li Lanqing pointed out that since the first national meeting of agricultural science and technology held in 1963 , through the unremitting efforts of the agricultural scientific and technological workers and various sectors , we have basically resolved the technological problems in terms of agricultural quantitative growth at present .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
After that , we will take another 10 to 15 years to institute a new-type agricultural scientific and technological innovative system that is suited to China 's agricultural big power status and comes up to the international advanced standards , so that China 's agricultural science and technology will be able to rise to the advanced level in the world .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
fully release the initiative and creativity of the scientific and technological personnel , peasants , and enterprises in disseminating agricultural science and technology , adopt the forms of combining the rank of professionals with peasant organizations , combining the leading role of the government and the guiding role of the markets , and combining paid services with gratuitous services , and break a new path of scientific and technological dissemination that tallies with China 's national conditions .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
Personalities assigned to take charge of the scientific and technological work from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , personalities in charge of the departments concerned under the party 's central committee and State Council , principal leaders responsible for the departments of science and technology , agriculture , forestry , and water conservancy from various localities , the commended advanced persons , and some specially invited academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences attended the meeting .  
continually and positively play a role at the non-governmental level ; further push forward political , economic , scientific , technological , cultural , education , sports , and personnel exchanges between our two countries and exchanges or cooperation between our local governments in all fields .  The people of our two countries should push in an all-round way friendship between China and Japan onto a new stage .  
According to authoritative persons , numerous experiments on space-to-earth monitoring , space science , and space science applied survey research were planned for the current unmanned spacecraft flight test , including two space life science and biotechnological research experiments , two space material scientific experiments , and one space astronomical and space environmental forecast and survey research experiment .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
As extensive contacts and in-depth discussions have resulted in deeper understanding and mutual trust , China and India have come up with a consensus on a wide range of issues , including bilateral relations , international issues , political , economic , cultural , scientific , or technological exchanges , exchanges between governments or parliaments , exchanges between political parties and peoples , border issues , good-neighborhood , and so on .  
We must vigorously propagate and popularize scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific methods ; guide the masses of cadres in building scientific , civilized , and healthy social trends and fine lifestyles ; and constantly meet the growing cultural needs of the masses of peasants , thereby promoting the two civilizations in the rural area .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
At the same time , great effort will be put into developing rich and varied , healthy and forward moving cultural physical training and scientific propaganda activities so as to greatly expand the scientific spirit among the vast number of young people .  
While talking about Sino-US ties , he said : Last year , Chinese and US leaders conducted a successful meeting .  The two countries have enjoyed smooth economic and trade development .  Bilateral cooperation in scientific , technological , educational , cultural , military , and other aspects has also been continuously strengthened .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
Through vigorously popularizing scientific , healthy , and civilized modes of fitness among the broad masses , we should enable the physical culture work to play its unique role in uniting the broad masses , maintaining social stability , and promoting the building of both material and spiritual civilizations .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
- - Comprehensively promoting the strategy of " boosting Shandong with science and education , " sticking to the principle of quality education , leading scientific and technical innovation , and industrialization of hi-tech .  Shandong should work hard to attain a new leap in science , technology , and education , and realize the shift of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers to boost economic construction .  
Mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out and expanded gradually in the economic and trade , scientific and technological , cultural and education , and public health fields , and has achieved positive results .  
The dissemination of scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific spirit will be a long-term and arduous task .  This state of affairs is out of step with the great cause of national revitalization that the Chinese nation is undertaking , so we must make concerted efforts to create a positive environment that is conducive to the healthy development of the awareness of innovation .  We should seize the great opportunity of implementing the 10th Five-Year Plan ;  
The State Council in 1999 promulgated the " National Scientific and Technological Rewarding Provisions , " reformed the scientific and technological rewarding system , and set up the nation 's highest scientific and technological awards for the excellent and top-notch scientific and technological talents who made outstanding contributions .  
This essential move has enhanced the authority and influence of the national scientific and technological rewards and further embodied the party and the nation 's policies on respecting knowledge and professionals .  This move has also manifested the strong determination and firm confidence of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in implementing the strategy of invigorating the county through science and education and in vigorously promoting the innovations of science and technology .  Hence , this move has already produced and will continue to produce a great and far-reaching influence .  
The party and state 's ample rewards to scientific and technological personnel and the hard working and enterprising spirit of the awarded scientists will certainly and utterly inspire the national pride and self-confidence of numerous scientific and technological workers as well as the people throughout the country .  This will also encourage the vast numbers of scientific and technological workers to blaze new trials , initiate undertakings , scale the scientific heights of the world , overcome new challenges , and win a new victory .  
Practice has proved that the series of major decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core are correct ; all localities and departments have been effective in implementing the line , principles , and policies of the central authorities ; and the vast numbers of scientific and technological personnel , educational workers , as well as people from all social circles on the united front have made remarkable contribution to the country 's economic development .  
The responsible persons of relevant departments under central and state organs ; the responsible persons of the national committees of all democratic parties , as well as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce ; non-party personages ; and all the representatives attending the national Science and Technology Award-giving rally as well as the representatives of the capital 's scientific and technological circles , totaling more than 3,000 people , attended the report meeting .  
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
In order to help the infatuates gradually stop being dependent on " Falungong " and master scientific ways of staying healthy , we arranged for medical staff and sports teachers to explain to them that healthy sports and recreational activities are the only things that would benefit physical and mental health .  We organized them to practice Taijiquan and fitness exercises ; conducted the activity of singing aloud revolutionary songs , such as " No Communist Party , No New China ; "  
The troops were explicitly required to tightly grasp the fundamental link of keeping firm ideal and belief and adopting the scientific world outlook of Marxism in the struggle of exposing and denouncing " Falungong . " Officers and servicemen were told to distinguish the right from the wrong on principle issues , lay a firm ideological foundation , increase their political immunity .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
The four other guiding principles are taking the structural readjustment as the main thread , making reform and opening up and scientific and technical progress as the motive power , improving the living standards of the general public as the starting point , and persisting in a coordinated economic and social development .  
We are also facing the arduous tasks of reforming the education and scientific research systems , the administrative system , the financial system , the investment system , the taxation system , the foreign trade system , the social security system , the income distribution system , the medical and public health system , and especially the leadership system , the economic system , and the management systems in all aspects .  In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
It is important to bring into play the roles of the elderly ; and according to the principle of integrating voluntary participation with one 's actual ability and integrating the demands of the society with one 's personal interests , the elderly should be encouraged to participate in activities of educating the younger generation , passing on scientific and cultural knowledge , providing consulting services , and taking part in social welfare undertakings and in the spiritual civilization building of their communities .  
They should lay special emphasis on the study of the international strategic situation , high-tech local warfare , and the law of military management characteristic of the new situation so as to keep enhancing the scientific nature and effectiveness of their work of PLA construction and preparedness for military struggles .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on . 
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
He said , an important guiding idea on drawing up and instituting the 10th FYP is to take system innovation and science and technology innovation as the motive force in driving economic and social development , and this is also a scientific conclusion derived from the historical experiences of reform , opening up , and modernization in China .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
CPPCC National Committee Member Huang Guancong held that since China has a large territory with its different parts keeping their own special characteristics , it is necessary to scientifically study and reasonably plan out the program of construction of small cities and towns , based on scientific feasibility studies and in light of each locality 's regional and local strong points and weaknesses , resource availability , and population condition .  
Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .  We can not stick to the conventional way of doing things , but nor can we rush ahead blindly , kill the goose that lays the golden eggs , or duplicate low-level projects , not to mention merely paying lip service or practicing formalism . "  
We should persist in taking accelerated development as the main theme , bring into full play our advantages , such as good location , scientific and educational strengths , and rich natural resources , and , on the basis of the sound development scored in the Ninth Five-Year Plan , strive to increase our overall strength , narrow our gap with east China , quickly raise the people 's income , and ease the employment pressure .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .  
We will further popularize advanced and applicable technologies , step up the development of human , scientific , and technological resources , and solve outstanding problems in economic and social development through scientific and technological innovation .  
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries . "

In addition , the Government will establish an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to provide " mid-stream " research , which is pivotal in linking basic scientific research to its commercial applications ; set up a $ 5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading in the manufacturing and service industries ; establish a $ 5 billion Quality Education Fund for grants to raise school standards through innovation ; and facilitate technology collaboration between academic institutions and the business community .  
Through proper sampling design , the selected households for March and the first half of April together formed a separate and scientific random sample by themselves and data collected on them could be used to draw inference on the overall situation .  
" In order to enable the public to understand more easily the underlying scientific principles of the exhibits and assist them to participate in various types of popular science activities , the Science Museum introduced in 1992 the docent programme , which has trained up a team of zealous voluntary workers who make use of their spare time to provide service to museum visitors , " he said .  
While , there is as yet no scientific evidence to show that such degradation products are hazardous to health , the quality of cooking oil will deteriorate if it is seriously degraded .  The oil will thicken , become darker in colour and produce a rancid smell , adversely affecting the taste and the appearance of the food cooked with the oil .  These characteristics can be easily detected by customers .  
Notable increases were recorded in the import volume of industrial machinery other than textile machinery and electrical machinery ; and scientific , medical , optical , measuring and controlling instruments and apparatus .  
There is yet no scientific proof that genetically modified food ( GMF ) is unsafe for human consumption and as such , the public need not be alarmed over the reported presence of GMF in the local market .  
The people of Hong Kong have always strived for self-improvement .  We attach great importance to education , respect the elderly , care for the children , and are always ready to help in a worthy cause .  These qualities are often displayed in various aspects of our community .  Our international outlook and prompt response to new technological and scientific advances are the major factors of Hong Kong 's continued success .  
In an opening address , Director of FEHD Mrs Rita Lau said that although there was no scientific evidence so far to suggest that GM food was inherently harmful to human health , the Government was aware that there were different views held in the society on the subject and there was the demand for legislative control and labelling of GM food so as to enable consumers to make informed choice .

The CMP concerned should provide evidence to the Practitioners Board to prove that he / she has satisfactorily completed such undergraduate degree course of training in Chinese medicine practice or its equivalent acceptable to the Practitioners Board ; and possesses adequate and relevant full-time experience in Chinese medicine practice involving clinical teaching or scientific research .  
The volume of re-exports of capital goods registered an increase of 19.6% in January 2001 over a year earlier .  Notable increases were recorded in the re-export volume of scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and construction machinery .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
In addition , doctors in public hospitals may , at the request of the patients , prescribe items which have limited available scientific evidence to show their cost-effectiveness , offer minimal additional medical benefit to patients over available alternatives , or may not be considered as essential for the patients ' medical treatment .  
In this era of innovation and technology , both the government and the public have recognized that the advancement of scientific and technological knowledge and its practical application are key factors in economic growth and social progress .  
The re-export volume of capital goods registered the largest increase among various end-use categories , by 11.5% in March 2001 over a year earlier .  Notable increases in re-export volume were recorded for scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and industrial machinery other than textile machinery and electrical machinery .  
The re-export volume of capital goods increased by 10.1% in April 2001 over a year earlier .  Notable increases in re-export volume were recorded for scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and transport equipment .

A statutory defence to the offences will be available to the defendant if the alleged child pornography is found to have artistic merit or is for a genuine educational , scientific or medical purpose or for a genuine family purpose or that the act serves the public good .  
A statutory defence to the offences will be available to the defendant if the alleged child pornography is found to have artistic merit or is for a genuine educational , scientific or medical purpose or that the act constituting the offence otherwise served the public good .  
" The Science and Technology subject is an initiative to provide students with a broad and balanced curriculum .  It is particularly valuable to non-science students , providing them with additional learning experiences on modern scientific and technological developments , " he explained .  
In 2001 , the value of domestic exports by air for all of the top five principal commodity divisions fell , with notable decreases recorded for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 6.6 billion or 30.1% ) ; clothing ( by $ 3.4 billion or 23.7% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 3.3 billion or 47.2% ) .  
On the academic , scientific research and athletic fronts , our achievements were no less impressive .  Last year , six Hong Kong scholars were awarded Membership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , with the youngest coming from Hong Kong . With the full support of the community and effective training , our sportsmen have won many medals in recent international competitions and in the 9th National Games last year .  
Health care professionals and the public need more substantial scientific information to demonstrate convincingly whether Chinese medicine leads to positive clinical outcome , improves the quality of life and is effective , safe and beneficial .  
Ultimately , the success of Chinese medicine as a source of alternative and complementary medicine in international markets will depend on our ability to understand market information , regulatory requirements , scientific development , intellectual property protection , quality assurance , product standardisation and other relevant issues .  
Within this total , the import volume of scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and industrial machinery other than textile machinery and electrical machinery decreased markedly .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
Comparing May 2002 with a year earlier , the volume of domestic exports of scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and metal manufactures decreased substantially , by 68.0% and 29.5% respectively .  
For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were recorded for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 3.3 billion or 34.7% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1.4 billion or 62.4% ) in the first half of 2002 .

For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were registered for " electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof " ( by $ 2.8 billion or 45.3% ) , " professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus " ( by $ 464 million or 55.4% ) and " miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of jewellery , goldsmiths ' and silversmiths ' wares " ( by $ 345 million or 9.7% ) in the first half of 2003 .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
" Because science is advancing daily , it is most important for children in our modern society to acquire an understanding of scientific matters . This is why we incorporate so many detailed and colorful illustrations in our articles , to attract children to the topic and to stimulate their interest , " he notes .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
The goal of national park management is to conserve treasured natural scenic areas in Taiwan which are judged to be of national or international significance . Besides pursuing conservation goals , park administration is aimed at providing sites for scientific studies , educational training , and recreational activities .  
Why is there no science in Chinese culture ? " - - this kind of question seems unavoidably anachronistic today , largely thanks to Joseph Needham and his collaborators who have spent more than half a century looking at all the evidence concerned . Now , no matter whether in East or West , most people can understand the scientific achievements of ancient and medieval China and how far China was ahead of the West .  
It was in this environment that Needham used his prestige as a famous Western scientist . He not only stressed to those around him that " bombs were originally invented in China " but even suggested that if the Chinese had not invented gunpowder and cannon then the feudal warlords of medieval Europe would never have lost their castles , feudalism would not have been dissolved and the following social changes - - the rise of the bourgeoisie and the scientific revolution - - might not have happened .  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
The period of tsarist conservatism at the end of the nineteenth century emphasized study of the classics and intellectuals were not allowed to delve into the natural sciences . Because Moscow was far removed from the center of power - - then in St Petersburg - - it became the hotbed of developments in the natural sciences and established a solid scientific structure .  
On the other hand , Lenin , who had finished off the age of tsarist feudalism , stressed the need to industrialize and modernize the nation . This meant paying special attention to the study of science and engineering . With the confrontation between East and West following World War Two , the communists put more energy into scientific research that was linked to the defense industries . Even a lot of persecuted researchers were made to continue their work in the laboratories established in prison .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
The roots of a big tree : To place its scientific development on a firm footing in the world , Taiwan has to putting down roots in applied science first as a strategic choice . But Li Tai-feng warns that " a country that has become industrially and commercially developed only recently is liable to overemphasize practical applications and neglect basic research . "  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
Originally , no lead-containing ingredients were used in the preparation of pa-pao-san . Large amounts of cinnabar were , however , and because cinnabar was expensive and in short supply , some Chinese pharmacists substituted other mineral in-gredients , such as huang-tan ( yellow lead ) or chientan ( red lead or minimum - - the scientific name is lead tetraoxide ) , which are similar to cinnabar in color . The result of this misuse was numerous cases of lead poisoning in newborn infants .  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning . I hope that agencies in charge of public health will extend regulation to Chinese medicine .  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Early on , heavenly bodies were named after mythical figures , nations or cities or otherwise already deceased " scientific legends " Wu Chien-hsiung 's outstanding accomplishments in physics earned her the admiration of researchers at Nanjing 's Mt . Zijin Observatory , who named the star they discovered after her .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
Apparently the work of weather forecaster was divided into 12 hr . shifts on a rotational basis . And every five persons constituted a section , administered and governed by a head forecaster . After Jen Li-yu was promoted to serve as head forecaster , an unexpected turn of events turned him overnight into a star media performer . At the time , the Chinese Television System had decided to arrange a more factual and scientific weather forecast after the evening news broadcast .  
From a modern perspective , the ancient Chinese used the Solar Terms to integrate astronomical and meteorological observations . They have a scientific derivation - - the earth rotates at a tilted angle as it orbits around the sun . According to the different position of each location on the globe , the sun 's rays will land at correspondingly different angles , and in this way the alternating seasonal cycle of winter , spring , summer and autumn is produced .  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed . Someone who is hypnotized enters a trance-like state controlled by the right hemisphere .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
She says frankly that the thing a judge fears most is breaking a big case " in an ugly way , " when the physical evidence at the scene has been destroyed in rescuing the survivors , making it impossible to take samples which could be submitted for scientific analysis ( for example , DNA matching for bloodstains ) . In such cases , there are only the court witnesses and the eyewitnesses ' indirect evidence , which are much less persuasive .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
The books say , for example : " When the qi reaches the fingertips , the fingertips grow warm and begin to tingle , as if there were ants crawling over them . " These idiosyncratic descriptions are enlightening , but might it not be possible to measure these phenomena with scientific instruments ? It is also reported that when one reaches a certain level of proficiency in martial arts , one sometimes experiences uncontrollable twitching and jerky movements , due to spontaneous movement of the qi .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
His mathematical and astronomical researches included mystical topics rejected by modern science . To Fu Ta-wei , a professor of history at National Tsing Hua University , " Shen Gua was not by any means a strict advocate of the scientific method .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science . Teachers have carefully created a systematic curriculum , designed diversified teaching activities , and produced supplementary educational materials and lectures not part of the standard textbooks . When necessary , they undertake deeper and broader learning activities . The goal is to develop students with the ability to think creatively and with a spirit of scientific research .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
China 's rulers have supported astronomy since ancient times , and departments concerned with matters of astronomy are among the very earliest scientific research organs in the history of Chinese bureaucracy . An imperial observatory was established in 2000 BC , and its Qin dynasty successor in the 3rd century BC employed over 300 people . Astronomy has always been highly valued , and dynastic changes never resulted in a cutoff of support .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
A : The process was quite convoluted . In 1979 , we submitted an article to an American academic journal . The editor thought the findings violated scientific principles , as anyone with minimal knowledge of chemistry knew that molecules could not possibly exist in such combinations , and therefore rejected the paper . Perhaps to preserve academic objectivity , they sought the additional appraisal of an authority in the field , who also judged my assumptions to be too bold , casting doubt on the conclusions .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
head of the chinese delegation told xinhua that " the exhibition is a window aiming at promoting the mutual understanding between china and indonesia , increasing the exchange between scientific and technological as well as industrial circles of our two countries , and seeking channels of cooperation to achieve common development "  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity  
he said that china is willing to + expand the sino australian cooperation in political , economic , scientific and technological and cultural fields + in line with the principle of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , opening up to each other and common prosperity  
China EU relations have shown good momentum in recent years thanks to joint efforts , he said Leaders of the two sides have had frequent contacts , and political dialog and consultation have been fruitful , and cooperation in economic , trade , scientific , technological and other areas has expanded  
finally , kohl stressed that enhanced relations with asia will " serve germany 's basic political and economic interests " he called on the economic , scientific and technological circles to take an active part in the asia plan  
He noted that the maintaining of a long term and in depth exchange of contacts between the two countries is conducive to the promotion of bilateral educational , scientific and technological development , and beneficial to the advancement of bilateral friendly relations oriented towards the 21st century  
Shen said that protecting IPR and rigorously cracking down on IPR infringements are the requirement of China 's own reform and opening up , its economic growth and scientific and technological advancement The tremendous efforts and remarkable achievement China has made in this regard are universally acknowledged  
iran and slovenia also agreed to establish air links between tehran and ljubljana , the slovenian capital , as well as + cultural , scientific , commercial and economic ties , + the radio said  
Peng , vice chairperson of the Chinese National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , said China and Norway have witnessed growing cooperation in economic , cultural , scientific and technological and environmental protection affairs since the forging of their diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago  
due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
As for science and education in construction , China has achieved 124 scientific and technological research results , which are up to advanced international level And a total of nearly 480,000 personnel have received education in the construction departments of various colleges and schools nationwide  
In his written statement upon arrival at Jakarta Airport , Wang Hanbin expressed his satisfaction over the development of bilateral relations , especially the exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the economic , scientific , technological and cultural fields since the resumption of diplomatic ties seven years ago  
In this connection , special reference may be made to the Cooperation Agreement concluded on 9 October 1990 , which provided for mutual cooperation in all fields : political , economic and social , scientific and cultural .  
As the century draws to a close , the world is experiencing profound changes in the ideological , political , economic , social , scientific and technical spheres .  
We have shouldered our responsibilities in this regard and have played an active role in international discussions to find a workable and balanced solution to global warming based on proven scientific evidence .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
The Conference acknowledged the need to organize regional workshops regularly and provide expert advisory services with a strong involvement in the United Nations system , in collaboration with international scientific and professional organizations . 
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction management and supervisory tasks .  
Early warning and alert information gathered by scientific institutions and regional civil defence organizations on disasters are a prerequisite to rapid response .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
It is estimated that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
" Calls upon all States to encourage the broad-based participation of local authorities and all relevant actors , including the scientific community , industry , trade unions , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the national , regional and international preparatory process and to encourage a wide exchange of information and experience in this respect , in particular on the programmes of work and activities of national committees . "  
The greatest national benefit will be obtained if the exercise is based on the overall principles adopted by in-country preparatory processes , i.e . , the participation of civic leaders , the academic and scientific community , grass-roots community leaders and non-governmental and community-based organizations , the private sector and human settlements professionals .  
The influx of young people into the labour market has led to the emergence of acute social problems ; rapid advances in many scientific and technical areas have posed new challenges that must be faced by the education and training systems if youth unemployment is to be addressed properly and prevented from giving rise to many social ills , such as marginalization , poverty and delinquency .  
Firstly , in the cultural and intellectual area , as it constitutes the vision which guides youth in all areas ; secondly , in the aesthetic field , art and literature are the essential pillars of culture ; thirdly , science as the basis of progress in our present generation which is witnessing growing scientific progress ; fourthly , sports and military fields ; fifthly , public social service , and finally , the field of trips and touristic activities and hostels .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
Indeed , it is critical to the preservation of the heritage of all art-rich nations that their cultural properties be preserved in their geographical and natural surroundings and be available for scientific and archaeological studies in their proper context .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
In this context , our delegation notes with satisfaction the significant activity of major donor countries and of the international financial organizations , primarily the World Bank , to provide scientific , expert and technological assistance to the Palestinian people to tackle tasks related to the need to improve their social and economic conditions rapidly , strengthen institutions of self-government , establish a financial and banking system , and train highly qualified national personnel .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies . 
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on environmental and developmental ethics , in order to develop a common value framework between the scientific and technological community and society as a whole , and promote continuous dialogue ;  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) continued to carry out research in partnership with national , regional and international genetic resources programmes as a means of strengthening the scientific basis for its work encompassing in situ and ex situ conservation and the sustainable use of plant , livestock and aquatic genetic resources .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such technical advisory panel ( s ) as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
Calls upon all States to encourage the broad-based participation of local authorities and all relevant actors , including the scientific community , industry , trade unions , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the national , regional and international preparatory process and to encourage a wide exchange of information and experience in this respect , in particular on the programmes of work and activities of national committees ;  
By including this programme area in chapter 35 of Agenda 21 , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) recognized that development and natural resources management will be sustainable only if it is based on sound science , using the best scientific knowledge available and with continued research to improve the knowledge base .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
National plans and investment in science should further global environment and developmental observing systems and should strengthen internationally coordinated scientific programmes on environment and development involving relevant United Nations bodies and major international scientific bodies .  
However , there are several emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that are not yet adequately addressed by specific scientific programmes at the international level .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
Major constraints being experienced by the countries include , in particular , a drastic decline in financial resources to adequately maintain the various valuable scientific and technological infrastructures and , of increasing concern , the critical reduction in the scientific workforce in bioscience and biotechnology .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
Recommendation 1 , Catalytic role of UNEP in emerging environmental issues : UNDP should , in its catalytic role in emerging environmental issues , draw to a greater extent on the contributions of the United Nations system and of the international scientific and other professional communities , to ensure that problems of wide international significance receive appropriate and adequate consideration by Governments , through the Governing Council and other bodies .  
Recommendation 7 , Access to scientific data : UNEP should promote through Earthwatch a global policy of enhanced availability , within the framework of United Nations mandated programmes , of existing environmental data at the national or international levels so as to facilitate the delivery of environmental management tools intended for country decision makers .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based upon sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Incorporate the educational concepts of the Maya and other indigenous peoples , particularly in the philosophical , scientific , artistic , pedagogical , historical , linguistic and socio-political areas , as part of the overall reform of the educational system ;  
Regulate and support a system of informational , scientific , artistic and educational programmes on indigenous cultures in their languages , through the national radio , television and the written media .  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
It urges Governments and major groups , as well as relevant international organizations and the scientific community , to participate actively in strengthening Earthwatch as an international partnership to ensure an adequate flow of information on the global and regional environment , to support decision-making and to give early warning on the state of the environment .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The main objectives of the association are to further economic integration , develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea and strengthen functional cooperation in the political , cultural , scientific , social and technological areas .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
This research needs to be guided at all stages by users and from the perspective of gender , particularly the perspective of women , and should be carried out in strict conformity with internationally accepted legal , ethical , medical and scientific standards for biomedical research ;  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
There is danger that , due to scientific / technological backwardness , the Federal Republic may experience a period of " ecologic blockade " after the sanctions are lifted , because its economy will not be ready to meet the demands of the markets of developed countries who are the Republic 's main trade partners .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
those organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations , scientific associations and non-governmental organizations which , in accordance with decisions of their governing bodies , have incorporated the recommendations of the General Assembly relating to disaster reduction and those of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction in their programmes of work , thus contributing towards effective progress in disaster reduction in their mandated responsibilities and respective fields of activity , including the allocation of budgetary resources for disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
This reorganization of the international system on the basis of strategic economic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific and technological revolution , a revolution of knowledge that spread across the planet and brought about the most profound change ever experienced in the history of humankind , turning the world into one large neighbourhood .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
It is therefore gratifying to note from his latest report , contained in A / 51 / 390 , that Antarctica continues to play a critical role as a centre for scientific programmes and for peaceful cooperation among States and in improving our understanding of its environment and its dependent and associated ecosystem .  
As we all know , Antarctica is a unique ecosystem endowed with rich mineral resources , ideal conditions for scientific research , 90 per cent of the world 's fresh water resources and rare species of flora and fauna . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
The joint flight programme of the five Russian cosmonauts and the American astronaut included biomedical research under the Mir-Shuttle programme , experiments to determine the properties of structural materials exposed to open-space conditions and also the assembly at the Mir station of a number of scientific instruments intended for various experiments and studies under the continuing joint flight programme .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .  
Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
The second objective of the subprogramme is to assist governments to establish , maintain and strengthen national controls over the licit supply of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The third objective of the subprogramme is to manage the international system of control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors used for licit purposes in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
Working under the guidance of INCB , UNDCP and governments will ensure that narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors needed for medical , scientific and other licit purposes will continue to be available ; diversion of narcotic drugs from international trade into the illicit traffic will continue to be minimal ; and the level of diversion of psychotropic substances from international trade will decrease .  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Commending those organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations , scientific associations and non-governmental organizations which , in accordance with decisions of their governing bodies , have incorporated the recommendations of the General Assembly relating to disaster reduction and those of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction in their programmes of work , thus contributing towards effective progress in disaster reduction in their mandated responsibilities and respective fields of activity , including the allocation of budgetary resources for disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
It was stated that pure scientific , applied and experimental research relevant to natural hazard management was required .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
Parties to the Protocol on Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) , not yet in force , are also expected , as a second step , to negotiate further measures to reduce VOC emissions or their transboundary fluxes and their resulting secondary photochemical oxidant products , taking into account , inter alia , the best available scientific and technological developments , scientifically determined critical levels and internationally accepted target levels , as well as the role of nitrogen oxides in the formation of photochemical oxidants .  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based on sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Basic scientific research " : experimental or theoretical work undertaken principally to acquire new knowledge of the fundamental principles of phenomena or observable facts , not primarily directed towards a specific practical aim or objective .  
To establish , maintain and strengthen national and international controls over licit supplies of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors in a manner that ensures adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes while preventing diversion to illicit channels .  
Finally , a sixth objective is to respond to the expressed need of the international community for the annual consideration , review and evaluation of continuing developments related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs in the General Assembly through the monitoring and analysis of and reporting on developments relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs , including legal , political , economic , technological and scientific developments .  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
The fact that descendants of African slaves and immigrants from Europe and Asia felt more integrated in the Brazilian ' melting pot ' than in other multiracial societies might explain why physical appearance and the colour of skin - as surprising as it may appear to the Rapporteur - tend to prevail over any kind of race classification based upon legal definitions and scientific theories .  
Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
Furthermore , international law permits the coastal State to conduct only marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone , not " any kind of research " , as stated in article 14 , subparagraph ( b ) ( ii ) , of the aforementioned Iranian Act .  
implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
The 124 national reports received by the Habitat II secretariat confirm that national planning processes generally adhered to this pattern , including representatives of national ministries , public and parastatal organizations , local authorities , the scientific and academic community , professional organizations , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the private sector .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
During the last 40 years , the Congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
It explains why the Tunisia of the new era has opted for a national scientific development policy targeted on the needs of Tunisian society and guaranteeing increased protection of human rights conceived as an essential condition of economic , social and cultural progress .  
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The role of the universities , equipped with scientific councils representing the teaching and research institutions and research personnel and elected under a democratic system independent of the Administration , has shown considerable improvement over the earlier situation ( regulated by Act No . 86-80 of 9 August 1986 ) .  
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
When engaged in a scientific activity abroad a researcher is subject to the " official mission " schedule , which accords him a privileged status and allowances which are dependent on his grade but , in any event , sufficient to cover the costs of his stay abroad and , if necessary , of registration fees and travel .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
In addition to the relaxation of the regulations governing the establishment of associations , which has worked greatly to the benefit of learned societies - present in vast numbers in the early 1990s - the State has also encouraged learned societies both by contributing to their annual budgets and by supporting the scientific events which they organize .  
This strategy outlines Panama 's policy on maritime matters , with regard to its legal , scientific , economic and environmental aspects , and indicates the principles and purposes that guide the Panamanian State in its efforts to integrate itself in regional and international maritime activities in accordance with domestic legislation and international law .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries which produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
In conclusion , he urged all Parties to encourage the establishment or strengthening of national climate committees , as well as national and regional action plans for climate change , in support of the Climate Agenda , an inter-agency initiative to establish an integrated framework for international climate-related scientific and technical programmes , and reaffirmed WMO 's strong commitment to fully support the Convention and its implementation process . implemented jointly . 
The IPCC welcomed critical comments based on careful scientific and technical analyses , but many of the objections raised had already been considered in the IPCC process and rejected because of inadequate scientific bases .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fishery-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized , and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fishery organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;

In this regard , I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian people can count on the support of Ukraine which , with its considerable scientific and technological potential , stands ready to develop dynamic Ukrainian-Palestinian cooperation in the economic sphere , in particular in the sectors of housing and capital construction , water supply , education and training . 
At its fifty-first session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1995 / 82 of 8 March 1995 , aware of the rapid development of the life sciences and the dangers that certain practices may pose to the integrity and dignity of the individual and seeking to ensure that scientific progress benefits individuals and develops in a manner respectful of fundamental human rights , invited Governments , the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system ,  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
For the appropriate management of high seas fisheries as well as that of the exclusive economic zones , the developed countries should transfer the necessary technology to developing countries to enable them better to conduct scientific research , handle data and pursue fisheries operations in a more responsible manner .  We now face the formidable task of implementing the comprehensive global framework of ocean management .  
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies , financial and other resources and an enabling environment .  
The increasing costs of big science projects and a changing international research atmosphere have fostered the trend in the scientific community to focus on the development of large , internationally funded facilities capable of taking advantage of the climatological and geographical attributes of any country , particularly developing countries .  
On the other hand , it has been strongly emphasized that the establishment of networks of existing small scientific facilities should also be high on the agenda for strengthening international cooperation , particularly in geomagnetic studies , electrojet current measurements , solar photometry , astrometry , galactic mapping and optical astronomy .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris , including spacecraft design measures to protect against space debris ( ibid . , paras .  102-103 ) .  
Notes with appreciation the timely production of the new , comprehensive report on the state of the world environment , Global Environment Outlook-1,4 as requested by the Council in its decision 18 / 27 C of 26 May 1995 , as well as the participatory assessment process ( known as the Global Environment Outlook process ) which has been established to support United Nations Environment Programme assessment activities , and its components ( scientific working groups , network of collaborating centres , regional and United Nations-wide consultative mechanisms ) ;  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Briefly , almost all the capacity-building initiatives supporting the themes mentioned in Agenda 21 can be grouped into eight main areas - environmental strategy and policy , macroeconomic strategy , consensus-building , environmental management capacity , normative and legal frameworks , scientific and socioeconomic research , technology transfer and public outreach .  
To address the issue of the lack of the critical long-term data necessary to understand global environmental problems , international organizations and the scientific community have designed observing systems to make data collection more coherent and cost-effective .  
Despite concerns that Internet access may be creating a new social strata of haves and have-nots , electronic communications have the potential to increase the exchange of knowledge rapidly around the world in an open , easy and relatively democratic manner , which is not only useful for linking scientists and scientific centres with each other but also for opening up available information to ordinary citizens instantly on demand , reducing their intellectual distance from scientific information .  
Provisional Order No . 4 / 1994 ( Miscellaneous Amendment of the Organization of Voluntary Work _ Societies Registration Act of 1957 and the Organization of Foreign Non _ Governmental Voluntary Work in the Sudan Act of 1988 ) , signed by the President of the Republic , defines a society as a voluntary organization of thirty or more persons established to carry out voluntary work of [ a ] social , scientific , educational , research , cultural and religious purpose ( art .  2.1 . a . 2 ) .  
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
This involves improving competitiveness in telecommunications , continuing with the technological development of Earth observation , developing advanced scientific instrumentation , carrying out work in orbital infrastructures and acquiring techniques for future launchers .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
The changes accompanying the diffusion of ICTs create the need for people who can act as intermediaries able to coordinate , integrate and disseminate new information about the production and use of ICTs drawn from relevant scientific and technical research and the practical experience of ICT implementation in a variety of organizational settings .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development , and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
The purpose of turning their bimonthly meetings into a political / technical seminar , with the participation of the Commission 's and Iraq 's scientific and technical experts , has been to narrow the major outstanding issues to a manageable quantity .  
At its fifty _ third session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1997 / 71 , entitled Human rights and bioethics , requested the Sub _ Commission , under the agenda item Human rights and scientific and technological developments , to consider ways of ensuring that the life sciences develop in a manner respectful of human rights and beneficial to humanity as a whole and to make recommendations to that effect .  
The Conference has been recognized as a forum for technical cooperation , technology transfer and programme coordination for the countries of the Americas region , providing government officials , planners , scientists and experts from the Americas and elsewhere with an opportunity to address common needs , problems and experiences in the field of surveying and mapping , cartography , hydrography , remote sensing , and land and geographical information systems , including educational and training aspects , scientific and technological requirements , implementation issues and benefits . 
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level and low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people and the marine environment or does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
This is the most important resource possessed by our country , and the level of scientific development now attained is manifest in the existence of some 60 scientific research centres and an established body of scientists and research-workers that place Cuba on a level comparable with a number of averagely developed industrialized countries .  
The high technical and professional standard of Cubas scientific work force , allied to the major achievements in the development of the chemical-pharmaceutical , biotechnological and medical equipment industries , is leading Cuba to concentrate its efforts and resources on programmes that generate export earnings , for which purpose we are working hard to find markets in which to expand our exports to the maximum .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
At the same time , it was evident that the problem was a long-term one of unprecedented complexity , which could not be resolved without the concerted efforts of the entire international community , as had recently been confirmed during the scientific conferences organized to mark the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl .  
The Parties shall promote the maintenance and development , on a mutually advantageous basis , of productive and scientific and technological cooperation between economic agents , particularly in the development and production of modern goods employing advanced technology , including items for defence needs , through , inter alia , the formulation of comprehensive inter-State and intersectoral cooperation programmes .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The Ministers also agreed to continue negotiations for the speedy signing of a trade agreement , an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation , a protocol on the equivalence of educational qualifications and levels , an agreement on cooperation in the area of tourism , and an agreement on cooperation in physical culture and sports , and to draft an agreement on cooperation to combat illegal trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances .  
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
We are seeking to build a modern society capable of accompanying the world on its march forward and of assimilating scientific and technological information ; a society aware of the challenges of our time and working to meet those challenges .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .
