On the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the US securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the US economy , and that the New York Stock Exchange is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .  
Reporter Li Dadong reported from the Jilin NPC delegation : The NPC deputies from Jilin maintain that since its founding nearly 80 years ago , the CPC has led the entire country and people to advance from victory to victory .  The fundamental cause is that the communists have persisted in combining the Marxist-Leninist basic theory with the practice in China , and their conviction of struggling for the lofty ideal of communism .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
In the past , we won great victories in revolution and construction by overcoming tremendous difficulties and dangers , because our party persistently educated party members , guided the masses , united people 's minds , and boosted people 's morale with the lofty ideal and with the objectives for the struggle in every historical stage .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The ideal and belief education should be effectively combined with the in-depth education in the party 's basic line so that people may understand how the party 's basic line can turn the ideal into reality and play a role as a bridge between the initial stage of socialism and the more beautiful future , and understand the strong effectiveness of the party 's basic line since the beginning of reform and opening-up and the strong vitality of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , thus enhancing their initiative in implementing the party 's basic line .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In taking the lead in implementing the important concept of " three represents , " leading cadres should , above all , have firm ideals and convictions and take realizing the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieving the long-term , grand communist goal as their unchangeable lifelong conviction and pursuance .  
They should have a firm ideal and conviction , be totally devoted to their work and have a strong sense of responsibility , be honest and upright in their ways and have a down-to-earth work style , and be good at uniting and guiding the masses for a satisfactory fulfillment of tasks in all fields .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Therefore , we should guide our youths to incorporate their individual ideals into the common ideal of the entire nation , and to draw up a long-range objective for turning themselves into useful people ; and only in this way can we successfully arouse the tremendous and long-lasting enthusiasm of the vast numbers of youths in turning themselves into competent and useful people .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
During the four-year-long training in the military school , he interpreted the meaning of responsibility with his loyalty and acquired the pass certificate for hovering in the blue sky with excellent scores in all subjects .  On the road to an ideal , there are hardships to accompany one 's dedications .  
Over the past 100-plus years , the Chinese sons and daughters have all along taken the accomplishment of national " rejuvenation " and the building of an independent , unified , and powerful China as the ideal with greatest depth and the goal to be assiduously sought after .  They have fought heroically on the tortuous roads , one stepping into the breach as another fell , and accumulated invaluable experience at a high price .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
Practice has proven that firmly embracing the ideal of working hard for the motherland and people and persistently and dauntlessly working to translate this ideal into reality will not limit the development of the individuality and ability of outstanding talented people ; on the contrary , it is only in these fiery struggles that the ability and wisdom of outstanding talented people can be fully displayed and can the value of their life be expressed still more fully .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin also expressed ardent hopes on college students throughout the country .  He hoped that they will become people with a lofty ideal and people loving the motherland , will become people seeking the truth and daring to make innovations , and will become people with both moral integrity and ability , people being healthily developed in all aspects , people with a broad vision and also being broad-minded , and people who can integrate what they have learned with what they will do and can work in a down-to-earth manner .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
This requires that this party be composed of advanced people who have a common ideal , strict discipline and close relations with the people and the masses and that this party be able to struggle in an unswerving manner despite the extremely difficult and dangerous environment .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .  More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin analyzed the relationship between the party 's minimum and maximum programs and demanded that we embrace the broad ideal of communism and , still more , make ceaseless soundly-based efforts to achieve the party 's basic program in the current stage .

All party-member leading cadres , especially high and middle-level cadres , should draw a profound lesson from Cheng Kejie 's case on discipline and law breaches , persist in paying attention to study , politics , and healthy trends , and firmly foster a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and the concept of value .  They must be able to stand the test of temptation and maintain forever the ideal , conviction and moral virtue of communist party members .

Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
In recent years , given the progressive social diversification and liberalization of Taiwan and its distinct island culture , Taiwan has become an ideal laboratory for testing various postmodern social theories and conducting cultural research . Deconstructionism , psychoanalysis , feminism , and Marxist theory are not in isolated company , making for a bustling cultural scene .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
A new seaborne celebrity : teaFrom the astonishing beauty of 16th-century blue-and-white ware to the strange and gaudy ware of the 18th century ; from the curio cabinets of kings and nobles to the luxury dinner services of the middle classes , Chinese export porcelain captivated Europe for several centuries . Did the Europeans really never think about " technology transfer , " instead sticking respectfully to the ideal of a global village with a " global division of labor " ?  
To implement conservation work , one subject must be selected as a first objective . The environmentalist community can deliberate for a lifetime , but the disappearance of animal species from the natural world is like a raging fire , and we must quickly throw the fire alarm . In the midst of all the rush , errors naturally occur . People should learn from mistakes and move ever closer to the ideal .  
Wang argues that the ideal situation would be to establish " resource classes for hyperactive children . " Hyperactive children having a hard time adjusting could first stay in these resource classes until they showed improved functioning and learning impairments were eliminated . Then , accompanied by a special-ed teacher , they could transfer to a regular class . The special-ed teacher would continue to provide guidance until the child had adjusted .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
In the current situation , with cross-straits relations being less than ideal , if small and medium sized enterprises are having difficulty growing in Taiwan , we wo n't prohibit them from investing in the mainland . But , if it 's a large enterprise , an important industry , or an infrastructure investment , the movement of these kinds of investments into the mainland one after another is not beneficial to our national development , and we must take more stringent measures .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
At the same time , new standardized physical fitness tests have been announced for all of Taiwan 's elementary schools and junior and senior high schools . So balanced education is no longer just a distant ideal . It has become a trend of the times .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
Their attack on the formal palace garden was used to express their discontent with tyranny . Yet the natural garden , established as it was on the ideal of liberty , could also be used as their safe retreat from the world .  
He notes that modern national dress must have five key characteristics : it must be comfortable , artistic , modern , suited to the locality , and universal . He calls his ideal national dress shuya , which means " comfortable and elegant . " Taking the lead himself , two years ago he put aside his Western suits and asked a tailor to make a shuya outfit that Yu himself had designed . He wears it to work and to give lectures .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
Besides showing earning potential , responsibility , and trust , they say , the ideal male would also be emotionally honest , interested in life , understanding of others , open to continued personal growth , and always considerate of the woman 's feelings .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow . What he values is loyalty , continuation of the family line , parental benevolence toward children , and respect and devotion in return . All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
Huang Wen-jung relates that , as most golf courses are located away from the cities , the 3-4 hours spent in a round of golf allow players to walk around and take in fresh air , aiding respiratory functions . Golf requires players to stand up straight , stand firmly at the legs , knees , and back , and to squat down to check wind direction and the lie of the grass . Therefore , requiring the use of the arms , wrists , and abdominal muscles , it qualifies as an ideal athletic pursuit .  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
Says Liu , " These names show that society at that time had not yet come to hold the two sexes to such very different standards . " Although they were gradually beginning to use specifically feminine names alluding to a gentle and submissive nature , such traits as a resolute spirit and an agile , tough body were also seen as virtues in a woman . " The notion of the ideal woman being soft and weak was not so universally accepted then as it would later come to be . "  
I think that Lee Teng-hui has shown in this book that he has lived up to this ideal . In its ideological consistency , in its lucidity of thought , With the People Always in My Heart is a world-class piece of literature . As a politician responsible for protecting domestic industry , preserving the welfare of a nation 's citizens , and maintaining international economic and trade relations , Lee has had an extremely busy career , yet he is still able to conduct himself with dignity and aplomb .  
In Guangzhou , the ideal of constitutional politics was never realized . The government system there changed frequently and proved to be no more stable or capable than the northern regime .  
Changes that saw the feminine ideal turn toward exalting the sickly and the sentimental , toward women who were fragile and refined , were also reflected in ideas about manly beauty . In Dream of the Red Chamber , the male characters Jia Baoyu and Qin Zhong both possess a gentle , delicate beauty to outdo young women .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
The dead tree is the most visually striking object in the valley . The dense forest beneath the tall acacia is an ideal resting and nesting area for birds , and the acacia stands right in the middle of an " avian skyway " leading out of the valley . They frequently pause here for a moment to catch their breath before continuing on their respective journeys .  
Tunnel 88 was originally an air raid shelter . It was bored into the base of a granite hill , so it stays at a relatively even temperature , warm in winter and cool in summer . That makes the tunnel ideal for long-term aging . As time goes by , odd and impure tastes in the liquor are eliminated .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .

However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
Theoretically , composite ceramic molecules laid at thicknesses of 10 to 30 nanometers will emit infrared waves at the most ideal wavelength for keeping food fresh . Currently , industry has attained levels of 70-90 nanometers . The refrigerators employ a coating of this material on aluminum trays to keep fish fresh , and also on a carpet-like material to line the compartments for fruit and vegetables . They are quite effective .  
While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House . Zhang pointed out that his film was set in the time immediately before the first Qin emperor had unified all of China . At that moment in history , it would have been impossible for people to foresee his eventual transformation into a tyrant ; therefore , the assassin is able to place trust in the emperor .  
Many respiratory-tract infectious diseases , including Legionnaires Disease and SARS , spread quickly through closed air-conditioning systems ; extended-wear contact lenses are ideal breeding grounds for bacterial conjunctivitis ; in many cosmetic products there are bovine collagens containing mad cow disease proteins ; and " airport malaria " circles the globe on airliners .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 .

But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
It is my feeling that the United Nations and the Olympic Movement share a single universal ideal : to promote peace and understanding among nations and among peoples , with all their differences and their complementary features , by contributing to bringing cultures closer together and to promoting friendship among human beings in this world so often battered and torn apart .

New and necessary foundations have been laid between two of the world 's major collegiate bodies , which have the privilege to have among their ranks enlightened spokespersons from all over the world , which constantly seek the same ideal of harmony and coexistence on the vast and glorious stage formed by all the continents , and which raise their voices in this Hall for the supreme ideal of peace .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .

Reporter Li Dadong reported from the Jilin NPC delegation : The NPC deputies from Jilin maintain that since its founding nearly 80 years ago , the CPC has led the entire country and people to advance from victory to victory .  The fundamental cause is that the communists have persisted in combining the Marxist-Leninist basic theory with the practice in China , and their conviction of struggling for the lofty ideal of communism .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
In the past , we won great victories in revolution and construction by overcoming tremendous difficulties and dangers , because our party persistently educated party members , guided the masses , united people 's minds , and boosted people 's morale with the lofty ideal and with the objectives for the struggle in every historical stage .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The ideal and belief education should be effectively combined with the in-depth education in the party 's basic line so that people may understand how the party 's basic line can turn the ideal into reality and play a role as a bridge between the initial stage of socialism and the more beautiful future , and understand the strong effectiveness of the party 's basic line since the beginning of reform and opening-up and the strong vitality of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , thus enhancing their initiative in implementing the party 's basic line .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In taking the lead in implementing the important concept of " three represents , " leading cadres should , above all , have firm ideals and convictions and take realizing the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieving the long-term , grand communist goal as their unchangeable lifelong conviction and pursuance .  
They should have a firm ideal and conviction , be totally devoted to their work and have a strong sense of responsibility , be honest and upright in their ways and have a down-to-earth work style , and be good at uniting and guiding the masses for a satisfactory fulfillment of tasks in all fields .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .

Therefore , we should guide our youths to incorporate their individual ideals into the common ideal of the entire nation , and to draw up a long-range objective for turning themselves into useful people ; and only in this way can we successfully arouse the tremendous and long-lasting enthusiasm of the vast numbers of youths in turning themselves into competent and useful people .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .

According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .

On the road to an ideal , there are hardships to accompany one 's dedications .  
Over the past 100-plus years , the Chinese sons and daughters have all along taken the accomplishment of national " rejuvenation " and the building of an independent , unified , and powerful China as the ideal with greatest depth and the goal to be assiduously sought after .  They have fought heroically on the tortuous roads , one stepping into the breach as another fell , and accumulated invaluable experience at a high price .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
Practice has proven that firmly embracing the ideal of working hard for the motherland and people and persistently and dauntlessly working to translate this ideal into reality will not limit the development of the individuality and ability of outstanding talented people ; on the contrary , it is only in these fiery struggles that the ability and wisdom of outstanding talented people can be fully displayed and can the value of their life be expressed still more fully .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin also expressed ardent hopes on college students throughout the country .  He hoped that they will become people with a lofty ideal and people loving the motherland , will become people seeking the truth and daring to make innovations , and will become people with both moral integrity and ability , people being healthily developed in all aspects , people with a broad vision and also being broad-minded , and people who can integrate what they have learned with what they will do and can work in a down-to-earth manner .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
This requires that this party be composed of advanced people who have a common ideal , strict discipline and close relations with the people and the masses and that this party be able to struggle in an unswerving manner despite the extremely difficult and dangerous environment .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .  More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .

All party-member leading cadres , especially high and middle-level cadres , should draw a profound lesson from Cheng Kejie 's case on discipline and law breaches , persist in paying attention to study , politics , and healthy trends , and firmly foster a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and the concept of value .  They must be able to stand the test of temptation and maintain forever the ideal , conviction and moral virtue of communist party members .

President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
In the current situation , with cross-straits relations being less than ideal , if small and medium sized enterprises are having difficulty growing in Taiwan , we wo n't prohibit them from investing in the mainland .

Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
At the same time , new standardized physical fitness tests have been announced for all of Taiwan 's elementary schools and junior and senior high schools . So balanced education is no longer just a distant ideal . It has become a trend of the times .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved .

If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation .

In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society .

In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow . What he values is loyalty , continuation of the family line , parental benevolence toward children , and respect and devotion in return . All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
Huang Wen-jung relates that , as most golf courses are located away from the cities , the 3-4 hours spent in a round of golf allow players to walk around and take in fresh air , aiding respiratory functions . Golf requires players to stand up straight , stand firmly at the legs , knees , and back , and to squat down to check wind direction and the lie of the grass . Therefore , requiring the use of the arms , wrists , and abdominal muscles , it qualifies as an ideal athletic pursuit .  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
Says Liu , " These names show that society at that time had not yet come to hold the two sexes to such very different standards . " Although they were gradually beginning to use specifically feminine names alluding to a gentle and submissive nature , such traits as a resolute spirit and an agile , tough body were also seen as virtues in a woman . " The notion of the ideal woman being soft and weak was not so universally accepted then as it would later come to be . "

Changes that saw the feminine ideal turn toward exalting the sickly and the sentimental , toward women who were fragile and refined , were also reflected in ideas about manly beauty . In Dream of the Red Chamber , the male characters Jia Baoyu and Qin Zhong both possess a gentle , delicate beauty to outdo young women .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .
