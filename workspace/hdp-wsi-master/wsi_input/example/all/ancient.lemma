Jia Qinglin said : Over 80 years , especially over more than 50 years since the founding of new China , under the leadership of the CPC , Beijing , as a time-honored ancient capital city well-known to the world , underwent earthshaking changes .

Some people are still doing business much like their forefathers did generations before . Most of the narrow streets paved with granite slabs are now gone .

Now , it is recognized as Kuo Chu or national drama , since it is a genuine Chinese art form which upholds traditional virtues such as loyalty , filial piety , chastity , justice and righteousness .

The biggest reason for the decline of Peiping opera is the fact that its classical language is difficult for members of the younger generation to understand .  
Tales of the faithful dog rescuing his master abound in the traditional folklore of ancient China . Dogs have also served man in the art of war and defense .

"  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics .

Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel .

Its characteristic vice was also its greatest virtue : because it devoured anything it came upon , even evil spirits avoided it , and the Chinese considered it auspicious . Its fearsome features often appear on ancient bronze or ceramic dining vessels - - as a warning against overindulgence as well as a charm against evil .  
First of all , the belief that Chinese characters were sacred symbols created by an ancient sage led to their being cherished and preserved from soiling or defilement . In the past , nearly every town in China had a special building where written paper was taken for burning , a practice that reflects the common people 's awe of the written word .  
I sat motionless in the floral room , quietly gazing at the orchids , like a Taoist adept in ancient times peering at the heavens . Although the entire room had but this single lovely star , I felt as though I had been transported to the midst of a star-filled sky .

Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
For us " China fever " raises a number of interesting questions . From the land of marvels described by Marco Polo , through the utopia pictured by philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Sick Man of Asia coveted by imperialists , to the future world power predicted by Arnold Toynbee , just what attitudes have Westerners held toward this ancient country isolated by oceans on one side and forbidding plains on the other ? And why ? The Western Powers removed many cultural treasures from the country during the course of the nineteenth century .

Lee Huei-fan , an engineering student who lives in New College , had this experience : walking over the Bridge of Sighs ; along an ancient , silent , narrow alley ; opening an imposing carved wooden door ; and entering a quadrangle of flowered greenery , surrounded by solemn and classically beautiful halls ; everywhere could be heard the sounds of songs and music ; students , instructors , administrators , all sharing meals together . . . it is like a warm family garden .  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .  
Other innovations have included introducing a truly three-dimensional feel and experimenting with molds . In the opinion of Hsia Yuan-yu , an expert on Chinese folk artifacts , Ch'en Hui-yen has transformed the ancient art of modelling dough figurines . She pays close attention to facial expression , physical structure , musculature , old clothing and hair styles , and even details such as eyebrows and eyelashes are painstakingly sculpted hair by hair .  
Why is there no science in Chinese culture ? " - - this kind of question seems unavoidably anachronistic today , largely thanks to Joseph Needham and his collaborators who have spent more than half a century looking at all the evidence concerned . Now , no matter whether in East or West , most people can understand the scientific achievements of ancient and medieval China and how far China was ahead of the West .  
Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily . In addition to this the condescension of Western and Japanese scholars stirred up an intellectual " war to defend culture , " which involved working hard to glorify the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan . Add to this the local native style , and you could say that this is the most fortuitous event in the history of Chinese food since somebody figured out how to make fire from rubbing sticks together in ancient times .  
Perestroika , Glasnost , and so on gave Soviet citizens a temporary vision of hope and prosperity . But the subsequent conservative reaction , economic difficulties , material shortages , and the threat of national disintegration have swept this vast and ancient land . "  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
Offshore to the east lies the longest coral reef in the western hemisphere . Most of the mountains are covered with dense primeval forests , home to more than 500 species of birds and thousands of varieties of butterflies . There are sanctuaries for jaguars and baboons and some 600 sites of the ancient Mayan civilization , making Belize a paradise for naturalists and anthropologists alike .  
Nevertheless , since ancient times major affairs of state have been seen as the center of political activity , and are what most people think of when they think of ' politics , ' " says Yeh . This is a distortion of a paternalistic society - - promoting invasiveness , and lacking in acceptance and tolerance - - which defined the political core , but it is by no means the only or normal nature of politics .  
From Peachwood Charms to New Year 's Scrolls : Ever since ancient times , everybody from high officials to lowly peddlers has used these scrolls to display their literary proficiency or express their yearnings for the future . The joyous red-scribed scrolls , their contents ranging across the spectrum of hopes and propitious wishes , never fail to get the spring season off to a rousing start .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
In films depicting ancient events like Mulan Enlists , they employed the incidents and the words of historical figures to either encourage patriotic sentiment in their viewers or to vilify the traitors who had shamelessly sold out their country . Although this infuriated the Japanese and their Chinese collaborators ; there was nothing specific that they could cite as a violation . This made them intolerable . "  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
A magic time machineThe tale begins two hundred years ago with a great flood that visited the old Penkang River ( now known as the Peikang River ) .

Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
From a modern perspective , the ancient Chinese used the Solar Terms to integrate astronomical and meteorological observations . They have a scientific derivation - - the earth rotates at a tilted angle as it orbits around the sun . According to the different position of each location on the globe , the sun 's rays will land at correspondingly different angles , and in this way the alternating seasonal cycle of winter , spring , summer and autumn is produced .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
Those amazing Chinese parents " All things are beneath contempt , only education is to be esteemed . " " Only if you suffer can you surpass others . " The ancient sages have left many a pithy phrase to inspire us to greater heights . They articulate the line of thinking in Chinese culture which argues that learning is the only path to respectable success .  
The new mayor of Taipei City , Chen Shui-bian , has appointed lieutenant-general Li Tsuo-fu as director of the city 's Department of Military Service , because of his reputation for fair and upright dealing while in the army , which earned him the nickname " the Tiger . " But since ancient times the Chinese have also had the saying that " powerful people are as changeable as tigers , " implying that the actions of the powerful are as unpredictable as the patterns on tigers ' coat are variable .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
Chuo Ko-hua , a scholar of folk customs and ancient monuments who has spent time studying divination poems and who also has an understanding of Chinese herbal medicine , says that the remedies prescribed by medicinal oracles were not powerful and were mainly tonics , but they could sometimes cure minor ailments .  
In Chinese medicine , jing ( meaning both " semen " and " vital essence " ) , yuan ( " innate vital energy " ) , qi ( " breath " and " vital energy " ) and shen ( " spirit " ) are known as the " four treasures . " Dr . Wen Jung-kuang of the psychiatric department at Taipei 's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital believes that " renal deficiency " expresses a neurotic fear in ancient culture of " losing seminal fluid . "  
Entering into the museum as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary is like walking into a time tunnel of 7000 years . Through all these ancient eras , how many brave heroes , gifted gents and lovely ladies have come and gone ? Fortunately , we have a rich heritage of books , paintings and calligraphy , of objects that did not , like their owners , turn to ashes and dust . Instead they have become witnesses of the wisdom of the ancients , and a cultural inheritance .  
But Teng Shu-ping is also painfully aware that many of these jade artifacts have been illegally dug up and sold in mainland China , and not excavated by expert archaeologists . Such practices not only damage the ancient tombs , they also cause a great deal of archeological information to be lost . Furthermore , the spiralling price of fine ancient jade has indirectly encouraged counterfeiters , so that there are many bogus pieces about .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
In a disordered wooden box , he had packed away things that were dug up by a backhoe when his family was rebuilding their house . Among these objects were pieces of " Taiwanese jade , " of a milky yellow with a tint of gray , and streaked with curving veins , about the size of NT $ 10 coins , but thicker . Some people conjectured that they were ancient coins . Others suggested they were pieces of jade cut away to make earrings .  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
The 71-year-old Liu has many " firsts in Taiwan dance " to her credit . She was the first to earn a doctorate in dance ; the first to record aboriginal dance ; and the first to go abroad to copy original choreographic notation of ancient Chinese dance , which she then reconstructed and staged . Now in her sixth year since " retiring , " she is still teaching and choreographing non-stop .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult . By studying it again and again she came to appreciate the tremendous ingenuity of many aspects of Su Song 's original design , and solved many riddles ( see " How the Astronomical Clock Tower Worked " ) .  
This was the most bothersome problem for Kuo Mei-fang . " I was sure the clock tower could be made to be very precise , but only if it was built by very skilled craftsmen . This might have been possible for an ancient emperor to arrange , but for me as a lowly civil servant it was a tall order . "  
To keep the will of heaven secret , the imperial astronomers of ancient China were forbidden to leave the capital . Although treated leniently if they committed crimes , even in old age they could never retire or return to their native places . They can surely never have guessed that the lonely months and years they spent staring through sighting tubes to record whatever changes they saw in the vastness of the heavens would make such a great contribution to the astronomy of later ages .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
" At the Harvest Festival , when you put on your betel nut bag , it means you are grown up , and at this kind of social occasion grown-up Ami girls will place betel nuts and liquor inside the betel nut pouch of the man they like best . Hence the betel nut pouch is also called the ' sweetheart pouch . ' This forthright , liberated way of making friends has been part of Ami culture since ancient times , " says ' Api .  
In the records of the late Eastern Han , the " Guanglingsan " was listed as folk music current in the Han and Wei regions , but in the records of the Song , it says " the ' Guanglingsan ' is no longer extant . " Lin Ku-fang points out that the music of ancient China always persisted extraneous to statements whether it was extant or not ; it was preserved in a state so that at times it was hidden , at times evident .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .  
The ancient Egyptian monarchs that ruled over the Nile River Valley longed for eternal life and were wrapped up as mummies , in the hope that they would come to life again " like a water lily reopening . " Water lilies were often used in funeral ceremonies , and people would pray that the deceased would , like a closed water lily flower , have the chance of blooming again . In 1361 BC , the tomb of King Tutan-kamen was finished in Egypt , and was n't unsealed until 1922 .  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
Order is occasionally disturbed when an osprey-which features in China 's most ancient poetry-having finished eating a fish it caught fresh from the river , flies away against the grey background of the concrete city , startling the many ducks on the surface of the river . . . .  
But most of the travelogues which pre-date the late Ming concern travel within China . And although Journey to the West , which describes the Tang dynasty monk Tripitaka 's journey westward to collect Buddhist sutras , recounts a trip which went as far abroad as India , most of the book 's geography is made up . Kung Peng-cheng believes that Journey to the West is indistinguishable from the ancient Chinese idea of a distant journey to seek out a sage .  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
The Daoists " assigned " those who attained immortality to beautiful Kunlun , and with the admixture of some popular imagination the Queen Mother of the West , who in ancient times had been a tribal leader , was also transformed from a hideous monster with a panther 's tail and tiger 's teeth into a beautiful woman in her thirties , ruling over the Fairyland of Kunlun .  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Bridging the ancient and the modern Having painted ladies of the Han and Tang dynasties , Lee Su Yue then traveled back to the present , treating images of women more familiar to her . She uses light ink to sparsely sketch their fine appearances , with distant moods to transmit the different character of each subject .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
These unfamiliar strangers from the distant past left everyone speechless . Day and night , the archeologists dug feverishly for more ancient relics . About a month after the discovery of pit # 1 , another brick worker came running with the news that he had dug up two more heads some 30 meters away . He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
These would then be displayed in front of the home to ward off bad fortune and evil spirits . The people of ancient Japan would also gather medicinal herbs to prevent illness . These customs remain alive today . The Japanese have a May 5th custom of eating kashiwamochi ( rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves ) and soaking in a hot tub or hot spring filled with iris leaves .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
Chess instruction texts or books of recorded games from ancient times have rather elegant sounding names . One can imagine chess lovers reclining with a pot of tea and enjoying a cool breeze as they go over classic contests of the past , watching as the red and the black sides battle it out to see who can make their position impregnable .  
Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night . " No wonder some ancient chess aficionados declared that unless they were in contact with chess , their chi ( energy flow ) and pulse would become irregular and unsteady , and their brains would atrophy .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
As Hong Liren continues to reminisce , sometimes wistfully and sometimes with excitement , the afternoon passes by and evening approaches . With the sun still shining brightly into the studio , musicians begin to drift in . To either side the players of the pipa ( a plucked string instrument , similar to the ancient Chinese lute ) , sanxian ( a three-stringed plucked instrument ) , dongxiao ( a vertical bamboo flute ) and erxian ( a two-stringed bowed instrument ) are seated on traditional wooden armchairs .  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
The Chinese word amulet is made up of two characters : fu [ ] , meaning roughly tally or warrant , and zhou [ ] , which means an incantation or magic word . According to a number of ancient texts , the character fu refers to divine prescripts from the heavenly powers-that-be . This is a mirror-image of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system , in which the emperor ordered his ministers and generals about using written commands called fu .  
A legend dating back at least to the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE to 220 ) has it that the Yellow Emperor ( who supposedly reigned about 2600 BCE ) defeated his barbarian enemies by using a sacred amulet given to him by a heavenly messenger . This indicates that there was already popular belief in the efficacy of amulets as early as the Han . One ancient text claims that use of amulets in conjunction with the right herbs can even enable one to fly to the heavens and become invisible .  
With regard to some ancient amulets that are supposed to be able to inflict physical harm , Li takes a stab at a more scientific-sounding explanation . Take for example an amulet whose characters are written out using a combination of bodily fluids from a corpse and chicken blood . Perhaps , avers Li , the bacteria in the bodily fluids of the corpse reproduce by using the chicken blood as a nutrient . Someone drinking such a mix would probably get sick .  
He became aware of how vastly different the Buddhist carvings in the Yungang Grottoes were to ancient Greek sculptures : the East emphasized tranquillity , capturing the essence , whereas the West stressed unrestrained energy and realistic depiction . Western figurative art considered the human body as a geometric form , an approach which culminated in the cubism of Picasso , whereas the Wei and Jin carvings of the Buddha give the human figure a sense of life and their forms embody and evoke a sense of more of life 's elements .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
There is a Taiwanese saying that " the oriole is an emperor , the drongo is a disappointed scholar , and the kite is a beggar . " This is simply because the black-naped oriole 's golden-yellow plumage is like the robes of an ancient emperor , and the black drongo 's inky plumage gives it the air of a down-at-heel scholar , while the black kite 's rough and mottled feathers , and its habit of snatching chicks to fill its belly , suggest a starving mendicant .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Says Sun Wei-hsin , a professor of astronomy at National Central University , " The long , straight , narrow tail is an ion tail , while the hooked tail is a dust tail . " Professor Sun is impressed by the skills of the ancient colleague who executed the sketches of Mawangdui . He explains that an electrically charged ion tail trails directly behind the comet , while a dust tail is pulled toward the sun by the sun 's gravitational field .  
China 's rulers have supported astronomy since ancient times , and departments concerned with matters of astronomy are among the very earliest scientific research organs in the history of Chinese bureaucracy . An imperial observatory was established in 2000 BC , and its Qin dynasty successor in the 3rd century BC employed over 300 people . Astronomy has always been highly valued , and dynastic changes never resulted in a cutoff of support .  
In fact , in any land and age , the human longing for a sense of security is likely to keep popular belief in astrology alive and kicking . But with the extremely high-powered telescopes that are trained on the skies today , heavenly bodies are no longer veiled in secrecy . One question that Chinese astronomers might do well to address is how to resurrect ancient Chinese astronomy and make it into more than just a quaint source of astro-babble among people wondering which zodiac signs make for a romantic match .  
Finally the car arrives at legendary Danaiku , where you pass under two arched gateways to enter the Danaiku Ecological Park . This afternoon clouds and fog have come billowing in around the mountains , and the park 's meandering paths impart the feeling of a scenic spot in ancient China . You descend stairs along a path lined with ferns and other shade-loving plants .  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World . It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
" The false cypress forests that survive in this mountainous island with its wet maritime climate are rare relics of an ancient forest type that today only remains in parts of East Asia and North America . It well deserves to be called a world-class natural heritage site , not just a national one . " This is how the Ilan County Cultural Affairs Bureau 's brochure confidently describes the Chilan cypress forest .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
When a Japanese technician discovered groves of towering ancient trees on Mt . Ali at the end of the 19th century , the Japanese colonial administration hired a forester to survey the mountain 's timber . He found excellent stands of timber-red cypress , yellow cypress and Taiwan yew trees that were upwards of a thousand years old and that required as many as ten men to encircle . To get these giant trees to market , the Japanese began to construct the Alishan Mountain Railway in 1906 .  
Brougham was born in Seattle to a Christian family of German stock and was one of nine children . When she was 11 years old , she attended a summer camp at which Chi Chih-wen , an evangelical minister from China , spoke about his ancient land . On hearing Chi 's lecture , Brougham decided that when she grew up , she was going to go to China as a missionary .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
Our school has many famous doctors . One example is Qiu Maoliang , aged 90 , who was China 's greatest living acupuncturist , but sadly he passed away just recently . Others include ENT specialist Gan Zuwang , as well as Shen Jize , who teaches a course on the third-century medical textbook Synopsys of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber . His approach of combining ancient TCM texts with practical clinical examples makes the ancient books interesting and accessible .  
Ciqing paper is dyed with indigo to the same deep blue as appears on blue-and-white porcelain . In ancient times in China this paper was used for copying Buddhist scriptures with gold paste ink . It expressed the solemn dignity of the religious texts especially well .  
This is why in ancient times ciqing paper was extremely rare and valuable . In the Ming dynasty , one sheet could be exchanged for ten catties of white flour . When the Qing emperor Qianlong ( reigned 1736-1795 ) had his prime minister Liu Luoguo ( familiar to Taiwanese TV audiences from a mainland drama series ) transcribe Buddhist scriptures as a birthday present for his empress , Liu wrote them in gold paste on ciqing paper .  
The first specialist pharmacological work to record lingzhi was the ancient Chinese pharmacopoeia Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing ( " Shen Nong 's Herbal " ) , believed to date from the 1st century BCE . It distinguishes six kinds of lingzhi : red , orange , blue , purple , white and black . Today , over 100 species of lingzhi are known , and they are the subject of intensive pharmaceutical research in many countries .  
There are records of the medicinal uses of alcohol in China even on ancient tortoise shells dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties . " Alcohol is a good natural solvent , enabling one to get a higher proportion of the therapeutic content out of the raw materials of Chinese medicine , " Chen Chun-che says .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
The heavily attended concert included both ancient and modern music . The " collective memories " exhibition , with pictures from Wufeng displayed on the exterior wall of the lower compound of the Estate , was very moving . The arts market , the tone of which was dominated by traditional and folk crafts , had a constant stream of visitors . Through this event it seems that the people of Wufeng reclaimed some of their happy memories of the past .  
While Lai was in Japan he pored over the ancient Records of Artisanry , pondering and experimenting continuously in an effort to resurrect the long lost technique . But for years he was frustrated .

The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .

Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily . In addition to this the condescension of Western and Japanese scholars stirred up an intellectual " war to defend culture , " which involved working hard to glorify the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan .

Nevertheless , since ancient times major affairs of state have been seen as the center of political activity , and are what most people think of when they think of ' politics , ' " says Yeh . This is a distortion of a paternalistic society - - promoting invasiveness , and lacking in acceptance and tolerance - - which defined the political core , but it is by no means the only or normal nature of politics .  
From Peachwood Charms to New Year 's Scrolls : Ever since ancient times , everybody from high officials to lowly peddlers has used these scrolls to display their literary proficiency or express their yearnings for the future . The joyous red-scribed scrolls , their contents ranging across the spectrum of hopes and propitious wishes , never fail to get the spring season off to a rousing start .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
In films depicting ancient events like Mulan Enlists , they employed the incidents and the words of historical figures to either encourage patriotic sentiment in their viewers or to vilify the traitors who had shamelessly sold out their country . Although this infuriated the Japanese and their Chinese collaborators ; there was nothing specific that they could cite as a violation . This made them intolerable . "  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
Because of the rising and falling of geological strata and the alluviation of rivers , most dinosaur skeletons exist only in fragments ; very few are complete . But it is easy to imagine that the ancient Chinese were no less astonished by finding a " dragon skeleton " than their scientifically enlightened descendants are today when finding a dinosaur fossil .  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
A magic time machineThe tale begins two hundred years ago with a great flood that visited the old Penkang River ( now known as the Peikang River ) . An ancient village situated along the river was completely inundated , and the inhabitants were forced to flee , some moving north , others moving south .  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
From a modern perspective , the ancient Chinese used the Solar Terms to integrate astronomical and meteorological observations . They have a scientific derivation - - the earth rotates at a tilted angle as it orbits around the sun . According to the different position of each location on the globe , the sun 's rays will land at correspondingly different angles , and in this way the alternating seasonal cycle of winter , spring , summer and autumn is produced .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
Those amazing Chinese parents " All things are beneath contempt , only education is to be esteemed . " " Only if you suffer can you surpass others . " The ancient sages have left many a pithy phrase to inspire us to greater heights . They articulate the line of thinking in Chinese culture which argues that learning is the only path to respectable success .  
The new mayor of Taipei City , Chen Shui-bian , has appointed lieutenant-general Li Tsuo-fu as director of the city 's Department of Military Service , because of his reputation for fair and upright dealing while in the army , which earned him the nickname " the Tiger . " But since ancient times the Chinese have also had the saying that " powerful people are as changeable as tigers , " implying that the actions of the powerful are as unpredictable as the patterns on tigers ' coat are variable .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
Chuo Ko-hua , a scholar of folk customs and ancient monuments who has spent time studying divination poems and who also has an understanding of Chinese herbal medicine , says that the remedies prescribed by medicinal oracles were not powerful and were mainly tonics , but they could sometimes cure minor ailments .  
In Chinese medicine , jing ( meaning both " semen " and " vital essence " ) , yuan ( " innate vital energy " ) , qi ( " breath " and " vital energy " ) and shen ( " spirit " ) are known as the " four treasures . " Dr . Wen Jung-kuang of the psychiatric department at Taipei 's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital believes that " renal deficiency " expresses a neurotic fear in ancient culture of " losing seminal fluid . "  
Entering into the museum as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary is like walking into a time tunnel of 7000 years . Through all these ancient eras , how many brave heroes , gifted gents and lovely ladies have come and gone ? Fortunately , we have a rich heritage of books , paintings and calligraphy , of objects that did not , like their owners , turn to ashes and dust . Instead they have become witnesses of the wisdom of the ancients , and a cultural inheritance .  
But Teng Shu-ping is also painfully aware that many of these jade artifacts have been illegally dug up and sold in mainland China , and not excavated by expert archaeologists . Such practices not only damage the ancient tombs , they also cause a great deal of archeological information to be lost . Furthermore , the spiralling price of fine ancient jade has indirectly encouraged counterfeiters , so that there are many bogus pieces about .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
In a disordered wooden box , he had packed away things that were dug up by a backhoe when his family was rebuilding their house . Among these objects were pieces of " Taiwanese jade , " of a milky yellow with a tint of gray , and streaked with curving veins , about the size of NT $ 10 coins , but thicker . Some people conjectured that they were ancient coins . Others suggested they were pieces of jade cut away to make earrings .  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
The 71-year-old Liu has many " firsts in Taiwan dance " to her credit . She was the first to earn a doctorate in dance ; the first to record aboriginal dance ; and the first to go abroad to copy original choreographic notation of ancient Chinese dance , which she then reconstructed and staged . Now in her sixth year since " retiring , " she is still teaching and choreographing non-stop .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult . By studying it again and again she came to appreciate the tremendous ingenuity of many aspects of Su Song 's original design , and solved many riddles ( see " How the Astronomical Clock Tower Worked " ) .  
This was the most bothersome problem for Kuo Mei-fang . " I was sure the clock tower could be made to be very precise , but only if it was built by very skilled craftsmen . This might have been possible for an ancient emperor to arrange , but for me as a lowly civil servant it was a tall order . "  
To keep the will of heaven secret , the imperial astronomers of ancient China were forbidden to leave the capital . Although treated leniently if they committed crimes , even in old age they could never retire or return to their native places . They can surely never have guessed that the lonely months and years they spent staring through sighting tubes to record whatever changes they saw in the vastness of the heavens would make such a great contribution to the astronomy of later ages .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
" At the Harvest Festival , when you put on your betel nut bag , it means you are grown up , and at this kind of social occasion grown-up Ami girls will place betel nuts and liquor inside the betel nut pouch of the man they like best . Hence the betel nut pouch is also called the ' sweetheart pouch . ' This forthright , liberated way of making friends has been part of Ami culture since ancient times , " says ' Api .  
In the records of the late Eastern Han , the " Guanglingsan " was listed as folk music current in the Han and Wei regions , but in the records of the Song , it says " the ' Guanglingsan ' is no longer extant . " Lin Ku-fang points out that the music of ancient China always persisted extraneous to statements whether it was extant or not ; it was preserved in a state so that at times it was hidden , at times evident .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .  
The ancient Egyptian monarchs that ruled over the Nile River Valley longed for eternal life and were wrapped up as mummies , in the hope that they would come to life again " like a water lily reopening . " Water lilies were often used in funeral ceremonies , and people would pray that the deceased would , like a closed water lily flower , have the chance of blooming again . In 1361 BC , the tomb of King Tutan-kamen was finished in Egypt , and was n't unsealed until 1922 .  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
Order is occasionally disturbed when an osprey-which features in China 's most ancient poetry-having finished eating a fish it caught fresh from the river , flies away against the grey background of the concrete city , startling the many ducks on the surface of the river . . . .  
But most of the travelogues which pre-date the late Ming concern travel within China . And although Journey to the West , which describes the Tang dynasty monk Tripitaka 's journey westward to collect Buddhist sutras , recounts a trip which went as far abroad as India , most of the book 's geography is made up . Kung Peng-cheng believes that Journey to the West is indistinguishable from the ancient Chinese idea of a distant journey to seek out a sage .  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
The Daoists " assigned " those who attained immortality to beautiful Kunlun , and with the admixture of some popular imagination the Queen Mother of the West , who in ancient times had been a tribal leader , was also transformed from a hideous monster with a panther 's tail and tiger 's teeth into a beautiful woman in her thirties , ruling over the Fairyland of Kunlun .  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Bridging the ancient and the modern Having painted ladies of the Han and Tang dynasties , Lee Su Yue then traveled back to the present , treating images of women more familiar to her . She uses light ink to sparsely sketch their fine appearances , with distant moods to transmit the different character of each subject .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
These unfamiliar strangers from the distant past left everyone speechless . Day and night , the archeologists dug feverishly for more ancient relics . About a month after the discovery of pit # 1 , another brick worker came running with the news that he had dug up two more heads some 30 meters away . He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
These would then be displayed in front of the home to ward off bad fortune and evil spirits . The people of ancient Japan would also gather medicinal herbs to prevent illness . These customs remain alive today . The Japanese have a May 5th custom of eating kashiwamochi ( rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves ) and soaking in a hot tub or hot spring filled with iris leaves .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
Chess instruction texts or books of recorded games from ancient times have rather elegant sounding names . One can imagine chess lovers reclining with a pot of tea and enjoying a cool breeze as they go over classic contests of the past , watching as the red and the black sides battle it out to see who can make their position impregnable .  
Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night . " No wonder some ancient chess aficionados declared that unless they were in contact with chess , their chi ( energy flow ) and pulse would become irregular and unsteady , and their brains would atrophy .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
As Hong Liren continues to reminisce , sometimes wistfully and sometimes with excitement , the afternoon passes by and evening approaches . With the sun still shining brightly into the studio , musicians begin to drift in . To either side the players of the pipa ( a plucked string instrument , similar to the ancient Chinese lute ) , sanxian ( a three-stringed plucked instrument ) , dongxiao ( a vertical bamboo flute ) and erxian ( a two-stringed bowed instrument ) are seated on traditional wooden armchairs .  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
The Chinese word amulet is made up of two characters : fu [ ] , meaning roughly tally or warrant , and zhou [ ] , which means an incantation or magic word . According to a number of ancient texts , the character fu refers to divine prescripts from the heavenly powers-that-be . This is a mirror-image of the traditional Chinese bureaucratic system , in which the emperor ordered his ministers and generals about using written commands called fu .  
A legend dating back at least to the Han dynasty ( 206 BCE to 220 ) has it that the Yellow Emperor ( who supposedly reigned about 2600 BCE ) defeated his barbarian enemies by using a sacred amulet given to him by a heavenly messenger . This indicates that there was already popular belief in the efficacy of amulets as early as the Han . One ancient text claims that use of amulets in conjunction with the right herbs can even enable one to fly to the heavens and become invisible .  
With regard to some ancient amulets that are supposed to be able to inflict physical harm , Li takes a stab at a more scientific-sounding explanation . Take for example an amulet whose characters are written out using a combination of bodily fluids from a corpse and chicken blood . Perhaps , avers Li , the bacteria in the bodily fluids of the corpse reproduce by using the chicken blood as a nutrient . Someone drinking such a mix would probably get sick .  
He became aware of how vastly different the Buddhist carvings in the Yungang Grottoes were to ancient Greek sculptures : the East emphasized tranquillity , capturing the essence , whereas the West stressed unrestrained energy and realistic depiction . Western figurative art considered the human body as a geometric form , an approach which culminated in the cubism of Picasso , whereas the Wei and Jin carvings of the Buddha give the human figure a sense of life and their forms embody and evoke a sense of more of life 's elements .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
There is a Taiwanese saying that " the oriole is an emperor , the drongo is a disappointed scholar , and the kite is a beggar . " This is simply because the black-naped oriole 's golden-yellow plumage is like the robes of an ancient emperor , and the black drongo 's inky plumage gives it the air of a down-at-heel scholar , while the black kite 's rough and mottled feathers , and its habit of snatching chicks to fill its belly , suggest a starving mendicant .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Says Sun Wei-hsin , a professor of astronomy at National Central University , " The long , straight , narrow tail is an ion tail , while the hooked tail is a dust tail . " Professor Sun is impressed by the skills of the ancient colleague who executed the sketches of Mawangdui . He explains that an electrically charged ion tail trails directly behind the comet , while a dust tail is pulled toward the sun by the sun 's gravitational field .  
China 's rulers have supported astronomy since ancient times , and departments concerned with matters of astronomy are among the very earliest scientific research organs in the history of Chinese bureaucracy . An imperial observatory was established in 2000 BC , and its Qin dynasty successor in the 3rd century BC employed over 300 people . Astronomy has always been highly valued , and dynastic changes never resulted in a cutoff of support .  
In fact , in any land and age , the human longing for a sense of security is likely to keep popular belief in astrology alive and kicking . But with the extremely high-powered telescopes that are trained on the skies today , heavenly bodies are no longer veiled in secrecy . One question that Chinese astronomers might do well to address is how to resurrect ancient Chinese astronomy and make it into more than just a quaint source of astro-babble among people wondering which zodiac signs make for a romantic match .  
Finally the car arrives at legendary Danaiku , where you pass under two arched gateways to enter the Danaiku Ecological Park .
