The exhibit also reproduces a beautiful stream paved with small , closely packed dark-gray pebbles interspersed with larger yellowish pebbles .  
The function of the garden , where you can chat and exchange ideas , is kind of like the role a museum plays as it attempts to communicate its message to society . The paper museum has already weathered one serious storm in its short existence , and it has proved to be a hardy survivor , organizing a number of outstanding temporary exhibits . There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
With a tone of deep reflection , Mulroney affirms , " Because of him , we 've come to see a beautiful home that we never noticed before , and we 've become aware that it will easily be destroyed if we are n't careful , just like in Nebraska , where tens of thousands of buffalo trod the plains as far as the eye could see , and the native Americans lived by following the buffalo herds that spread out like a sea between the earth and sky .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
She says that at the beginning their limbs were stiff and they were rather inhibited and unwilling to express themselves , and were always looking down at the floor . But as they gradually grew more practiced and skillful , they also learned to open up and display their emotions , and in this way their dancing became more and more confident and beautiful .  
West Lake in Hangzhou is n't famous just for its beauty , but also for the fact that it was there that Xu Xian met his star-crossed lover , the beautiful Bai Niang-niang ( a snake spirit who took a fancy to Xu and changed into human form to marry him ) . Writers have penned moving descriptions of their love story , and no Chinese can visit the lake without thinking of the fabled romance between man and enchantress .  
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; Palau 's land scenery is also absorbing . The " Rock Islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .  
Unlike Taiwan 's many man-made lakes and ponds , which are often planted with water lily and lotus , this pond is home to the little-known Taiwan brandy bottle , a species endemic to Taiwan . Over half the surface of the water is covered with this beautiful plant 's oval leaves and yellow blossoms .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
In the early 1980s his book A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction made him a celebrity in Beijing cultural circles , and was known as one of the " four beautiful kites launched into China 's broad , lonely skies . " But because the ideas in the book went against the officially promoted doctrine of social realism , and tended towards Western modernism , Gao 's work was suppressed by the communist authorities and he went into exile overseas .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers ( as used in Chinese knotting ) along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland .

Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
But with a combination of superb cinematography , fine musical scores , and gorgeous stars in a single package , something clicks . The Korean shows appeal most to viewers who already have their own share of life experiences , enabling them to watch what might be their own stories , retold onscreen before them , rendered beautiful and poetic , with all of life 's wild storms , dreams , and regrets .  
This happened during a leadership class when O-Young left the trail and fell behind the group in order to photograph some beautiful mountain scenery . Trying to catch up , he did what he was accustomed to do in Taiwan : he took a shortcut . When he came out ahead of the instructor , he was feeling mighty pleased with himself , only to be rebuked by the entire team .  
There are a dazzling variety of intricately shaped sacred turtle images large and small , with past and present examples that include an enormous rice turtle weighing 8000 Taiwanese catties ( 4800 kg ) , a solid-gold electric turtle made of 230 taels ( about 8.6 kg ) of gold , and " money turtles " made up of stacks of shiny new coins . But whatever the form , all carry the same message : hope for a beautiful life in the new year .  
At the same time , his work is quite unique : dreamy soft landscapes like Monet 's with sharp , abstract , eye-catching colors . When he paints people , the beautiful women of his paintings always have clear and bright eyes that are overly large for their faces . When he paints reflections in water , the reflections are clearer than what they are reflecting . Things in the background of his paintings might be overly large , and things in the foreground overly small . . . .  
The gleaming white Hsiyu Lighthouse , located at the island 's southwestern tip , guides ships as they ply between Xiamen , Penghu , and Taiwan , and fishermen working the seas to the west of Penghu depend on it in their nighttime operations .

The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
" People in society do not understand the costs of divorce , " says Chen . Reading about scandals and breakups among celebrities every day in the media , many people get the erroneous impression that divorce is something fashionable , even an essential part of an interesting and colorful life . They imagine that after divorce a man will be surrounded by beautiful women , while a divorced wife will be free to travel to some romantic location , and both will enjoy a new lease on life .  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
However , Professor Kim was well aware of Hsiao 's romantic temperament and tender nature ; his works have always abounded with vivid color and layer upon layer of beautiful , unforgettable melody .

In charge of general medicine in the assembly hall is a Muslim woman doctor , wearing a beautiful tudong ( Muslim headscarf ) , gently asking each patient where it hurts . Across a lawn from the assembly hall , in a space where the dentist has set up , little children , fearful of having their teeth pulled , eyes filling with tears , seem anxious to escape . The doctor from Singapore , speaking to them in Malaysian , 70-80% of which is similar to Indonesian , stays busy trying to keep them mollified .  
The three major gods have thousands of incarnations . For instance Vishnu can appear as fish , wild boar , dwarf , holy turtle and so forth , and Vishnu 's wife-Durga the " inaccessible " - alike has multiple forms and godly powers : Devi , Parvati , Uma , and Kali are among her beautiful incarnations .  
For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet . The " non-smokestack " tourism industry has not , over the years , received its fair share of attention , but as we enter the 21st century and the economy , science and technology all move steadily onward and upward , the situation is finally changing .  
In 1995 , Chen Chih-yang 's work Peony Beauty won a prize at the Fourth National Handicraft Awards .

Arriving in Jenju , visitors are immediately granted a vision of beautiful , homey farmlands and farm animals . The fields are interspersed with buildings-traditional farmhouses made of plain concrete and tile , and a smattering of elegant European-style structures . Whether rough or refined , each house has its own luxuriant garden , and it is that lush greenery that catches the eye and slows the step of most visitors .  
Attentive visitors can also learn some of the many stories the guesthouses have to tell . For example , the exceptionally stylish Garden of Rushes has a beautiful garden , an elegantly decorated interior , and a marvelously graceful innkeeper who looks as if she had just stepped out of one of Chiung Yao 's romances . But the kicker is that the garden , which features a small bridge over running water , was designed and built by the innkeeper and her husband in their spare time .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
" It 's like a chicken digging for bugs to eat-if there are no bugs in this spot , he 'll head off somewhere else . " Because they did n't want to be sponsored , and thus be constrained by businesspeople , they decided to set up for themselves . They found Sanhsing , where the land was cheap and the area secluded and conducive to creativity , and built a small , beautiful museum , starting along the path to self-sufficient artistry .  
In 1989 , the company 's art editor brought back books of paper sculptures from an overseas trip . At the time , this form of artistic expression was relatively unknown in Taiwan , but Wu Ching-fang found the beautiful paper sculpture works on each page of the book strangely attractive and was especially fascinated by a Japanese book on paper cutting by Noda Ajin . These works clearly differed from Western pieces , tending to be more adult in orientation .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
Writer Li Ang was n't bothered that she was unable to make it to the top this time . She figured this was a perfect foreshadowing of a future trip up the mountain when the azaleas would be in bloom . " I 've traveled all over the world . I never imagined that the most beautiful spot was right here under my feet . "  
There is something dramatic about Wu 's fascination with butterflies : he was born with red-green color blindness , but is besotted with lovely butterflies of every color . Like a deaf musician , Wu arouses a natural curiosity in people who wonder whether the world he sees can really be as beautiful as theirs .  
Architecture has long been a most regrettable , unbecoming shortcoming of the " beautiful island " of Taiwan . Shop signs sticking out all over the place , iron window grates plastered all over buildings , and shacks willy-nilly sprouting on rooftops-an architectural crazy quilt more post-modern than post-modern , in " immigrant makeshift " style . People from overseas have a difficult time describing Taiwan cities as " beautiful . " The best they can manage is " unusual . "  
Scholars of architecture can not bring themselves to write books that appeal to popular taste , while publishers soldier on despite losses , remaining committed to selling what is available . Yet in the uneven balance between the beautiful and the marketplace , some people do produce books that are big sellers . Architectural writer Chen Shih-liang , from his Architecture in Postcard I and Architecture in Postcard II to Hooked on Architectural Travel has produced an excellent model for the marketability of architectural books-and has pioneered a new direction for the genre .  
On the 24th day following birth , it was customary to place a chicken egg , stone , coin , and green onion in a basin of water , which was then used to wash and shave the baby 's head , signifying the hope that the child would have a face as smooth and beautiful as an egg , have a skull as hard as a rock , make lots of money , and be smart .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Then in late April Kenneth Pai , a literary icon in his own right and a tireless promoter of Kun Opera , followed with his own production of The Peony Pavilion , a moving and beautiful spectacle that brought packed houses at the National Theater to their feet for long and rapturous standing ovations .  
Pai first heard Mei Lanfang perform the " Walking in the Garden , Waking from a Dream " episode of The Peony Pavilion in Shanghai when he was ten years old . Though he did n't really understand it , the lines , " Once the violet and vermilion blossoms ran riot round the broken walls and through the ruined wells ; What has happened to the glorious times and beautiful scenes , in whose courtyards are pleasures and entertainments now to be found ? " etched themselves into deep into his brain .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
In recent years , the Taipei City government has seized its takeover of the management of sewers as an opportunity to clean firebreak lanes between buildings that have been illegally occupied .

In one of the main lanes of the village of Wutai in the mountains of Pingtung County , there is beautiful stone-slab pattern in black , the Rukai tribe 's favorite color , on a side wall . Below the wall a small electric box has been painstakingly covered with a wooden ornament .  
Among the various folk art performance groups , " Household Generals " troupes , with their painted faces and awe-inspiring and beautiful movements , appear quite mysterious amid the smoke of exploding strings of firecrackers .

Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
It may have been because she was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery , but Fu Chieh left her knapsack on a mountain top . She only noticed that she 'd lost it when we planned to go the free market . We rushed back to the mountain to look for the knapsack , and came across a good-hearted person who had found it and who returned it to Fu Chieh . This was one of several pleasant surprises during this trip .  
One of those beautiful pages was written when , on the heels of an intensive campaign of work done by all sectors throughout our society , with the support of the international community and led mainly by this Committee , the then United States President , Jimmy Carter , granted an unconditional pardon to our national heroes who were then still jailed in the United States for their action against foreign dominion .

It has developed into the world 's only Buddhist center where the blue Buddhism ( Chinese Buddhism ) and yellow Buddhism ( Lamaism ) coexist on one mountain and deliver sermons together .

The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .

This indicates that once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , Taiwan will not be lucky enough to avoid being hurt .  No matter how firm the US commitment to Taiwan 's defense is and how advanced the weapons systems the US side has promised to sell are , Taiwan is likely to become a piece of meat under the sharp knives of the international big powers .  Should this happen , Taiwan would stop being a beautiful and prosperous island .

The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal .

From the melody one can understand the wisdom of life and the changes of the track . Bodies warming up on the turf are like adagio - - slow but ordered .

Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat .

Steep cliffs and towering rocks backed by a thick emerald carpet of grass , magnificent coral reefs , pristine white sand beaches and blue sky and water combine for beautiful scenery .

There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
With a tone of deep reflection , Mulroney affirms , " Because of him , we 've come to see a beautiful home that we never noticed before , and we 've become aware that it will easily be destroyed if we are n't careful , just like in Nebraska , where tens of thousands of buffalo trod the plains as far as the eye could see , and the native Americans lived by following the buffalo herds that spread out like a sea between the earth and sky .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve .

Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
She says that at the beginning their limbs were stiff and they were rather inhibited and unwilling to express themselves , and were always looking down at the floor .

This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight .

It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
In the early 1980s his book A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction made him a celebrity in Beijing cultural circles , and was known as one of the " four beautiful kites launched into China 's broad , lonely skies .

Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .

Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape .

This happened during a leadership class when O-Young left the trail and fell behind the group in order to photograph some beautiful mountain scenery .

At the same time , his work is quite unique : dreamy soft landscapes like Monet 's with sharp , abstract , eye-catching colors . When he paints people , the beautiful women of his paintings always have clear and bright eyes that are overly large for their faces .

Things in the background of his paintings might be overly large , and things in the foreground overly small . . . .  
The gleaming white Hsiyu Lighthouse , located at the island 's southwestern tip , guides ships as they ply between Xiamen , Penghu , and Taiwan , and fishermen working the seas to the west of Penghu depend on it in their nighttime operations .

The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
" People in society do not understand the costs of divorce , " says Chen . Reading about scandals and breakups among celebrities every day in the media , many people get the erroneous impression that divorce is something fashionable , even an essential part of an interesting and colorful life . They imagine that after divorce a man will be surrounded by beautiful women , while a divorced wife will be free to travel to some romantic location , and both will enjoy a new lease on life .  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
However , Professor Kim was well aware of Hsiao 's romantic temperament and tender nature ; his works have always abounded with vivid color and layer upon layer of beautiful , unforgettable melody .

The doctor from Singapore , speaking to them in Malaysian , 70-80% of which is similar to Indonesian , stays busy trying to keep them mollified .  
The three major gods have thousands of incarnations . For instance Vishnu can appear as fish , wild boar , dwarf , holy turtle and so forth , and Vishnu 's wife-Durga the " inaccessible " - alike has multiple forms and godly powers : Devi , Parvati , Uma , and Kali are among her beautiful incarnations .  
For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet . The " non-smokestack " tourism industry has not , over the years , received its fair share of attention , but as we enter the 21st century and the economy , science and technology all move steadily onward and upward , the situation is finally changing .  
In 1995 , Chen Chih-yang 's work Peony Beauty won a prize at the Fourth National Handicraft Awards .

Arriving in Jenju , visitors are immediately granted a vision of beautiful , homey farmlands and farm animals . The fields are interspersed with buildings-traditional farmhouses made of plain concrete and tile , and a smattering of elegant European-style structures . Whether rough or refined , each house has its own luxuriant garden , and it is that lush greenery that catches the eye and slows the step of most visitors .  
Attentive visitors can also learn some of the many stories the guesthouses have to tell . For example , the exceptionally stylish Garden of Rushes has a beautiful garden , an elegantly decorated interior , and a marvelously graceful innkeeper who looks as if she had just stepped out of one of Chiung Yao 's romances . But the kicker is that the garden , which features a small bridge over running water , was designed and built by the innkeeper and her husband in their spare time .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
" It 's like a chicken digging for bugs to eat-if there are no bugs in this spot , he 'll head off somewhere else . " Because they did n't want to be sponsored , and thus be constrained by businesspeople , they decided to set up for themselves . They found Sanhsing , where the land was cheap and the area secluded and conducive to creativity , and built a small , beautiful museum , starting along the path to self-sufficient artistry .  
In 1989 , the company 's art editor brought back books of paper sculptures from an overseas trip . At the time , this form of artistic expression was relatively unknown in Taiwan , but Wu Ching-fang found the beautiful paper sculpture works on each page of the book strangely attractive and was especially fascinated by a Japanese book on paper cutting by Noda Ajin . These works clearly differed from Western pieces , tending to be more adult in orientation .  
With its beautiful natural scenery , Ilan County has a strong environmental consciousness . As early as 1977 , the county began experimenting with and promoting the recycling of kitchen waste . Natural Environmental Protection Foundation chairperson Liu Shu-hui and National Ilan Institute of Technology jointly developed a simple composting method suitable for use by families and neighborhoods .  
Writer Li Ang was n't bothered that she was unable to make it to the top this time . She figured this was a perfect foreshadowing of a future trip up the mountain when the azaleas would be in bloom .

There is something dramatic about Wu 's fascination with butterflies : he was born with red-green color blindness , but is besotted with lovely butterflies of every color . Like a deaf musician , Wu arouses a natural curiosity in people who wonder whether the world he sees can really be as beautiful as theirs .  
Architecture has long been a most regrettable , unbecoming shortcoming of the " beautiful island " of Taiwan . Shop signs sticking out all over the place , iron window grates plastered all over buildings , and shacks willy-nilly sprouting on rooftops-an architectural crazy quilt more post-modern than post-modern , in " immigrant makeshift " style . People from overseas have a difficult time describing Taiwan cities as " beautiful . " The best they can manage is " unusual . "  
Scholars of architecture can not bring themselves to write books that appeal to popular taste , while publishers soldier on despite losses , remaining committed to selling what is available . Yet in the uneven balance between the beautiful and the marketplace , some people do produce books that are big sellers . Architectural writer Chen Shih-liang , from his Architecture in Postcard I and Architecture in Postcard II to Hooked on Architectural Travel has produced an excellent model for the marketability of architectural books-and has pioneered a new direction for the genre .  
On the 24th day following birth , it was customary to place a chicken egg , stone , coin , and green onion in a basin of water , which was then used to wash and shave the baby 's head , signifying the hope that the child would have a face as smooth and beautiful as an egg , have a skull as hard as a rock , make lots of money , and be smart .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Then in late April Kenneth Pai , a literary icon in his own right and a tireless promoter of Kun Opera , followed with his own production of The Peony Pavilion , a moving and beautiful spectacle that brought packed houses at the National Theater to their feet for long and rapturous standing ovations .  
Pai first heard Mei Lanfang perform the " Walking in the Garden , Waking from a Dream " episode of The Peony Pavilion in Shanghai when he was ten years old . Though he did n't really understand it , the lines , " Once the violet and vermilion blossoms ran riot round the broken walls and through the ruined wells ; What has happened to the glorious times and beautiful scenes , in whose courtyards are pleasures and entertainments now to be found ? " etched themselves into deep into his brain .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
In recent years , the Taipei City government has seized its takeover of the management of sewers as an opportunity to clean firebreak lanes between buildings that have been illegally occupied . The city has set up wooden frames for vine plants , planted flowering plants , and placed mosaics to turn back alleys into beautiful rear gardens .  
In one of the main lanes of the village of Wutai in the mountains of Pingtung County , there is beautiful stone-slab pattern in black , the Rukai tribe 's favorite color , on a side wall . Below the wall a small electric box has been painstakingly covered with a wooden ornament .  
Among the various folk art performance groups , " Household Generals " troupes , with their painted faces and awe-inspiring and beautiful movements , appear quite mysterious amid the smoke of exploding strings of firecrackers . Holding terrifying tools of torture , they strike fear deep into people 's hearts . And the performers in these troupes-seemingly half god and half man-send their audiences back and forth between realms celestial and earthly .  
Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
It may have been because she was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery , but Fu Chieh left her knapsack on a mountain top . She only noticed that she 'd lost it when we planned to go the free market . We rushed back to the mountain to look for the knapsack , and came across a good-hearted person who had found it and who returned it to Fu Chieh . This was one of several pleasant surprises during this trip .  
One of those beautiful pages was written when , on the heels of an intensive campaign of work done by all sectors throughout our society , with the support of the international community and led mainly by this Committee , the then United States President , Jimmy Carter , granted an unconditional pardon to our national heroes who were then still jailed in the United States for their action against foreign dominion .  
This choice constitutes clear recognition of his exceptional personal qualities and his wealth of experience as a seasoned diplomat , and it is a collective tribute to his beautiful country , Malaysia , whose dynamism and outstanding economic success over the past few years I salute .  
The international community is fully entitled to become impatient and even forgive the word exasperated , for it has devoted much of its energy and means to try to help this beautiful and potentially prosperous country , which has been torn by so much war and suffering .  
The magnificent landscapes with picturesque mountain ranges , the ancient and beautiful cultural monuments , the fine ski resorts and the Black Sea coast with its subtropical climate are capable of attracting tourists from all parts of the world .
