While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .

The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .
