What is more serious is that the funds had been raised at the expense of the bank 's legitimate status and reputation among the enterprises and the public in the society .

Zeng Peiyan said : We must control population growth , protect and develop the ecological environment , and save and effectively utilize resources to truly base economic and social development on constant scientific and technological advancement , the sustained utilization of resources , an ecological balance , and a clean environment .  
And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .

Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .

In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
In the economic field , we are faced with two major topics that should be solved properly .  One is to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the other is to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Under the dual impact of the two tidal waves of world economic globalization and regional blocs formation , Taiwan 's hope of sustained , stable economic development lies in the mainland of the motherland , without which Taiwan 's economic development would certainly be faced with a predicament .  A Taiwan economy that is separated from the mainland of the motherland will have no way out and will sink and emerge alternately and struggle to survive in the flood tide of world economic globalization .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
The more distinct and stronger the main theme is , the more unified our thinking will be , the more closely our forces will be rallied , the more united our people will become , the more stable our society will be , the more smoothly our reforms will advance , and the greater guarantee we will provide for the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy .  
Since the 1960s and 1970s , many countries and regions of Asia have taken a practical approach , implementing development strategies of catching up and surpassing , rising quickly from the post-war ruins , achieving sustained and rapid economic growth , greatly improving the standard of living of the people , and writing a new chapter in the promotion of world economic development .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .

In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .  The increased pace of the change of functions provided the beneficial conditions .

Moreover , a noticeable increase in the numbers of new members of the work force and unemployed personnel directly seeking job in the labor market will bring considerable pressure on Chinese cities and country in employment this year .

Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
The implementation of the proactive financial policy not only has effectively controlled the total supply and demand in the immediate economy but also greatly pushed forward the adjustment of economic structure .  It has alleviated the " bottleneck " restraint of economic development , thus accumulating reserve strength for sustained and stable economic growth .  
The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
Jiang Zemin said : " Uruguay is beautiful and fertile .  It has long-term political stability and sustained economic development .  The people 's living standard has continued to rise and the country has played a positive role in international affairs .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .

In the face of China 's enormous economic body , abundant resources , large labor force , and vast market , of course we can not ignore China 's competitive potential if its economic reform develops in a sustained and smooth manner .

Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .

With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .

Fostering an enabling environment for development implies a concerted effort by Governments at the national and international levels , in collaboration with other actors in development , to ensure that the interplay among those policies , measures and institutions and the sum total of their impact promotes not only sustained economic growth but a development style that is sustainable and broad-based and whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .

For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .

Bringing about such reforms poses a formidable challenge in and of itself , but the policy makers task is even more complex since considerable political and social challenges will need to be addressed while waiting for the reforms to yield benefits in terms of rising incomes and sustained growth .  
This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .

The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
Here , too , it is apparent that without a more favourable international environment , without significant financial input , without real alleviation , if not outright cancellation , of the debt and without a sustained and lasting rate of growth , the laudable and courageous efforts and the sacrifices made so far by the African countries will prove insufficient , if not useless , in the face of the great needs of the African peoples .  
A sustained and determined effort is necessary if the national peace agreements are to be fully implemented , particularly as concerns the fostering and protection of human rights , equal opportunities and judicial , fiscal and agrarian reform .

SADC was firmly resolved to reduce poverty through sustained and broadbased economic growth and equitable distribution of social services , but the enormous burden of external debt inhibited the full economic and social development of the region . 
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
This requires sustained educational and proactive initiatives in those various sectors at the community level which are geared towards promoting harmonious social relations between different ethnic groups .  
The ongoing war has contributed to continuing human rights violations , sustained interference by foreign Powers and farreaching environmental damage , not to mention the staggering social cost of the long civil war .  
There is a need to secure from legislative bodies sustained support for coordination efforts by providing to them a more transparent account of resources involved by , and expected outputs derived from , an enhanced coordination in the system .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .

Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,

A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .

Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ;  
Secondly , while in the past the focus of country-level communication interventions was on the advocacy and social mobilization strategic components , in recent years there has been increasing understanding of the fact that programme communication the communication strategy specifically aimed at reaching families , communities and individuals , to facilitate informed behavioural change is a necessary strategic component and needs to be utilized in synergy with the other two , if sustained societal change is to be achieved .

We hold that , as to the current operating state of the Chinese national economy , there is no need to over-debate the meaning of deflation , because these three versions have a common economic focus , or that China 's overall prices have been in a sustained falling trend for over two years since October 1997 .  
What is more serious is that the funds had been raised at the expense of the bank 's legitimate status and reputation among the enterprises and the public in the society .  As the Beijiao Office of People 's Construction Bank of China , which should also be held responsible for the case , also sustained heavy losses , the state-owned commercial banks have naturally seen their reputation compromised to a serious extent .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .

China 's economy has maintained a favorable momentum of sustained , rapid and sound development , ranking the seventh in the world in terms of economic aggregates .  Its overall national strength has increased markedly and the texture of life of its people improved notably .

Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
In the economic field , we are faced with two major topics that should be solved properly .  One is to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the other is to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Under the dual impact of the two tidal waves of world economic globalization and regional blocs formation , Taiwan 's hope of sustained , stable economic development lies in the mainland of the motherland , without which Taiwan 's economic development would certainly be faced with a predicament .  A Taiwan economy that is separated from the mainland of the motherland will have no way out and will sink and emerge alternately and struggle to survive in the flood tide of world economic globalization .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
The more distinct and stronger the main theme is , the more unified our thinking will be , the more closely our forces will be rallied , the more united our people will become , the more stable our society will be , the more smoothly our reforms will advance , and the greater guarantee we will provide for the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy .

The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
First , inflation was successfully restrained , and " soft landing " of the economy was smoothly implemented ; then , the tendency of deflation was effectively checked , and a major turning point was brought about in economic growth .

Under the " Ninth Five-year Plan " in particular , despite the complicated domestic and international situations , China 's national economy still sustained rapid and healthy development ; the GDP grew at an average rate of 8 percent a year , and it is estimated that the year 2000 ' s GDP will top more than 8.7-trillion yuan , or more than $ 1-trillion at today 's exchange rate .

In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .

Moreover , a noticeable increase in the numbers of new members of the work force and unemployed personnel directly seeking job in the labor market will bring considerable pressure on Chinese cities and country in employment this year .

Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
The implementation of the proactive financial policy not only has effectively controlled the total supply and demand in the immediate economy but also greatly pushed forward the adjustment of economic structure .

The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
Jiang Zemin said : " Uruguay is beautiful and fertile .  It has long-term political stability and sustained economic development .  The people 's living standard has continued to rise and the country has played a positive role in international affairs .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .

In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
But most relevant to the theme of this most important international day of solidarity was the understanding expressed in the article that the rapid and sustained economic development we have experienced in Antigua and Barbuda is not a legacy of colonialism .  
Many lack the capacity to articulate a long-term vision , an integrated policy framework and coherent programming or lack the capacity for policy reconciliation between sustained economic growth and sustainable development or between structural adjustment and social stability .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
Fostering an enabling environment for development implies a concerted effort by Governments at the national and international levels , in collaboration with other actors in development , to ensure that the interplay among those policies , measures and institutions and the sum total of their impact promotes not only sustained economic growth but a development style that is sustainable and broad-based and whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
One of the main objectives that the Transitional Government is committed to achieving , as was made public in a statement on 25 July 1996 , is to set up a strong basis for lasting peace through the implementation of a peace process sustained by dialogue and for which the ultimate goal is to build up national institutions by consensus .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
To tackle illicit cultivation in Afghanistan effectively and to sever trafficking routes flowing from that country will require a major - and sustained - investment by the international community coupled with the commitment of local authorities to enforce a ban on opium poppy cultivation as a condition of participation in alternative development activities .

It identified what changes in the justice system are necessary or desirable to achieve closer interdisciplinary teamwork and a better impact , in particular , maximum sustained functional recovery and minimum criminal recidivism among drug-abusing offenders .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
In supporting those processes , whether at the country level through the resident coordinator system , or at the regional or global levels , UNFPA sought to be constructive in raising issues so that meaningful and sustained progress could be made .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
Reaffirming that the full implementation of the Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and , to that end , recognizing that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ,  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
South / South cooperation , including TCDC and ECDC , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their more effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system .

The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
The discussion focused on six main subjects : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiatives ; and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
Later , programme targets were declared by the IDNDR Scientific and Technical Committee to encourage all countries to conduct a national hazard risk assessment ; incorporate a sustained disaster mitigation strategy into the national economic development plan ; and ensure improved access to effective early warning practices at all levels of responsibility .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
Bringing about such reforms poses a formidable challenge in and of itself , but the policy makers task is even more complex since considerable political and social challenges will need to be addressed while waiting for the reforms to yield benefits in terms of rising incomes and sustained growth .  
This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .  
The central theme of this review that population concerns are an indispensable part of national and international efforts to achieve equitable , sustained development is particularly relevant to small island developing States , such as Jamaica and many in the Caribbean .  
From this point of view , we believe it imperative for the international community to facilitate the promotion of a supportive economic environment , particularly for developing countries in their effort to eradicate poverty and achieve sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , as agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development .  
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
The overall strategy is based on using limited UNDP core resources to launch capacity-building programmes that are subsequently sustained through bilateral donor support , and ensuring the sustainability of capacity-building programmes by matching UNDP technical and managerial expertise with the accountability and viability of local implementation partners .  
It recognizes that sustained action is required to promote rapid development of developing countries , and then declares : as a complement to the efforts of developing countries , effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
A country improves its chances of success in the struggle to reduce poverty when it achieves strong , sustained economic growth which creates a substantial expansion in the number of high-productivity jobs ; when the incomes such growth generates are also helped by a policy aimed at defending their purchasing power through low inflation ; and when support also exists in the form of significant programmes of well focused public transfers .  
The discussion focused on six main issues : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiative and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
The report of the second panel concerning the current humanitarian situation in Iraq ( S / 1999 / 356 , annex II ) , had referred to the qualitative dimension of the impact of the sanctions and to the cumulative effects of sustained deprivation on the psychosocial cohesion of the Iraqi population as indicated by an increase in juvenile delinquency , begging and prostitution , anxiety about the future and lack of motivation , and a rising sense of isolation .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly the countries of origin and destination , to further strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;

Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
The worsening of the debt situation of middle-income and some lower-middle-income countries was due not only to the incapacity to pay debt obligations owing to temporary shortfalls in revenues but also to the more structural problem of raising sufficient revenue , particularly hard currency , in the long term to service their debts , while preserving their sustained economic growth and development .  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Recognizing that , while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty through the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with a long-term perspective ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Australia and Canada , said that the central message of the Cairo Conference reinforced at the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly was that population issues were development issues and that the Cairo agenda should be considered as part of a global framework for sustained and sustainable development . 
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,

Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
In accordance with the rules governing international responsibility , we affirm the legally established right of the Republic of Iraq to seek compensation for all the losses , in terms of human , material and moral damage , that have been sustained by Iraq and its people owing to acts of aggression that are contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,  
We are hopeful that the effective implementation of this decision will go a long way in supporting national efforts to reduce the debt burden of these countries to more serviceable levels and open for them the opportunities for real and sustained economic growth .  
Coupled with the adverse effects of widespread and pervasive poverty , the phenomenon of ageing will have far-reaching implications for the efforts of developing countries to achieve the sustained economic growth and social development which are fundamental for ensuring a better quality of life for the entire population .  
Subsequently , at meetings held in Bolivia , Paraguay and Panama , the heads of State and Government of the Rio Group reaffirmed regional determination to combat and overcome poverty , as well as their conviction that a sustained process of economic and social development is the only guarantee of improving peoples quality of life and of democratic stability in Latin America . 
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
Here , too , it is apparent that without a more favourable international environment , without significant financial input , without real alleviation , if not outright cancellation , of the debt and without a sustained and lasting rate of growth , the laudable and courageous efforts and the sacrifices made so far by the African countries will prove insufficient , if not useless , in the face of the great needs of the African peoples .  
A sustained and determined effort is necessary if the national peace agreements are to be fully implemented , particularly as concerns the fostering and protection of human rights , equal opportunities and judicial , fiscal and agrarian reform .  
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Our purpose is to improve the quality of life of average and low income earners and to encourage equitable distribution of goods and services in the economic and social sector without excluding the customary and traditional values observed by communities , and to integrate programmes and activities in a manageable manner to ensure that strong community participation , commitment and ownership in various development areas can and will continue to be sustained .  
In 1994 , at the historic International Conference on Population and Development the largest intergovernmental conference on population and development ever held we pledged our collective efforts to addressing the critical challenges and interrelationships between population and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
As the Panel has previously concluded , a ] where the loss can not be related to one of the acts or circumstances identified in paragraph 21 of decision 7 , a special showing is required to demonstrate that the loss sustained was a direct consequence of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . a ] The Panel therefore first considers which geographical areas involved in the claims under review were affected by the circumstances or events , set out in paragraph 21 ( a ) . 
The systematic , widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq , resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad _ based discrimination and widespread terror ;

Recognizing that while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty by the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with long-term perspectives ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
Both countries sustained heavy losses of human life and much of their infrastructure and productive economic base have been destroyed , casting more doubts upon the future prospects of these countries to address structural poverty and underdevelopment .  
SADC was firmly resolved to reduce poverty through sustained and broadbased economic growth and equitable distribution of social services , but the enormous burden of external debt inhibited the full economic and social development of the region . 
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
This requires sustained educational and proactive initiatives in those various sectors at the community level which are geared towards promoting harmonious social relations between different ethnic groups .  
The ongoing war has contributed to continuing human rights violations , sustained interference by foreign Powers and farreaching environmental damage , not to mention the staggering social cost of the long civil war .  
There is a need to secure from legislative bodies sustained support for coordination efforts by providing to them a more transparent account of resources involved by , and expected outputs derived from , an enhanced coordination in the system .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .
