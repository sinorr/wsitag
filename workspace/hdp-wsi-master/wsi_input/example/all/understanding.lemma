For two decades , the joint commission has played an important role in increasing the mutual understanding of the two countries , promoting the mutually beneficial bilateral economic and trade cooperation , and maintaining and facilitating the stable and healthy development of the bilateral economic and trade relations .  
Over many years , the CPPCC has maintained multi-level , friendly exchange and cooperation with Thailand 's Senate and has become an important part of the bilateral relations .  It has made its contribution in increasing mutual understanding and trust and promoting the stable and healthy development of the relations between the two countries .  
Today , the Henan provincial government and more than 100 representatives from 88 foreign investment financial institutions stationed in Beijing held an economic cooperation negotiation conference here to promote mutual understanding between Henan Province and international finance circles , and to open financing channels for Henan 's economic development .  
He pointed out that in the United Nations affairs , China has been consistently abiding by the goals and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter , seriously fulfilling its responsibilities , actively supporting various kinds of United Nations work done in the spirit of the Charter , and has made constructive efforts and positive contributions to maintaining world peace , seeking the just and reasonable resolution of major international and regional issues , protecting the interests of developing countries , and the promotion of equal co-operation and understanding among various countries .  
We should extensively engage in cooperation and exchanges with other countries , fully capitalize on the favorable conditions stemming from our contacts with relevant organizations in foreign countries and our understanding of the latest developments abroad , and take the initiative in helping enterprises improve their production techniques , technological standards , and product quality .  
Yu Yongbo pointed out : Unremittingly attaching importance to the weapon of theory and enabling officers and soldiers of the whole army to have a deep understanding in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought , especially Deng Xiaoping Theory , are the fundamental task and basic project in improving ideological and political work of various military units in the new period .  
The book on the " expositions of Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin on Ideological and Political Work " should be regarded as the basic teaching materials , fitted into the theoretical study for party committees at and above the regimental level and into the political education for the PLA units , and included in the political theoretical classes and study of colleges and universities .  The people should be organized to conscientiously study it .  Leading cadres , especially political cadres , should take the lead in studying and understanding these expositions well .  
Five years ago , President Jiang Zemin laid out an eight-point proposal for the current development of cross-strait relations , acting in line with the basic interests of the Chinese nation , and showing full consideration and understanding for the interests and sentiments of the Taiwan people .  It took the high ground , being wise and foresighted , to be jointly supported and responded to by Chinese people both in China and abroad , including the Taiwan people .  
Some local authorities and departments and administrators do not have sufficient understanding of the danger of pirated audio-visual products .  They pay a lot more attention to wiping out pornographic publications than to cracking down on pirated goods .  Some local authorities are tolerant of pirated goods , thinking that they are harmless goods that the masses need and that keep pace with economic development .  
During the process of comprehensive pushing forward this great cause , only when people 's ideology reaches a desired high level can they cast off the shackles of outmoded concepts and an ossified way of thinking ; and gain a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of reform , development , and stability , so that they can display creativity and open up a new prospect in their work .  
At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
Philosophy is an advanced form of theoretical thinking ; and is a fundamental stand , viewpoint , and method used by people for observing , understanding , and guiding both practice and scientific research .  
On 1 March , the Central Propaganda Department called a departmental affairs meeting to further study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , enhance understanding , seek unity of thinking , make thoroughgoing reflections in the light of the realities , work out concrete arrangements for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in its implementation of the directives of the central authorities , and to discuss a number of major issues which need to be resolved in the propaganda and ideological work during the country 's present cross-century development .  
The central leading comrades have come to the grassroots units , directly heard grassroots cadres ' briefings and pertinently pointed out problems .  This fact fully shows their understanding , trust and loving care of grassroots cadres , shows the high degree of importance attached by the Party Central Committee to the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level , shows their firm conviction in Marxism and the strategic vision of them as party and state leaders , and shows the correctness of the policy decision made by the Party Central Committee .  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province has opened special columns , published serial reports , and initiated a large-scale discussion in the press , with a view to guiding the vast numbers of cadres and masses to gain a correct understanding of the new changes that have taken place in China 's economic development conditions today , further emancipate their mind and renew their concepts , and to think and act in line with the criterion of " three beneficial 's . "  
A correct evaluation of the nature of growth in the economic returns of Liaoning ï¿½s state-owned industries will have a direct bearing on the choice of policy decisions for the next step of the reform of SOEs in Liaoning and even the whole nation .  The policy-making level in Liaoning Province has a sober understanding of this issue .  
Meanwhile , they are also conducive to enhancing understanding , expanding common understanding , turning the party and government policies and principles into the majority of people 's conscious action , discovering and pooling the wisdom and experience of the masses , relying on the people to tide over difficulties and resolve problems , harmonizing the relationship in distribution of interests , eliminating social contradictions , and safeguarding and developing the political situation featured by unity and stability .  
Guangdong , which is in the forefront of reform and opening up , must all the more enhance understanding of the importance of " grasping things with two hands , with both hands firm , " tangibly strengthen ideological and political work , and launch an extensive and thorough education drive to " think of the source when getting rich , and advance in thinking when getting rich . "  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
A few of them do not even want to become close to or understand the lives of the rank and file .  Some of our military 's literary and artistic workers do go into the lives of rank and file , but they mostly gain just a superficial understanding through cursory observation .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
Localities may hold report meetings as they see fit on major issues of major concern to the masses like the state 's economic development , the great development of China 's western regions , the reform of state-owned enterprises and the efforts to help them shed difficulties , and the accession to the WTO , which will help the broad mass of cadres and the masses understand the situation at home and abroad and enable them to deepen understanding of the party 's and the state 's policies .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
In the past half a century and more , Comrade Chen Yun 's philosophical thinking has helped resolved many major party and state affairs .  This has not only won my respect and admiration , but it has also made me realize deeply that at that time I was able to understand only its " application " aspect and did not approach it from the level of world outlook and methodology .  My understanding of it was very superficial .  
The leaders of the two countries have reached consensus on the 16-character principle of " maintaining long-term stability , gearing to the needs of the future , maintaining good neighborly and friendly relations , and engaging in an all-round cooperation , " and have defined a framework for the future growth of relations between our two countries in the new century .  This has served to enhance mutual understanding and enrich the content of relations between our two parties and two countries .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "  
Non-governmental economic cooperation has evolved from individual corporate ones to the stage of establishing " special economic zones " and industrial parks .  Increasing economic and trade cooperation and personnel exchanges have helped increase mutual understanding and trust , which not only bring real benefits for the people of the two Koreas but produce a positive impact on the improvement of the north-south relationship .  
Whether it is in terms of blood relationship and geographical ties , or tradition or culture , the two sides of the strait are an inseparable entity , which has been universally recognized by the international community and a common understanding of all the Chinese descendants at home and abroad .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his belief that his current visit would help further strengthen the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Israeli peoples and promote the comprehensive development of the existing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan held talks here today with Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa , Minister of External Relations of Mongolia . The two sides exchanged views in a cordial and friendly atmosphere on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern , and reached a common understanding over a wide range of issues .  
There must be an accurate understanding of the actual income levels of those eligible for support , and the procedures for the application , evaluation , and issuance of money must be standardized .  It must be done in an open , fair , and impartial manner , with strict reviews , notices posted openly , and the monitoring of what is received .  
In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .  
On the other hand , some districts and counties in Tianjin Municipality also held meetings of their party committee standing committees to study and implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speeches in connection with the actual conditions .  The social scientists and theorists in Tianjin also held a symposium .  More than 20 experts and scholars attended the meeting and expressed their feelings after studying and understanding the profound connotation of the " three represents " concept .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
However , since the goals were not clear and the standards were not clear , the understanding of " computerization and informationization " led to an emphasis on hardware , while taking software lightly ; an emphasis on single units , while taking networking lightly ; and an emphasis on development and redundant construction projects .  Shortcomings occurred where systems construction was not complete ; technical systems were not compatible ; and non unified standards increased daily .  
Through ideological and political work , we will enhance people 's ideological consciousness , promote good public conduct in society , solve various problems in people 's minds , facilitate communication and mutual understanding among the people , and thus coordinate interpersonal relations , mitigate various social contradictions , and maintain a stable and orderly condition in society while keeping all the vigor and dynamism .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
People generally believe that such a pragmatic approach and a win-win principle employed by both the North and the South will usher in a new dynamic period for exchanges as well as economic and trade cooperation , and lay a solid foundation for enhancing mutual understanding and trust , putting an end to confrontation , and seeking peaceful coexistence and prosperity between the two sides .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Recently , this reporter went to a place in Hebei for assignment .  Arriving at the office of the county government , this reporter explained the intent of investigating and understanding some conditions reported by farmers .  The director of the county government office who received this reporter let out a long heavy sigh and said : " In recent years , our organizations at the grass-roots level have been weak .  The cadres dare not speak or take any actions .  The farmers are spoiled as a result . "  
Guided by the central departments concerned , the Hong Kong Garrison persistently regarded studying or understanding the law as a basic project ; intensified both legal education and behavioral guidance ; and enabled both the articles and spirit of the Hong Kong Garrison Law to take root in the hearts of all the officers and men and become a conscious sense among them as well .  
The garrison has introduced an external spokesman system and has regularly held Open Day at its barracks with an eye on enhancing understanding or communication between itself and the Hong Kong public .  Practice has shown that the garrison has established fine , harmonious , and mutual-trust army-government relations with the SAR government and has forcefully safeguarded a high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong SAR in such a special environment as " One Country , Two Systems " .  
An absolute majority of the social organizations or people in Hong Kong have supported or cherished the garrison in a variety of ways ; have agreed that the Hong Kong Garrison is entitled in accordance with the law to all rights , interests , or exemptions as demanded by its duties ; and have shown full understanding for the training , exercises , or other military activities held by the garrison in line with its defense duties .  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
To study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we must get an ever clearer understanding of the requirements of the new situation for ideological and political work , enhance our sense of suffering , not lose sight of the importance of ideological and political work , foster the sense of urgency in doing a good job of the work , see of the protracted nature , complexity , and arduousness of the work , and make adequate mental preparations to carry out the work in the long term .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Frequent visits by leaders of the two parliaments and their special committees in recent years , as well as the extensive exchanges in legislation , parliamentary cooperation , bilateral ties , and international issues of common concern during these visits , have enhanced mutual understanding and trust .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
Currently we should put our efforts into in-depth understanding of the specific meaning of preparations for the military struggle in the new period , clarifying the possible specific operational tasks and operational modes we might carry out , and completing training and training the troops to elite status .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .  Exaggerating differences and inciting antagonism can only deceive the people for some time and can not deceive them forever .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China . The US media have the habit of exposing the negative aspects of China , not reporting or reporting less on the positive ones , because the United States still has the arrogant complex of being a big country .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
When one lacks a skeptical critical spirit and reveres all existing understanding as the absolute , the road to scientific progress , passing , breaking new ground , and innovation would be blocked .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
With history as a guide and the future as his orientation , he worked hard to reach a consensus with both the Japanese government and Japanese outside the government on deepening the partnership of friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  As a result , mutual understanding was deepened , the political foundation of bilateral relations was reinforced , and the development of friendly cooperation in all fields was given a boost .  At the same time , there remain in Japan the soil and climate for the growth of militarism .  
Fourth , the mutual visits and reunion of separated families of both sides and the fluttering of " flags of both sides on the Korean peninsula " during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games increased understanding between the north and the south , and expressed their wishes of realizing peaceful reunification through self-reliance .  
All these have enhanced mutual understanding and trust between China and its neighboring countries , strengthened good neighborly relations and cooperation , and contributed to realizing a stable peripheral environment .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
Under the impetus of economic globalization , humanity has expanded its interaction , its contacts , and its understanding , and increased friendship , cooperation , and support .  Various converging and intermingling cultural torrents have smashed the " iron curtain " between countries with different social systems and ideologies , marking a new era in the ways countries compete and test their strength against one another .  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
During his US visit , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian has stepped up dialogues and exchanges , sought common grounds while reserving or narrowing differences , increased common understanding , expanded cooperation , and implemented the important consensus reached between the two heads of state on jointly promoting bilateral relations .  
The two sides conducted extensive , constructive , and frank and sincere dialogue ; increased mutual understanding ; and expressed the wish to make a concerted effort to push forward Sino-US relations . "  
An editorial in Hong Kong 's Ta Kung Pao expressed the belief that during his visit to the United States , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian Qichen has strengthened dialogue and communication ; sought common ground while reserving or narrowing differences ; enhanced common understanding ;  
Here , however , we must warn the Taiwan authorities who show no understanding of the times that for the leader of the Taiwan authorities to be bent on planting the " independence " banner heedless of the desires of the people , and also to invite a gang of " friends of independence " from overseas is just like a blind man riding a blind horse approaching a deep pool at midnight , adding new danger on top of danger .  
Yang Jiechi , Chinese ambassador to the United States , chaired this evening 's function .  In his address , he said : Vice premier Qian 's visit to the United States has fulfilled the objectives of strengthening contact , improving understanding , expanding common consent , and developing cooperation .  It has given a powerful impetus to the development of Sino-US relations toward a sound and stable course .  
Qian Qichen said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin and President Bush exchanged letters and reached an important understanding on the development of Sino-US relations .  This demonstrates the strategic vision of the leaders and reflects the wishes of common citizens .  It points out a way forward for the effort to carry on from the past and forge ahead into the future in Sino-US relations .  
During the visit , the two sides conducted extensive , constructive , and frank and sincere dialogue ; increased mutual understanding ; and expressed the wish to make a concerted effort to push forward Sino-US relations .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Brazilian Ambassador Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said that Brazil and China are two important developing countries , adding that the two countries have had good ties of political cooperation and take an identical or similar stand on major international affairs .  He said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries would further cement bilateral relations and deepen mutual understanding and consensus between the two peoples .  
We are ready to make common efforts with Australia to increase mutual understanding and trust , promote friendship and cooperation , and push forward the continued steady and healthy development of bilateral military relations in the new situation .  
PRC vice premier Qian Qichen 's trip to the United States may have resulted in some mutual strategic understanding , and yielded some preliminary benefits , but at the same time , with the defection of PLA colonel Xu Junping and the blatant spy cases involving scholars traveling to the US , relations between the US and China have not been able to emerge from the shadows , and just now the possibility for worsening and more tense relations exists .  
Zhang Wannian 's current visit is carrying on the past traditions and opening a way for the future , which is aimed at increasing mutual understanding and trust , promoting friendly cooperation , and impelling the steady and healthy development of relations between the two countries and armies .  
On the one hand , we make constant efforts to perfect human rights in China , and on the other hand , we continue to engage in dialogue with foreign friends .  Only when dialogue proceeds from a level playing field , can we advance mutual understanding and promote mutual exchange and cooperation .  
The meeting stressed : To rectify and regulate the market economic order , the key is that we must reach a common understanding .  All localities and departments must attach great importance to and conscientiously bring into effect all the demands made by the State Council . First , we must have stronger leadership , division of labor in a responsible way , close cooperation , and concerted efforts .  
In actuality , during the 1980s , given the pressure of strong public opinion assigning blame for the history books , the Japanese Government was obligated to set a neighboring countries clause in terms of its textbooks , promising these countries that the textbook question would begin from the point of view of obtaining international understanding and international cooperation , and would be given the necessary review and reflection .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
Some British intelligence experts believe that due to such an " unexpected windfall , " the Chinese Communists ' electronic experts will be able to learn about the US forces ' reconnaissance system , counter-reconnaissance system , confrontation system , as well as other relevant technologies in a more comprehensive and in-depth way , or at least be able to broaden their mind or accumulate advance understanding about some weapons after studying the most advanced reconnaissance equipment in modern times .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
Over the past 20-odd years , ever since it was established , CITIC has witnessed relatively smooth development as it has benefited from a correct understanding or judgment of the global economic situation , and this is the key reason , and is inseparable from the work of the CITIC Consultation Committee .  
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze held talks with visiting Chinese State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing in Tbilisi on the afternoon of 13 April . Both sides exchanges views , in a thoroughgoing way , on political relations between China and Georgia , the exchange and cooperation in various fields of endeavor , and international local issues of common interest , and reached a broad consensus of understanding .  
A Communist China official confirmed that since 18 March last year , Chang Yung-fa , who is an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian , had been unable to visit the mainland due to political reason .  However , after " understanding " Chang Yung-fa has " once again " reiterated his stance of supporting the three direct links with the mainland , the Communist China 's leader approved Chang 's business trip to the mainland .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
President Jiang pointed out : China is willing to work together with various Latin American countries in pressing ahead with the establishment and development of long-term , stable , and all-round relations of cooperation between China and Latin America on the basis of equality and mutual benefit .  He also put forth four principles , namely , enhancing mutual understanding , treating each other as equals , and being trusted friends to each other ; strengthening consultations with each other , supporting each other , and safeguarding each other 's legitimate rights or interests in the world ;  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
The meeting required that party committees and organization departments at all levels should further unify thinking , enhance understanding , improve the style of work , effectively guarantee the fulfillment of the assignments , seize the opportune moment when local leading bodes at various levels will be changed , and raise the work of selecting , promoting , and training young cadres to a new level .  
It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
Governments and departments concerned nationwide must unify their understanding , strictly enforce orders and prohibitions , and make concerted efforts to resolutely break down the " fences " of regional blockades and establish and perfect a nationally unified great market of fair competition and regulated order .  
To properly accomplish the economic rural restructuring in our country , we must clearly understand and master the regularity in the evolution of agricultural and the rural economic structure , and then seize the key points based on such understanding , thus making advances in an orderly way .  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
In conducting education and training of middle-aged and young cadres , we must pay close attention mainly to two things : One is that we must help them master the basic tenets of Marxism , get a clear understanding of the objective laws governing the development of human society , and buttress confidence in taking the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics , and guide them to emancipate the mind , use their brains , conduct new explorations in the light of new realities , and promote innovations and development in Marxist theory .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Premier Zhu Rongji 's visit increased mutual understanding between China and the five countries , promoted bilateral economic and trade cooperation , consolidated and strengthened existing traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations , and expanded China 's influence .  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that Asia and Europe have different ideologies and policies , but the two sides have steadily enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and increased cooperation through equal and frank dialog and consultation at a high level on a regular basis . 
Organizing party and government organizations to help poor people at fixed points is of great significance to cadres ' understanding the national situation , the grassroots level and the people , to raising the cadres ability to solve actual problems , to maintaining close ties between the party and the people and to improving the work style of various offices .  
Nevertheless , following the gradual deepening of their understanding of the importance of space intelligence and information in the future and particularly in the face of the reality that United States has started to seize space superiority , many Russian military experts have in recent years held that the space of a battlefield of the 21st century will extend to the outer space and that a future war can be won only by occupying a place in the space .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
Shi Guangsheng : The Foreign Trade Minister meeting is an important routine meeting of APEC that is held once every year .  Ministers and officials of every member state hold discussions and seek mutual understanding on major issues impacting global and Asia-Pacific regional economic and trade development .  The meeting serves as preparation for the Joint Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministerial meeting and the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting scheduled to be held at the end of this year .  
With regard to the promotion of a new round of WTO talks being an important agenda for this Foreign Trade Minister meeting , we hope that this meeting will lead to widespread common understanding among APEC member regions and will send out a clear signal to the international community that APEC supports a new round of talks .  This will be helpful in achieving an earlier launch of a new round of talks .  
If in trying to understand joint operations , we failed to recognize the temporal background and essential characteristics of their birth and development or failed to recognize the essential distinction between informationized warfare and mechanized warfare , it would tie our understanding down to the level of concerted and combined operations .  Consequently , the commanding ideology would lag behind the times .  
Studying and understanding are the key to promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members and to consistently promote this educational campaign at a high starting level , according to high standards and high quality criteria .  
To promote this campaign in a profound and solid manner and make gratifying achievements , the Party organization at all levels must , in close association with reality , consistently regard comprehensively studying , profoundly understanding and accurately sticking to the important thinking of the " three represents " as the key link , adopt effective measures and make great achievements .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
Only when leaders of Party committees and Party members working for institutions take the lead in profoundly studying , thoroughly comprehending and understanding the important thinking of the " three represents " in light of other aspects can they solve problems met by Party members working for grassroots units and satisfactorily provide military grassroots units with correct and effective guidance in promoting this educational campaign .  
Marching forward through continuous exploration is not only an important characteristic in the painstaking development in the 20th century , but also the key to correctly understanding many crucial and major issues in the Chinese revolution and construction .  
Since 1996 when the " Shanghai Five " mechanism was started , through years of unremitting efforts , the five nations have made substantial advances in settling the border issues left over from history in a sense of urgency to " end the past and open up the future " and in accordance with the principle of " consultations on an equal footing and mutual understanding and mutual accommodation " , thus turning the 7,300-kilometer common borderline into a security tie linking friendship and cooperation between the five nations .  
However , contrary to what the author expects , it is entirely legal and logical for the National People 's Congress to interpret laws in accordance with the principle of " one country , two systems " .  Further , the interpretation of the law has helped safeguard the dignity of the Basic Law and laid a foundation for Hong Kong 's long-term prosperity and stability .  It is entirely in the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people , and it has won the understanding and support of the vast number of Hong Kong citizens .  
Zhang Qiyue pointed out : The normalization of Sino-Macedonian relations has once again demonstrated that China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity is inalienable .  The Chinese Government 's one-China principled stand has gained the understanding and support from vast majorities of nations and the international community .  Any attempt and practice to split China will work to no avail .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
Reviewing and summarizing the glorious 80-year history of our party , we have come to a more profound understanding that always integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the concrete practice of China 's revolution and construction , always firmly relying on the millions of people to acquire endless motive force for progress , and always comprehensively strengthening and improving party building in line with the party 's central task constitute the basic experience for our party to conquer hardships , maintain vigor , and make progress continuously .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
Localities and departments must get a clear understanding of the situation , achieve unity in thinking , enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility , buttress confidence , bring every positive factor into play , overcome difficulties , try in every possible way to realize this year 's targets for export growth in foreign trade , and make positive contributions to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
He said that in recent years the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries of China and Cuba have developed rapidly , there has been mutual understanding and support in the political field , economic cooperation has unceasingly expanded , various exchanges have increased day by day , and there is close cooperation in the midst of international struggle .  
It is essential to have a profound understanding of the long-term , arduous and complex nature of the work against corruption .  Not only is it necessary to be prepared for protracted battles , but also intensify our efforts to address current issues .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
and that the speech provides the key to many important questions of understanding , which have long perplexed and shackled our minds .  The speech emphasizes the necessity to carry out theoretical innovation by persistently integrating the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with realities in China ; and to emancipate our minds from outdated concepts and structures , from erroneous and dogmatic understanding of Marxism , and from the shackles of subjectivism and metaphysics .  
Hu Angang believes that , in a situation in which the rapid deceleration of the US economy is leading to a slowdown of the global economy , it is necessary to have an overall grasp and understanding of China 's present economic situation from the angle of historical development and a relative international perspective .  
In this speech , standing in the forefront of the times , setting his feet on new practice , and mastering the features of the times , Comrade Jiang Zemin applied the basic theory of Marxism to have studied and answered the important issues about the practice of building socialism , deepened the understanding about the laws governing communist parties holding power , governing the building of socialism , and governing the development of human society , thus making new contributions to enriching and developing Marxism .  
Through study and discussion , all people attending the meeting deeply realized that the important thinking on " three represents " set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a creative application of the basic theory of historical materialism , which is practiced in contemporary China . It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
In and after the 1980 ' s , our party also began to establish friendly relations with leftist , centralist , and right-wing political parties and their international organizations in the Western countries by transcending ideological differences and the disparity of social systems with the spirit of seeking understanding , dialogue , and cooperation .  
It is like water pouring off a steep roof , has tremendous momentum , has full and abundant connotation and profound thinking , and is a creative utilization and development of Marxism , Mao Zedong thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory .  It symbolizes the fact that our party has reached new heights , new levels , and new boundaries in its understanding of the rules of governance and construction ; in its understanding of the rules for socialist construction ;  
In the study of the speech , efforts should be focused on studying and understanding the party 's basic experience , the scientific connotations of the important thinking on " three represents , " the requirement for strengthening and improving party building , and party 's historical tasks and fighting targets in the new century .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
We should never rush headlong into mass action without first understanding these questions and we should never open the doors of Party organizations without holding those members of the new social strata who do not meet the requirements of membership and are erroneously recruited into the Party to a high standard of review or let them infringe on the Party 's nature as one of the vanguard of the working class and or pollute the advanced nature of our Party .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .  
After gaining an understanding of the Chinese communists ' deeds and plan for united front work , the case was raised to the level of national security and psychological strategies .  National security units and the staff officers ' headquarters have held a series of meetings to study ways and means of tackling the problem , and President Chen will be hearing reports on the case .  
Today , President Jiang Zemin held talks with President Alexander Lukashenko and met Prime Minister Vladimir Yermoshin and speakers of the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic . They penetratingly and extensively exchanged opinions on bilateral relations and important issues of common concern , further expanded common views , and enhanced mutual understanding .  
We must start with an understanding of the actual situation in Xigaze , use as a foothold the abundant local resources , and work hard to develop the production of high-quality , highly effective , distinctive agricultural and livestock products .  
All levels of discipline inspection and supervision organs and all cadres involved in the discipline inspection and supervision work must have an in-depth understanding of the scientific content of the major thinking of the " Three Represents , " implement the " Three Represents " requirements in the entire process of the discipline inspection and supervision work , further intensify the party work style building and clean administration building and the anti-corruption work , and constantly score new results in the anti-corruption work and in the promotion of clean administration building .  
President Jiang Said : " In this visit to your honorable country , I want to increase my understanding of your honorable country ; to exchange deep ideas with president De Marko and other leaders of your honorable country concerning developing relations between our two countries , and international problems of mutual concern ; to have broad contact with people in various fields in your country - - doing all this to increase the friendship between the people 's of the two countries , and to propel the development of Sino-Maltese relations to a new standard . 
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
The 16 November letter indicated that , " Your association 's representatives propose that at this working discussion , with the precondition of mutual understanding , each side will use the verbal statement method to express the one-China principle , and propose the specific content of the expression , and this will make it explicit that both sides of the strait support the one-China principle .  This content will thereafter be conveyed to Taiwan publications . "  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech indicates that the important " three represents " thinking has become a complete theoretical system , that our party 's understanding of the objective laws governing the building of our party as a ruling party has reached a new level , and that the development of the Marxist theory on party building has developed to a new stage .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
To profoundly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , the meeting decided to adopt several measures on the basis of study : first , the central group of the Central Discipline-Inspection Commission would set aside a period of time for carefully studying and discussing specific topics in Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , so as to achieve a profound understanding and accurate grasp of the spiritual essence .  
Through study , further improve the capability for observing and handling issues from a political perspective , achieve a profound understanding of the spirit of advancing with the passage of time , work hard to adapt to the profound changes in the party ' s tasks and ruling environment , and change outdated ideas , practices , and working mechanisms .  
The Korean government issued a statement that " expressed deep regret " and emphasized that " if Prime Minister Koizumi wishes to build genuine friendly relations with neighboring countries , then he must respect the outlook of those countries and the feelings of their people , based on an accurate understanding of history . "  
Specifically speaking , it is necessary to create a rather positive working environment , a harmonious and agreeable environment of interpersonal relationships , an academic environment that is democratic and lively , a rather comfortable living environment , and a social environment that is respectful and understanding .  
Various units , in conducting training classes on rotation basis for leading cadres at and above regimental level , have guided the participants to emancipate their minds , take a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts , study and grasp the newest theoretical achievements of the speech , and lay stress on penetratingly understanding and fully grasping the basic viewpoints and spirit of the speech .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Our thorough study , correct understanding , and proper implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech in the new century is bound to turn the spiritual strength of the Speech into tremendous material strength and spur our party and state undertakings to advance from victory to victory .  
The " Declaration " calls on developed countries to consider their moral obligation and duty to bridge the growing " digital divide " and to play a positive role in promoting international cooperation , mutual understanding , and peace .  
Party committees , governments , and political and legal organs at various levels must have a better understanding , firmly implement the spirit of the national conference on public order work , overcome the mood of relaxation and struggle-weariness , further buttress confidence , and be determined to carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order unremittingly through to the end .  We must further highlight the key areas of struggle ;  
Guidance should be given to retired cadres as to broadening their horizons , updating their concepts , acquiring a profound understanding of the major theoretical and practical significance of the " speech , " maintaining political staunchness , frequently renewing their thinking , keeping up with the times , and always preserving the nature of CPC members .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .

We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
China and the United States have had reciprocal visits by their respective leaders , and have achieved a common understanding on numerous issues of common concern .

"  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation .

The visits will increase their mutual understanding and enhance their cooperation in international and regional affairs .  
Observers are convinced that the extensive common understanding reached by leaders of the two countries in their meetings and the joint communique signed by leaders of the two countries constitute a telling blow to Xinjiang 's separatist force in Turkey .

Through this round of visits , China has strengthened high-level contacts with the nations concerned , promoted the further development of bilateral relations with them , enhanced mutual understanding with them , and strengthened cooperation with them in international and regional affairs .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .

We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
China and the United States have had reciprocal visits by their respective leaders , and have achieved a common understanding on numerous issues of common concern .  Furthermore , the " joint Sino-U.S . statement " issued by the two countries pointed out that " as powers in the Asian-Pacific region , China and the United States wish to enhance their cooperation and deal jointly with the various challenges that are faced in order to make a positive contribution to the promotion of stability and prosperity in the region .

Efforts made to develop the domestic economy and increase overall national strength will be the powerful foundation for eventually settling the Taiwan issue .  
Sun Yuxi said : President Jiang 's upcoming visits will be an important diplomatic move made by China at the turn of the century .  The purpose of the visits are to step up high-level exchange between China and the aforementioned six countries , ensure further development of bilateral relations , and exchange views with them on the current international situation and the situations in regions of concern , in order to enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation on international and regional affairs .  
President Jiang 's current visits to the six countries is China 's important diplomatic action at the turn of the century aimed at strengthening high-level contacts between China and the above-mentioned six countries to further develop their bilateral ties and exchange views on the international and relevant regional situation .  The visits will increase their mutual understanding and enhance their cooperation in international and regional affairs .  
Observers are convinced that the extensive common understanding reached by leaders of the two countries in their meetings and the joint communique signed by leaders of the two countries constitute a telling blow to Xinjiang 's separatist force in Turkey . Meanwhile , such common understanding has removed obstacles in the full development of relations between the two countries in the new century .  
Through this round of visits , China has strengthened high-level contacts with the nations concerned , promoted the further development of bilateral relations with them , enhanced mutual understanding with them , and strengthened cooperation with them in international and regional affairs .  
The perspective given to people from the meaning within the words was not so much wanting to show good intentions , but hinging on the elaborate style of the wording , seemed to show the new official Taiwan leadership is lacking sufficient understanding of the serious situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . The cunning application of wording was greater than that allotted to practical considerations , and the elaborate portion was greater than the revealing of sincere feelings .  
" We are of the opinion that the two sides can create a favorable condition for reaching an ultimate reasonable solution to the issue , so long as they respect historical facts and make friendly consultations based on the principle of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation . "  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
The side of the mainland motherland has also repeatedly expressed welcoming the visits of all the political parties , organizations , and personages from all circles in Taiwan , so as to exchange views and enhance common understanding on jointly opposing " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait relations , and pushing forward the progress of peaceful reunification .  
Meanwhile , the CSHRS must continue to take an active part in international human rights activities ; conduct more dialogues , exchanges , and cooperation with foreign organizations and personages ; and make unremitting efforts to enhance understanding and cooperation between the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world in upholding human rights , expand consensus unceasingly , and jointly promote the international community 's universal respect of human rights and basic freedom .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin praised highly the visit of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il at the important historical moment of the turn of the century .  He maintained that the current visit is of important significance to further improvement of mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and two countries , and to the promotion of development of Sino-DPRK friendly relations [ zhong chao you hao guan xi ] oriented toward the new century .  
It is in the course of developing normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries and in its struggle aimed at safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that the Chinese Government has adhered to the One China principle and has won both understanding and support from a growing number of countries and international organizations .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
Both sides have agreed to promote the development of the national economy through economic cooperation , and to enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust by boosting cooperation and exchange in the social , cultural , sports , public health , environment , and other fields .  
He encouraged them to work hard and have a profound understanding of China 's independent foreign policy of peace .  He urged them to make active efforts to carry out their work .  He also urged them to introduce China 's situation to personages of political as well as other sectors in Slovenia so as to increase their understanding about China .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the two parties ' improving relations on the peninsula is in accord with both sides ' fundamental interests and with the common aspirations of the Korean nationality .  He expressed the belief that the meeting would enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides , promote both sides ' exchanges and cooperation in various fields , and ultimately create an excellent opening for realizing independence and peaceful unification on the peninsula .  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
The circular demanded : We should deepen theory study by taking the important thinking of " three represents " as a core content and should further deepen understanding of the basic theoretical view of " three stresses , " and invigorate and grasp study in a down-to-earth manner in light of the characteristics at the grass-roots level and in various forms . 
Tian Jiyun said it is necessary to gain a clear understanding of the challenges of the domestic and international situations , resolutely implement Deng Xiaoping 's idea " development is of overriding importance , " promote development with reform , and seek stability through making development .  On the one hand , it is necessary to unswervingly regard economic construction as the center , speed up development , make our country strong and increase national strength .  
At a joint meeting held between Premier Zhu Rongji and the EU leaders in London two years ago , both parties reached a common understanding on accelerating the negotiation process of China 's accession to the World Trade Organization , ( WTO ) .

and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
To enhance understanding and increase consensus , the foreign ministries of the two countries set up a multilevel and multiform political consultation system , under which the two foreign ministers exchange visits and meet at the UN General Assembly and foreign ministry officials hold regular consultations .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
When we interviewed some party 's theoretical workers in the capital and other places , they all expressed the same understanding with different languages , pointing out that history and the people have chosen the CPC because it represents the advanced social productive forces , the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the great majority of the people since it was founded . 
Adequately understanding the importance and urgency of cultural construction in line with the requirements of its 15th National Congress and from the height of the prosperity of the socialist cause and national rejuvenation is an important prerequisite for the entire party to better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
During the visit , the two heads of state held talks , and in a constructive atmosphere of mutual understanding , discussed the question of further developing the two countries ' relations of good neighborliness , friendship , and cooperation , and also exchanged views and reached broad consensus on international and regional issues of common concern .  
Your Excellency the President has paid three visits to China . This , together with the summit meetings of the five nations and other international occasions , has enabled us to meet on more than 10 occasions and to establish good working relations and personal friendship .  This has played a very important role in deepening mutual understanding and trust and promoting the development of relations of good-neighborliness , friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  
They point out that continual talks will be held between China and Russia and between China and Tajikistan on thoroughly solving the remaining border issues as quickly as possible on the basis of the current border treaties according to the universally recognized norms of international law , through negotiation on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation .

All sides point out that the agreements reached between the five countries in settling border issues and enhancing military trust have embodied a new security view that is built on mutual trust , equality , and cooperation ; are conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and good-neighborly relations ; and have contributed in a constructive manner to ensuring stability in this extensive region .  
During the visits , with specific targets in mind Chairman Li Peng expounded and re-stressed the principled standpoints and viewpoints of China on some important international and regional issues and acquired comprehensive common understanding with the leaders of these six countries .  
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
The above mutual understanding regarding specific issues that was reached by the two leaders made both sides more full of confidence regarding the prospects for relations between China and Italy , which have numerous points in common politically , have strong complementary natures economically , and have great potential for development .  
They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .  Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Reasons for achieving this are as follows : First , all previous governments of the two countries and their leaders paid high attention to the development of bilateral relations .  Leaders of the older generations of the two countries threw lots of energy into the causes of friendship between the two countries .  Like leaders of the older generations , leaders of the new generation of the two countries have maintained close contacts , intensified mutual trust and understanding , and provided guarantees for promoting an in-depth development of contacts and cooperation in all fields .  
During the visit , Hu said that he would call on his Excellency President Abdurahman Wahid , exchange views with Megawati in a frank and sincere manner on bilateral relations and issues of common concern , and meet well-known Indonesian personages from all walks of life .

Hu Jintao separately met and held talks with the heads of states , heads of governments , and parliamentary leaders of the five countries .  He also had extensive contacts with people from various circles .  His visit had enhanced mutual understanding , promoted bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation , and pushed forward the comprehensive development of bilateral relations between China and the five countries .  
Hu Jintao 's visit was a complete success and it attained the goal of extensively making friends , enhancing understanding , having eyes on the long-term future , and deepening cooperation .  It will surely produce a far-reaching impact on the development of the comprehensive friendly cooperation between China and the five countries in the 21st century and play an import role in stabilizing and strengthening the friendly relations between China and its neighbors .  
Both sides unanimously agreed to make concerted efforts to build up good neighborly and friendly relations and to settle problems that are currently existing in their bilateral relations , with a view to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship and to promoting mutual exchanges in all fields .  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
Since assuming office , Taiwan 's new leader has adopted a delaying , evasive approach toward the one-China principle , denying that the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Strait Exchange Foundation had in 1992 reached a common understanding on the one-China principle .  He has changed his wording again and again and yet had no clear and definite measures for easing and improving cross-strait relations and thus has been ridiculed by the Taiwan media as " having saliva of goodwill of a volume enough to drown people but taking no visible action . "  
The rapid development of the Internet has played an important role in bringing about world economic growth and the strengthening of contacts among the people of various countries .  However , we must realize that there exist some problems regarding the Internet that make people worried : There is an overflow of junk information that is anti-science , pseudo-science , unhealthy or even very harmful .  Some people intentionally publish information that does not conform to the truth to mislead people 's understanding about the true situation .  
Ye Xuanping said : The CPPCC and the DPRK Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland have maintained close exchanges over the last few years .

It has been helpful in reducing misunderstandings and has laid a new foundation for further increasing exchanges and cooperation between American and Chinese religious circles .  
We must stand in the front ranks of the age , observing the world through the broad perspective of Marxism , having a sober understanding of the opportunities and challenges that general development trends in the world today pose for China , seizing opportunities and forging ahead , accelerating the strengthening of our economic and national defense capabilities and our national solidarity , and ensuring that China 's drive to modernization achieves a comprehensive victory in the new century .  
During the Yanan rectification campaign , Comrade Zhang Wentian seriously conducted self-criticism and dissected himself .  In the spirit of " making up missed lessons , " he went deep into reality , to the basic level , and among the masses to carry out investigation and study and enhance understanding in China 's rural economic and social situation .  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
it gained the understanding and respect of many people with a sense of justice .  He expressed the hope that the religious bodies will as always act in accordance with the principle of running their religions in an independent fashion and making their own decisions , as laid down by the constitution , strengthen their own building , cultivate talented people for international religious exchanges who love the country and their religion , actively unfold friendly exchanges with foreign countries , and further advance on the world .

The visit produced important results .  
We hope that more figures from American media circles will visit China and promote understanding of China , and also hope that the American media will report on China in objective and accurate fashion , so as to play a still more positive role in promoting mutual understanding , friendship , and cooperation between the Chinese and American peoples , and to push forward the healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations .

Uruguay is satisfied with this .

Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .

With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .

They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .

Even though the specific behaviors of and causes of the problems of some leading bodies and leading cadres in the aspect of party spirit and party styles are not completely identical , they are all directly related to their insufficient theoretical study .

When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
As for giving oneself up to avoid prosecution , we have discovered that collective corruption is most severe . This kind of corruption is fairly invisible and highly contagious . In some departments , newcomers will be pressured to engage in the same corruption , and once everyone has " greased their palms , " they 'll have a tacit understanding that pockets are padded .  
It 's the place which bore and suckled us . . . we are bound to her not only by understanding , but also by life and emotion . . . no matter how her lofty mountains and sparkling waters may be despoiled , her deep human intimacy diluted , as long as we live on this island of Taiwan , she will always be home to our spirits , " Su Wen-kui , editor of the periodical Hu Wei Chieh wrote in an article .  
If you want to understand traditional Yami culture , you have to get back to the tribal village . Only through such everyday experiences as building Yami boats and going out at night to catch flying fish will one come to an intuitive understanding of the deep meaning behind related legends , taboos and customs .

However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
We had been raised and educated in China , " Yuan says , and they began to feel that being Chinese gave them a lot beyond obvious differences in custom . " For instance , it made us loyal and sincere , hard working , persevering . . . I hope my child has learned these traits in addition to a basic understanding of morality . "  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Chuo Ko-hua , a scholar of folk customs and ancient monuments who has spent time studying divination poems and who also has an understanding of Chinese herbal medicine , says that the remedies prescribed by medicinal oracles were not powerful and were mainly tonics , but they could sometimes cure minor ailments .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians . Nevertheless , the training process of veterinary medicine lacks a fitting understanding of canine population expansion .  
The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs . At a time of limited understanding of sanitary principles , when many Taiwanese children were malnourished , how Peng 's childhood differed from the vast majority of Taiwanese !  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Q : In 1985 , when Peter Brook used an abandoned quarry at Avignon for a nine-hour performance by actors from various countries of the Hindu epic poem Mahabharata , many people hailed the production as a successful blend of numerous cultural elements . But others felt that Brook did not have a deep enough understanding of Hindu thought , so that the work was another example of oriental exoticism .  
Yet there is a sharp contrast . Japanese media have long been concerned about cross-strait relations , have deep understanding of the situation , and handled stories in a low-key fashion . US reports , on the other hand , tended to be more provocative and intense ; US reports also used more varied sources and had a more international perspective .  
I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
With repeated visits came deepened understanding , more mutual trust , firm friendships all the more relished for their regular renewals . Gradually I find myself striving to take on more of the traits I admire among my friends in Yunnan-a warm view of hospitality , a greater appreciation of natural surroundings , a resilience to ill fortune and calamities beyond one 's control and more inclination to enjoy to the fullest the good times that inevitably follow .  
Recently another incident was big news : a Maori activist was caught trying to cut down the Monterey pine on One Tree Hill , which was planted last century by British settlers . The New Zealand government spent over NZ $ 10,000 to save the tree , but the Maori finally received a suspended sentence because the court was understanding of his feelings about history .  
Most readers will have at least a sketchy understanding of the story that followed : Bo Yang was thrown into jail on charges of " stirring up trouble between the government and the people . " For nearly ten years , people were n't sure if he was dead or alive , and Taiwan 's society was that much more hushed without him . Yet the people 's passion for freedom and democracy had not been extinguished .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
He avers that married couples have been through a long process of falling in love , marriage , and living together , which provides a foundation of emotional attachment and understanding . When divorce becomes inevitable , the two people have already been through repeated internal struggles .  
Jan Jyh-horng responded that although Taipei has never sought to avoid political negotiations aimed at eventual reunification , both Beijing and Taipei would first have to approach such negotiations with a common understanding that " the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by separate and equal entities . "  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
Recently , at the invitation of Taipei City Government , Morris Chang , chairman of the powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) , delivered a lecture entitled " New Recruits for the 21st Century . " The specification he described for modern employees included these requirements : The ability to actively participate in political and social work ; an international perspective ; taking pleasure in cooperative endeavor ; a good general understanding of science and technology ; and the ability to think independently . Finally , they should be " specialized all-rounders . "  
In his autobiography , Chang reveals that the key period which shaped his life was the year he spent at Harvard at age 18 . Compulsory courses there included an extensive review of the Western classics , and this not only allowed him to become familiar with the development of Western culture , but also laid down the foundations of his understanding of the humanities .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
As for how serious the situation should become before closing schools , Chen Chien-jen , a professor at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology at NTU 's School of Public Health , pointed out that judgment about the seriousness of an outbreak requires an objective decision based on an understanding of the communicability of a disease , the number and density of people who are infected , and the rate of secondary infection , as well as other epidemiological data , and should not be based on a subjective considerations .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Tsai Shu-ying , a math instructor at the Taipei Municipal Teachers ' College , points out that when she teaches elementary and junior high school students who are confused about fractions , instead of overemphasizing the textbook , she uses cup measurements or a ruler and rope so that students can " play " with the concept of proportion . Then she uses jigsaw puzzles that have been colored one color so as to give students an understanding of the principles behind mathematical operations .  
Just as there are major gaps in outsiders ' understanding of aboriginal culture in general , more detailed research needs to be carried out about the mathematical conceptions of aborigines . This research should be broken down according to age , tribe , area , social situation , and so forth . It 's wrong to make a sweeping generalization and say that " aborigines ' poor performance in math is or is not related to culture , " argues Wang Wei-chang , a photographer who often visits aboriginal communities .  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .  
Besides showing earning potential , responsibility , and trust , they say , the ideal male would also be emotionally honest , interested in life , understanding of others , open to continued personal growth , and always considerate of the woman 's feelings .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
She was dumbfounded when he came back with the rubber suction cup for a plunger . Chinese who go to America all have difficulty with understanding slang expressions like " standing someone up , " or the meaning of " yield " in traffic signs , or that what they know as " hiding from the kitty " is called " peekaboo " in English and that when describing someone unattractive , it is better to say " plain " instead of " ugly . "  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
On May 20 , President Chen was officially sworn in at a ceremony carried out inside the Presidential Palace . Afterwards he went outside to deliver his inaugural address to a waiting audience in the square in front of the Presidential Palace , at which point he repeated the pose that he had assumed while taking the oath . The president did not salute anyone , and I would like to assure Mr . Lin that his gesture did not have any Nazi implications . We beg Mr . Lin 's understanding regarding this issue .  
Quoting Bo Yang , Chen said , " For all the mistakes and abuses committed in the past , we can be understanding , tolerant and forgiving , but we can never forget-because those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it . " In response to human rights problems , Chen said that every nation must work to raise awareness and education , uphold international standards , and create legal mechanisms for promoting and protecting human rights .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Understanding the structure of the universe is a long-standing dream of astronomers . In the past our understanding of cosmic structure was based on little more than theoretical speculation . Before 1990 , it was difficult to test the plethora of cosmological theories being put forward by a growing number of brilliant theorists .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Chu reasoned that the initial translation was too dry to be successful . Moreover , the first translator 's understanding of the fantasy genre was too limited to fully evoke the fantastic macrocosm that Tolkien depicted in his work . Chu promised that this time around he would provide a much more vivid translation .  
In this issue are stories on the latest trends and options for graduate study , the changing structure of Taiwan 's population , the impact of environmental hormones , the community regeneration movement in aboriginal villages in eastern Taiwan , the legendary master of glove puppetry Huang Hai-tai , the beginning of efforts to stage Nobel Prize laureate Gao Xingjian 's Snow in August , and celebrities such as Angie Chai and Chien Wen-hsiu .

With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ ï¿½g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
The site-which has been a tourist attraction ever since the quake hit-has been preserved and turned into an earthquake education park , complete with a museum .

Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
Apart from the medicinal herb exhibition and the free clinics ( Paosheng is , after all , the god of medicine ) , there was also a photo exhibition ( " The Beauty of Paoan Temple " ) by master photographer Ko Hsi-chieh , as well as seminars on religious ceremonies , a guided tour to the art of altars , and folk arts and crafts workshops designed for the 3-day chingcheng jiao that began on June 13th .

When art therapy , which uses mental symbols and intuition , is applied to mental illness , sexual abuse , child abuse cases , or to children whose verbal understanding is limited , it is able to gradually lower the patient 's defense mechanisms , build a better relationship between patient and therapist and unearth the old stories that lie buried in the deepest recesses of the subconscious .  
After his understanding of the limits of the tensile and torsional strength of eggs , he used the principle of the screw to fashion an interlocking ring of five eggs .

He called it " Lost in Dense Clouds . "  
Sister Therese says women spend varying amounts of time in the Good Shepherd center . During an average two-week to three-month stay of an urgent case , the social workers first try to get an understanding of the new bride 's background and situation .

He displayed his deep understanding of life 's mysteries in his carving Intermingling Grief and Joy , in which an entire body , save the head , appeared to be melting .

Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?

With regard to the shocking nature of both the Body Worlds exhibit and the abortion film , all of the above scholars agree that without accompanying documents , lectures , explanations or discussions to allay audience anxieties , simply relying on what is visually apparent will not suffice to reveal the true meaning of life education .

Master Hong Yi himself can be considered the first person to have introduced Western aesthetics to China . He was not only thoroughly familiar with the principles and sensibilities behind Western painting , drama , and music , but had a similarly profound understanding of Chinese poetry , painting , and calligraphy .

Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Recently , this reporter went to a place in Hebei for assignment .  Arriving at the office of the county government , this reporter explained the intent of investigating and understanding some conditions reported by farmers .  The director of the county government office who received this reporter let out a long heavy sigh and said : " In recent years , our organizations at the grass-roots level have been weak .  The cadres dare not speak or take any actions .  The farmers are spoiled as a result . "  
Guided by the central departments concerned , the Hong Kong Garrison persistently regarded studying or understanding the law as a basic project ; intensified both legal education and behavioral guidance ; and enabled both the articles and spirit of the Hong Kong Garrison Law to take root in the hearts of all the officers and men and become a conscious sense among them as well .  
The garrison has introduced an external spokesman system and has regularly held Open Day at its barracks with an eye on enhancing understanding or communication between itself and the Hong Kong public .  Practice has shown that the garrison has established fine , harmonious , and mutual-trust army-government relations with the SAR government and has forcefully safeguarded a high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong SAR in such a special environment as " One Country , Two Systems " .  
An absolute majority of the social organizations or people in Hong Kong have supported or cherished the garrison in a variety of ways ; have agreed that the Hong Kong Garrison is entitled in accordance with the law to all rights , interests , or exemptions as demanded by its duties ; and have shown full understanding for the training , exercises , or other military activities held by the garrison in line with its defense duties .  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
To study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we must get an ever clearer understanding of the requirements of the new situation for ideological and political work , enhance our sense of suffering , not lose sight of the importance of ideological and political work , foster the sense of urgency in doing a good job of the work , see of the protracted nature , complexity , and arduousness of the work , and make adequate mental preparations to carry out the work in the long term .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Frequent visits by leaders of the two parliaments and their special committees in recent years , as well as the extensive exchanges in legislation , parliamentary cooperation , bilateral ties , and international issues of common concern during these visits , have enhanced mutual understanding and trust .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
Currently we should put our efforts into in-depth understanding of the specific meaning of preparations for the military struggle in the new period , clarifying the possible specific operational tasks and operational modes we might carry out , and completing training and training the troops to elite status .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .  Exaggerating differences and inciting antagonism can only deceive the people for some time and can not deceive them forever .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China . The US media have the habit of exposing the negative aspects of China , not reporting or reporting less on the positive ones , because the United States still has the arrogant complex of being a big country .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
When one lacks a skeptical critical spirit and reveres all existing understanding as the absolute , the road to scientific progress , passing , breaking new ground , and innovation would be blocked .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
With history as a guide and the future as his orientation , he worked hard to reach a consensus with both the Japanese government and Japanese outside the government on deepening the partnership of friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  As a result , mutual understanding was deepened , the political foundation of bilateral relations was reinforced , and the development of friendly cooperation in all fields was given a boost .  At the same time , there remain in Japan the soil and climate for the growth of militarism .  
Fourth , the mutual visits and reunion of separated families of both sides and the fluttering of " flags of both sides on the Korean peninsula " during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games increased understanding between the north and the south , and expressed their wishes of realizing peaceful reunification through self-reliance .  
All these have enhanced mutual understanding and trust between China and its neighboring countries , strengthened good neighborly relations and cooperation , and contributed to realizing a stable peripheral environment .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
Under the impetus of economic globalization , humanity has expanded its interaction , its contacts , and its understanding , and increased friendship , cooperation , and support .  Various converging and intermingling cultural torrents have smashed the " iron curtain " between countries with different social systems and ideologies , marking a new era in the ways countries compete and test their strength against one another .  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
During his US visit , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian has stepped up dialogues and exchanges , sought common grounds while reserving or narrowing differences , increased common understanding , expanded cooperation , and implemented the important consensus reached between the two heads of state on jointly promoting bilateral relations .  
The two sides conducted extensive , constructive , and frank and sincere dialogue ; increased mutual understanding ; and expressed the wish to make a concerted effort to push forward Sino-US relations . "  
An editorial in Hong Kong 's Ta Kung Pao expressed the belief that during his visit to the United States , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian Qichen has strengthened dialogue and communication ; sought common ground while reserving or narrowing differences ; enhanced common understanding ;  
Here , however , we must warn the Taiwan authorities who show no understanding of the times that for the leader of the Taiwan authorities to be bent on planting the " independence " banner heedless of the desires of the people , and also to invite a gang of " friends of independence " from overseas is just like a blind man riding a blind horse approaching a deep pool at midnight , adding new danger on top of danger .  
Yang Jiechi , Chinese ambassador to the United States , chaired this evening 's function .  In his address , he said : Vice premier Qian 's visit to the United States has fulfilled the objectives of strengthening contact , improving understanding , expanding common consent , and developing cooperation .  It has given a powerful impetus to the development of Sino-US relations toward a sound and stable course .  
Qian Qichen said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin and President Bush exchanged letters and reached an important understanding on the development of Sino-US relations .  This demonstrates the strategic vision of the leaders and reflects the wishes of common citizens .  It points out a way forward for the effort to carry on from the past and forge ahead into the future in Sino-US relations .  
During the visit , the two sides conducted extensive , constructive , and frank and sincere dialogue ; increased mutual understanding ; and expressed the wish to make a concerted effort to push forward Sino-US relations .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Brazilian Ambassador Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said that Brazil and China are two important developing countries , adding that the two countries have had good ties of political cooperation and take an identical or similar stand on major international affairs .  He said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries would further cement bilateral relations and deepen mutual understanding and consensus between the two peoples .  
We are ready to make common efforts with Australia to increase mutual understanding and trust , promote friendship and cooperation , and push forward the continued steady and healthy development of bilateral military relations in the new situation .  
PRC vice premier Qian Qichen 's trip to the United States may have resulted in some mutual strategic understanding , and yielded some preliminary benefits , but at the same time , with the defection of PLA colonel Xu Junping and the blatant spy cases involving scholars traveling to the US , relations between the US and China have not been able to emerge from the shadows , and just now the possibility for worsening and more tense relations exists .  
Zhang Wannian 's current visit is carrying on the past traditions and opening a way for the future , which is aimed at increasing mutual understanding and trust , promoting friendly cooperation , and impelling the steady and healthy development of relations between the two countries and armies .  
On the one hand , we make constant efforts to perfect human rights in China , and on the other hand , we continue to engage in dialogue with foreign friends .  Only when dialogue proceeds from a level playing field , can we advance mutual understanding and promote mutual exchange and cooperation .  
The meeting stressed : To rectify and regulate the market economic order , the key is that we must reach a common understanding .  All localities and departments must attach great importance to and conscientiously bring into effect all the demands made by the State Council . First , we must have stronger leadership , division of labor in a responsible way , close cooperation , and concerted efforts .  
In actuality , during the 1980s , given the pressure of strong public opinion assigning blame for the history books , the Japanese Government was obligated to set a neighboring countries clause in terms of its textbooks , promising these countries that the textbook question would begin from the point of view of obtaining international understanding and international cooperation , and would be given the necessary review and reflection .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
Some British intelligence experts believe that due to such an " unexpected windfall , " the Chinese Communists ' electronic experts will be able to learn about the US forces ' reconnaissance system , counter-reconnaissance system , confrontation system , as well as other relevant technologies in a more comprehensive and in-depth way , or at least be able to broaden their mind or accumulate advance understanding about some weapons after studying the most advanced reconnaissance equipment in modern times .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
Over the past 20-odd years , ever since it was established , CITIC has witnessed relatively smooth development as it has benefited from a correct understanding or judgment of the global economic situation , and this is the key reason , and is inseparable from the work of the CITIC Consultation Committee .  
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze held talks with visiting Chinese State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing in Tbilisi on the afternoon of 13 April . Both sides exchanges views , in a thoroughgoing way , on political relations between China and Georgia , the exchange and cooperation in various fields of endeavor , and international local issues of common interest , and reached a broad consensus of understanding .  
A Communist China official confirmed that since 18 March last year , Chang Yung-fa , who is an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian , had been unable to visit the mainland due to political reason .  However , after " understanding " Chang Yung-fa has " once again " reiterated his stance of supporting the three direct links with the mainland , the Communist China 's leader approved Chang 's business trip to the mainland .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
President Jiang pointed out : China is willing to work together with various Latin American countries in pressing ahead with the establishment and development of long-term , stable , and all-round relations of cooperation between China and Latin America on the basis of equality and mutual benefit .  He also put forth four principles , namely , enhancing mutual understanding , treating each other as equals , and being trusted friends to each other ; strengthening consultations with each other , supporting each other , and safeguarding each other 's legitimate rights or interests in the world ;  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
The meeting required that party committees and organization departments at all levels should further unify thinking , enhance understanding , improve the style of work , effectively guarantee the fulfillment of the assignments , seize the opportune moment when local leading bodes at various levels will be changed , and raise the work of selecting , promoting , and training young cadres to a new level .  
It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
Governments and departments concerned nationwide must unify their understanding , strictly enforce orders and prohibitions , and make concerted efforts to resolutely break down the " fences " of regional blockades and establish and perfect a nationally unified great market of fair competition and regulated order .  
To properly accomplish the economic rural restructuring in our country , we must clearly understand and master the regularity in the evolution of agricultural and the rural economic structure , and then seize the key points based on such understanding , thus making advances in an orderly way .  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
In conducting education and training of middle-aged and young cadres , we must pay close attention mainly to two things : One is that we must help them master the basic tenets of Marxism , get a clear understanding of the objective laws governing the development of human society , and buttress confidence in taking the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics , and guide them to emancipate the mind , use their brains , conduct new explorations in the light of new realities , and promote innovations and development in Marxist theory .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Premier Zhu Rongji 's visit increased mutual understanding between China and the five countries , promoted bilateral economic and trade cooperation , consolidated and strengthened existing traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations , and expanded China 's influence .  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that Asia and Europe have different ideologies and policies , but the two sides have steadily enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and increased cooperation through equal and frank dialog and consultation at a high level on a regular basis . 
Organizing party and government organizations to help poor people at fixed points is of great significance to cadres ' understanding the national situation , the grassroots level and the people , to raising the cadres ability to solve actual problems , to maintaining close ties between the party and the people and to improving the work style of various offices .  
Nevertheless , following the gradual deepening of their understanding of the importance of space intelligence and information in the future and particularly in the face of the reality that United States has started to seize space superiority , many Russian military experts have in recent years held that the space of a battlefield of the 21st century will extend to the outer space and that a future war can be won only by occupying a place in the space .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
Shi Guangsheng : The Foreign Trade Minister meeting is an important routine meeting of APEC that is held once every year .  Ministers and officials of every member state hold discussions and seek mutual understanding on major issues impacting global and Asia-Pacific regional economic and trade development .  The meeting serves as preparation for the Joint Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministerial meeting and the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting scheduled to be held at the end of this year .  
With regard to the promotion of a new round of WTO talks being an important agenda for this Foreign Trade Minister meeting , we hope that this meeting will lead to widespread common understanding among APEC member regions and will send out a clear signal to the international community that APEC supports a new round of talks .  This will be helpful in achieving an earlier launch of a new round of talks .  
If in trying to understand joint operations , we failed to recognize the temporal background and essential characteristics of their birth and development or failed to recognize the essential distinction between informationized warfare and mechanized warfare , it would tie our understanding down to the level of concerted and combined operations .  Consequently , the commanding ideology would lag behind the times .  
Studying and understanding are the key to promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members and to consistently promote this educational campaign at a high starting level , according to high standards and high quality criteria .  
To promote this campaign in a profound and solid manner and make gratifying achievements , the Party organization at all levels must , in close association with reality , consistently regard comprehensively studying , profoundly understanding and accurately sticking to the important thinking of the " three represents " as the key link , adopt effective measures and make great achievements .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
Only when leaders of Party committees and Party members working for institutions take the lead in profoundly studying , thoroughly comprehending and understanding the important thinking of the " three represents " in light of other aspects can they solve problems met by Party members working for grassroots units and satisfactorily provide military grassroots units with correct and effective guidance in promoting this educational campaign .  
Marching forward through continuous exploration is not only an important characteristic in the painstaking development in the 20th century , but also the key to correctly understanding many crucial and major issues in the Chinese revolution and construction .  
Since 1996 when the " Shanghai Five " mechanism was started , through years of unremitting efforts , the five nations have made substantial advances in settling the border issues left over from history in a sense of urgency to " end the past and open up the future " and in accordance with the principle of " consultations on an equal footing and mutual understanding and mutual accommodation " , thus turning the 7,300-kilometer common borderline into a security tie linking friendship and cooperation between the five nations .  
However , contrary to what the author expects , it is entirely legal and logical for the National People 's Congress to interpret laws in accordance with the principle of " one country , two systems " .  Further , the interpretation of the law has helped safeguard the dignity of the Basic Law and laid a foundation for Hong Kong 's long-term prosperity and stability .  It is entirely in the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people , and it has won the understanding and support of the vast number of Hong Kong citizens .  
Zhang Qiyue pointed out : The normalization of Sino-Macedonian relations has once again demonstrated that China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity is inalienable .  The Chinese Government 's one-China principled stand has gained the understanding and support from vast majorities of nations and the international community .  Any attempt and practice to split China will work to no avail .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
Reviewing and summarizing the glorious 80-year history of our party , we have come to a more profound understanding that always integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the concrete practice of China 's revolution and construction , always firmly relying on the millions of people to acquire endless motive force for progress , and always comprehensively strengthening and improving party building in line with the party 's central task constitute the basic experience for our party to conquer hardships , maintain vigor , and make progress continuously .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
Localities and departments must get a clear understanding of the situation , achieve unity in thinking , enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility , buttress confidence , bring every positive factor into play , overcome difficulties , try in every possible way to realize this year 's targets for export growth in foreign trade , and make positive contributions to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
He said that in recent years the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries of China and Cuba have developed rapidly , there has been mutual understanding and support in the political field , economic cooperation has unceasingly expanded , various exchanges have increased day by day , and there is close cooperation in the midst of international struggle .  
It is essential to have a profound understanding of the long-term , arduous and complex nature of the work against corruption .  Not only is it necessary to be prepared for protracted battles , but also intensify our efforts to address current issues .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
and that the speech provides the key to many important questions of understanding , which have long perplexed and shackled our minds .  The speech emphasizes the necessity to carry out theoretical innovation by persistently integrating the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with realities in China ; and to emancipate our minds from outdated concepts and structures , from erroneous and dogmatic understanding of Marxism , and from the shackles of subjectivism and metaphysics .  
Hu Angang believes that , in a situation in which the rapid deceleration of the US economy is leading to a slowdown of the global economy , it is necessary to have an overall grasp and understanding of China 's present economic situation from the angle of historical development and a relative international perspective .  
In this speech , standing in the forefront of the times , setting his feet on new practice , and mastering the features of the times , Comrade Jiang Zemin applied the basic theory of Marxism to have studied and answered the important issues about the practice of building socialism , deepened the understanding about the laws governing communist parties holding power , governing the building of socialism , and governing the development of human society , thus making new contributions to enriching and developing Marxism .  
Through study and discussion , all people attending the meeting deeply realized that the important thinking on " three represents " set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a creative application of the basic theory of historical materialism , which is practiced in contemporary China . It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
In and after the 1980 ' s , our party also began to establish friendly relations with leftist , centralist , and right-wing political parties and their international organizations in the Western countries by transcending ideological differences and the disparity of social systems with the spirit of seeking understanding , dialogue , and cooperation .  
It is like water pouring off a steep roof , has tremendous momentum , has full and abundant connotation and profound thinking , and is a creative utilization and development of Marxism , Mao Zedong thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory .  It symbolizes the fact that our party has reached new heights , new levels , and new boundaries in its understanding of the rules of governance and construction ; in its understanding of the rules for socialist construction ;  
In the study of the speech , efforts should be focused on studying and understanding the party 's basic experience , the scientific connotations of the important thinking on " three represents , " the requirement for strengthening and improving party building , and party 's historical tasks and fighting targets in the new century .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
We should never rush headlong into mass action without first understanding these questions and we should never open the doors of Party organizations without holding those members of the new social strata who do not meet the requirements of membership and are erroneously recruited into the Party to a high standard of review or let them infringe on the Party 's nature as one of the vanguard of the working class and or pollute the advanced nature of our Party .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .

So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
The 16 November letter indicated that , " Your association 's representatives propose that at this working discussion , with the precondition of mutual understanding , each side will use the verbal statement method to express the one-China principle , and propose the specific content of the expression , and this will make it explicit that both sides of the strait support the one-China principle .  This content will thereafter be conveyed to Taiwan publications . "  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech indicates that the important " three represents " thinking has become a complete theoretical system , that our party 's understanding of the objective laws governing the building of our party as a ruling party has reached a new level , and that the development of the Marxist theory on party building has developed to a new stage .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
To profoundly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , the meeting decided to adopt several measures on the basis of study : first , the central group of the Central Discipline-Inspection Commission would set aside a period of time for carefully studying and discussing specific topics in Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , so as to achieve a profound understanding and accurate grasp of the spiritual essence .

The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .

The perspective given to people from the meaning within the words was not so much wanting to show good intentions , but hinging on the elaborate style of the wording , seemed to show the new official Taiwan leadership is lacking sufficient understanding of the serious situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait .

So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
The above mutual understanding regarding specific issues that was reached by the two leaders made both sides more full of confidence regarding the prospects for relations between China and Italy , which have numerous points in common politically , have strong complementary natures economically , and have great potential for development .  
They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .  Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Reasons for achieving this are as follows : First , all previous governments of the two countries and their leaders paid high attention to the development of bilateral relations .  Leaders of the older generations of the two countries threw lots of energy into the causes of friendship between the two countries .  Like leaders of the older generations , leaders of the new generation of the two countries have maintained close contacts , intensified mutual trust and understanding , and provided guarantees for promoting an in-depth development of contacts and cooperation in all fields .

He also had extensive contacts with people from various circles .  His visit had enhanced mutual understanding , promoted bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation , and pushed forward the comprehensive development of bilateral relations between China and the five countries .  
Hu Jintao 's visit was a complete success and it attained the goal of extensively making friends , enhancing understanding , having eyes on the long-term future , and deepening cooperation .  It will surely produce a far-reaching impact on the development of the comprehensive friendly cooperation between China and the five countries in the 21st century and play an import role in stabilizing and strengthening the friendly relations between China and its neighbors .  
Both sides unanimously agreed to make concerted efforts to build up good neighborly and friendly relations and to settle problems that are currently existing in their bilateral relations , with a view to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship and to promoting mutual exchanges in all fields .  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
Since assuming office , Taiwan 's new leader has adopted a delaying , evasive approach toward the one-China principle , denying that the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Strait Exchange Foundation had in 1992 reached a common understanding on the one-China principle .  He has changed his wording again and again and yet had no clear and definite measures for easing and improving cross-strait relations and thus has been ridiculed by the Taiwan media as " having saliva of goodwill of a volume enough to drown people but taking no visible action . "  
The rapid development of the Internet has played an important role in bringing about world economic growth and the strengthening of contacts among the people of various countries .  However , we must realize that there exist some problems regarding the Internet that make people worried : There is an overflow of junk information that is anti-science , pseudo-science , unhealthy or even very harmful .  Some people intentionally publish information that does not conform to the truth to mislead people 's understanding about the true situation .

It has been helpful in reducing misunderstandings and has laid a new foundation for further increasing exchanges and cooperation between American and Chinese religious circles .  
We must stand in the front ranks of the age , observing the world through the broad perspective of Marxism , having a sober understanding of the opportunities and challenges that general development trends in the world today pose for China , seizing opportunities and forging ahead , accelerating the strengthening of our economic and national defense capabilities and our national solidarity , and ensuring that China 's drive to modernization achieves a comprehensive victory in the new century .  
During the Yanan rectification campaign , Comrade Zhang Wentian seriously conducted self-criticism and dissected himself .  In the spirit of " making up missed lessons , " he went deep into reality , to the basic level , and among the masses to carry out investigation and study and enhance understanding in China 's rural economic and social situation .  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
it gained the understanding and respect of many people with a sense of justice .  He expressed the hope that the religious bodies will as always act in accordance with the principle of running their religions in an independent fashion and making their own decisions , as laid down by the constitution , strengthen their own building , cultivate talented people for international religious exchanges who love the country and their religion , actively unfold friendly exchanges with foreign countries , and further advance on the world .

The visit produced important results .  
We hope that more figures from American media circles will visit China and promote understanding of China , and also hope that the American media will report on China in objective and accurate fashion , so as to play a still more positive role in promoting mutual understanding , friendship , and cooperation between the Chinese and American peoples , and to push forward the healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations .

Watt 's invention of the steam engine triggered the first industrial revolution and had a far-reaching and profound impact on human society .

With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .

They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .

And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .

Even though the specific behaviors of and causes of the problems of some leading bodies and leading cadres in the aspect of party spirit and party styles are not completely identical , they are all directly related to their insufficient theoretical study .

Though discussions , they have unified their thinking and understanding and taken an active part in the theoretical study .  
When the talks were about to conclude , the SEF representative proposed three more forms of expression and also produced the content of their final expression : " Although in the course of the common efforts of both sides in pursuing national reunification , both sides uphold the one China principle , they have different understanding regarding the meaning of one China .

However , we are of the view that the CFA 's interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 of the Basic Law differs from the SAR Government 's understanding of the legislative intent of the provisions .  The CFA judgment has increased tremendously the number of people who are qualified for ROA in Hong Kong , which would impose a severe social and economic burden on Hong Kong . ExCo has decided that the Chief Executive should report to the Central Authorities and request for an interpretation of the relevant articles of the Basic Law .

Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .

Although mainland China 's initial responses are far from friendly , you still keep calling on them to make a rational choice . I think the people are most concerned with the question of when conditions may become ripe . What I mean is that given your understanding and knowledge of the world situation and the political developments in mainland China , when do you think conditions will become ripe for talks between the two sides as equals ? Thank you , Mr . President .  
If a local can under-take recording and explanatory fieldwork in advance it helps give a better insight into the subject , and the lack of obstacles to communication and understanding makes it easier for him to organize scattered and fragmentary materials and so arrive at more meaningful and detailed results . " This is how Wang Sung-shan , currently a research assistant at the National Science Museum , regards Ch'en Chien-ming 's role vis-a-vis other workers in the field .

The museum enables employees to gain a concrete idea of just how we built up our corporate reputation and an understanding of what each department does , " explains the museum 's director , Wu Mu-hsiang .

When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
As for giving oneself up to avoid prosecution , we have discovered that collective corruption is most severe . This kind of corruption is fairly invisible and highly contagious .

However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
We had been raised and educated in China , " Yuan says , and they began to feel that being Chinese gave them a lot beyond obvious differences in custom . " For instance , it made us loyal and sincere , hard working , persevering . . . I hope my child has learned these traits in addition to a basic understanding of morality . "  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Chuo Ko-hua , a scholar of folk customs and ancient monuments who has spent time studying divination poems and who also has an understanding of Chinese herbal medicine , says that the remedies prescribed by medicinal oracles were not powerful and were mainly tonics , but they could sometimes cure minor ailments .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians .

The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs .

Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Q : In 1985 , when Peter Brook used an abandoned quarry at Avignon for a nine-hour performance by actors from various countries of the Hindu epic poem Mahabharata , many people hailed the production as a successful blend of numerous cultural elements . But others felt that Brook did not have a deep enough understanding of Hindu thought , so that the work was another example of oriental exoticism .  
Yet there is a sharp contrast . Japanese media have long been concerned about cross-strait relations , have deep understanding of the situation , and handled stories in a low-key fashion . US reports , on the other hand , tended to be more provocative and intense ; US reports also used more varied sources and had a more international perspective .  
I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
With repeated visits came deepened understanding , more mutual trust , firm friendships all the more relished for their regular renewals . Gradually I find myself striving to take on more of the traits I admire among my friends in Yunnan-a warm view of hospitality , a greater appreciation of natural surroundings , a resilience to ill fortune and calamities beyond one 's control and more inclination to enjoy to the fullest the good times that inevitably follow .  
Recently another incident was big news : a Maori activist was caught trying to cut down the Monterey pine on One Tree Hill , which was planted last century by British settlers . The New Zealand government spent over NZ $ 10,000 to save the tree , but the Maori finally received a suspended sentence because the court was understanding of his feelings about history .  
Most readers will have at least a sketchy understanding of the story that followed : Bo Yang was thrown into jail on charges of " stirring up trouble between the government and the people . " For nearly ten years , people were n't sure if he was dead or alive , and Taiwan 's society was that much more hushed without him . Yet the people 's passion for freedom and democracy had not been extinguished .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
He avers that married couples have been through a long process of falling in love , marriage , and living together , which provides a foundation of emotional attachment and understanding . When divorce becomes inevitable , the two people have already been through repeated internal struggles .  
Jan Jyh-horng responded that although Taipei has never sought to avoid political negotiations aimed at eventual reunification , both Beijing and Taipei would first have to approach such negotiations with a common understanding that " the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by separate and equal entities . "  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
Recently , at the invitation of Taipei City Government , Morris Chang , chairman of the powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) , delivered a lecture entitled " New Recruits for the 21st Century . " The specification he described for modern employees included these requirements : The ability to actively participate in political and social work ; an international perspective ; taking pleasure in cooperative endeavor ; a good general understanding of science and technology ; and the ability to think independently . Finally , they should be " specialized all-rounders . "  
In his autobiography , Chang reveals that the key period which shaped his life was the year he spent at Harvard at age 18 . Compulsory courses there included an extensive review of the Western classics , and this not only allowed him to become familiar with the development of Western culture , but also laid down the foundations of his understanding of the humanities .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
As for how serious the situation should become before closing schools , Chen Chien-jen , a professor at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology at NTU 's School of Public Health , pointed out that judgment about the seriousness of an outbreak requires an objective decision based on an understanding of the communicability of a disease , the number and density of people who are infected , and the rate of secondary infection , as well as other epidemiological data , and should not be based on a subjective considerations .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Tsai Shu-ying , a math instructor at the Taipei Municipal Teachers ' College , points out that when she teaches elementary and junior high school students who are confused about fractions , instead of overemphasizing the textbook , she uses cup measurements or a ruler and rope so that students can " play " with the concept of proportion . Then she uses jigsaw puzzles that have been colored one color so as to give students an understanding of the principles behind mathematical operations .
