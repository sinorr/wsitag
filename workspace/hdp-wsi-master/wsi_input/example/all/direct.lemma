Its volume of foreign trade and exports is close to that of Russia and the inflow of direct foreign investment exceeds that of Brazil , which ranks sixth in the world .  It is thus in a fairly strong position to take part in international economic competition .

If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
Leaders at all levels should study hard more new and high-tech knowledge to improve their scientific and technical qualifications , should conduct deep and satisfactory investigation and studies and modestly listen to opinions from experts and personnel involved in science and technology .

Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .

As a vice president and the chief designer of China 's Research Institute of Air-to-Air Missiles , he took charge of and gave direct leadership to scientific and technological personnel designing and finalizing many types of air-to-air missiles , thus making the our country 's research and development of air-to-air missiles climb onto one new stage after another from starting from scratch to copying and self-designing and until reaching the international advanced level .  
A certain unit in the navy has actively explored adapting to the new path of future warfare , characterized by rapid and cross-territory emergency support logistics , realizing the two great leaps of changing from the one type of solitary missile support unit of the past to multiple series and multiple types of missile support , and from transferring missiles from reserves for support into direct provision of real-fire missile support to operational troops .

The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
You Dexin emphasized that the motherland of Mainland China upholds several fundamental principles for the development of cross-strait economic relations : " direct and two-way , reciprocal and mutually beneficial , diverse , stable and long-term and adhering to agreements .

If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
A Communist China official confirmed that since 18 March last year , Chang Yung-fa , who is an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian , had been unable to visit the mainland due to political reason .

Therefore , to ensure that our contingent of army cadres is on the mark politically is the top priority for upholding the principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the army , which has a direct bearing on the prosperity or decline and success or failure of the party 's cause , the prolonged peace and stability of the country , and the overall requirement that the army is " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .  There is a universal call from various social circles on the Taiwan authorities to abandon the " Taiwan independence " ideology , stop political in-fighting , improve cross-strait relations , open three direct links [ postal , commercial , and air and shipping links ] , and concentrate on revitalizing the economy .  
The new Taiwan leader inherited Li Denghui 's " Taiwan independence " line , negated the " 1992 consensus , " insisted on continuing the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy , set up barriers to the opening of direct " three exchanges " across the strait , openly asserted that " unification is not the only option , " and perused money diplomacy to expand their " international space .

Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .  Esteem and love for him well up in our hearts as we recall the historic and outstanding contributions he had made to the smooth handover of Hong Kong and Macao and the efforts he made in laying the foundation for long-term stability and prosperity .  
Currently it is necessary to pay great attention to several conspicuous problems that have a direct bearing on the immediate interests of the broad masses of the people , have provoked a strong reaction from the masses , and have caused serious harm to society .

The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Meanwhile , various social circles also proposed ways to shake off Taiwan 's economic predicament , and urged the authorities to discard their " no haste , be patient " policy , and to open up the direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links at an early date .  They hope : The urgent problems of enhancing Taiwan 's economic development can be resolved through cross-strait exchanges and cooperation .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
He does not recognize the one China principle , and negates the 1992 ARATS-Strait Exchange Foundation consensus on each side of the strait interpreting in oral form its " adherence to the one China principle " ; he has continued to practice the policy of " no haste , be patient , " blocked direct cross-strait " three links , " pushed " Taiwan cultural independence , " stepped up expansion of armaments and buying arms from abroad , and carried out activities to split the motherland in the international arena .  
In an exclusive interview by these reporters , he said : " Cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation are absolutely complementary and mutually beneficial , the policy of ' overcoming impetuosity and exercising patience ' has not stopped Taiwan businessmen from investing in the mainland , and delaying the ' direct links between the two sides for postal , trade , and air and shipping services ' is meaningless " .  
China and APEC members have maintained very close economic and trade relations for a long time , with the absolute value of trade growing year after year .  The proportion of China 's total foreign trade volume with APEC members has always been maintained at 70 percent or higher , and the proportion of direct investment from APEC members in China 's total volume of foreign investment has all along been maintained at 60 percent or higher .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
Last year industrial enterprises owned by the state and those in which the state held a dominant stake of shares registered a profit exceeding the preceding year by 137.7-billion yuan .  According to estimates , 48 percent of this increase in profit was attributable to the improvement of the macroeconomic environment , and 23 percent was due to the direct effects of the policies adopted by the government to enable the enterprises to stop losses and earn profits .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
Of the big three links , only the issue of direct air links has remained unsettled .  If the government is anxious to see the big three links coming into force , the Mainland Affairs Council should handle this issue in accordance with the Hong Kong mode , namely , authorizing an unofficial representative from the civil aviation sector to sign an agreement with the mainland side .  
The course of development of cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation has proved that the economies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are highly complementary .  The vigorous development of economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and early effectuation of comprehensive , direct " three links " between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait conform to objective economic laws , are in the common interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , and are an inevitable trend in the development of cross-strait relations .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .

The cumulative total of actual utilization of direct investment by foreign companies now exceeds $ 360-billion , and China has ranked first in the world in bringing in foreign investment for eight successive years .  This has played an irreplaceable role in making full use of " two markets and two kinds of resources , " leading forward national economic growth , speeding up industrial restructuring and the progress of science and technology , and impelling the reforms of the economic structure and the marketization process .  
In the face of the worst flood since the founding of New China , leading members of the Guangxi regional party committee and the regional government personally went to the front line to direct the work of combating the flood .

After overcoming various kinds of difficulties , they built more than 10 kilometers of auxiliary dikes within two days .  
With the direct concern shown and efforts made by the heads of state of the two countries , exchange of high-level visits between China and Russia has been frequent , and the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , science and technological , cultural , educational , and other fields has continued to develop , and the results have been notable .  
The US ground force has deemed it imperative to build mobile command centers , ensure rapid and long-range mobilization , handle a huge amount of transmitted information , introduce highly efficient planning procedures , and re-divide work between human beings and machines , so that staff offices will mainly perform direct calculations on software while commanding officers and staff officers will mainly handle a dynamic situation a machine can not . 
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
Government departments must concentrate their energy in doing well macroeconomic control and creating a fine market environment .  In accordance with the demands of government operations laws and economic development laws , we must adjust the direct intervention of government in economic activities , changing the scope of this involvement to a more rational level , such as primarily organizing the production of public goods , developing public benefit undertakings , and providing public services .  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
1 .  To coordinate the process of joining the WTO , Taiwan should decontrol direct cross-strait trade and direct postal and telecommunications services , and , considering the Mainland 's moves to lower its trade barriers , appropriately increase and open up Mainland imports .  Meanwhile , Taiwan should also plan to set up an " early warning system governing cross-strait trade security " to take charge of affairs relevant to national security and industrial risks .  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
Principal leader of local governments should bear primary responsibility for industrial safety .  Those bearing direct administrative responsibility for serious industrial accidents should be punished .  Second , the industrial safety management and supervision institutions should be strengthened .  
Taiwan 's economic growth rate for the second quarter of 2001 was minus 2.35 percent , Taiwan 's economic growth rate for 2001 will be a negative figure for the first time , and Taiwan people have been complaining everywhere .  It fully showed : Taiwan authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has been extremely unpopular and come to a dead end .  If they still refuse to loosen their restrictions and facilitate the three cross-strait direct links as soon as possible , Taiwan 's economy will face an even greater disaster .  
Zhang Deguang said , as a result of more than 10 years of accumulated experience , China and Russia have built a whole set of effective mechanisms for developing good neighborliness , friendship , and strategic coordination , from the periodic meetings of their heads of state and heads of government to bilateral direct contacts between counterpart departments .  These mechanisms involve various fields such as politics , economics , and science and technology , and they are being more and more perfected and standardized .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
The average annual indirect income should come to 150 to 200 billion yuan if calculated according to a ratio of one-to-two to three ( a conservative estimate ) between direct incomes from civil aviation and the indirect incomes ( tourist , insurance , and postal earnings for instance ) .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
This vast strategy geared to the new century will not only help to attain common prosperity , strengthen the unity of nationalities , and maintain social stability and border tranquillity , and help to expand domestic demand , open up markets , and provide a new support force for economic development , but will also have a direct bearing on whether the goal of the third step in China 's modernization strategy ( to reach the standard of a medium , developed country by mid-century ) can be attained .  
A short time ago , the Legislative Council members of the " democratic factions " proposed a motion to " revise the Basic Law , " demanding that all the members of the Legislative Council be elected through direct voting ahead of schedule , and that the chief executive of the HKSAR be directly elected by way of " one man one vote . "

"  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
It is conceivable that the series of matters on international human rights that were given assurance in Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech will surely bring forth unprecedented warm relations between them and international anti-China forces and human rights organizations , and lead to international human rights organization conducting activities in Taiwan " legally , " thereby winning direct and indirectly new support and protection for " Taiwan independence . "  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
they proclaim that they take the popular will as the guide in everything , yet turn a deaf ear to and set aside the strong aspirations of the Taiwan compatriots in demanding direct cross-strait flights , putting into effect the " three links , " and changing the policy of " no haste , be patient . "  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
With regard to the attempt of the United States to deploy its advanced TMD [ theatre missile defense ] in northeast Asia in the course of developing its NMD , Sha Zukang pointed out that this has constituted a direct threat to the effectiveness of China 's existing limited nuclear force .  
It is learned that the ARATS and the New Party have discussed and reached consensus on some important issues concerning current relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , including upholding the one-China principle , opposing " Taiwan independence , " promoting direct " links in trade , transportation and postal services " and developing economic cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
After joining the WTO and gradually opening up its domestic financial markets , what China will be faced with will be a direct confrontation between the strength of the international and domestic markets , and the primary responsibility of the State Administration of Exchange Control will be to read market signals and rely on modern financial programs and methods to dispel and crack down on various speculative activities promptly , upholding orderly and legitimate market competition and safeguarding the economic and financial security of the state .  
With regard to building a rapid reaction mechanism for the market , we should make efforts to counter speculation in the foreign exchange realm our starting point , because once we join the WTO , the foreign currency management departments will of course have to employ after-the-fact inspections to uncover illegal activity in the foreign exchange realm and crack down on it sharply , but the more important thing will be the direct and preemptive disruption of speculative offensive behavior targeting China 's financial markets .  
People are convinced that , under the direct push by the leaders of the two countries and with joint efforts of both sides , the strategic cooperation partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] between China and Russia will certainly be further strengthened , and the economic cooperation between the two countries will continue to develop in a stable manner .  
We must exert great efforts to standardize the government procurement procedure and make direct payments from the state treasury .  It is necessary to make the procurement procedure open , standardized , fair , and transparent so as to solve the problems that exist right now such as decentralized procurement , redundant procurement , blind procurement , and receiving kickbacks , and so on .  We must crack down on corruptive practices , while reducing expenditures .  
Luo Gan said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very much concerned about Xinjiang 's economic development and social and political stability .  The task of maintaining Xinjiang 's social and political stability is arduous so I hope that Xinjiang 's judicial organs , under direct leadership of the regional party committee and government , will further seek consensus , strengthen cooperation , duly focus attention on the drive to improve social order , and carry out other special struggles .  
Within a short time , Xinhuanet , which was comprehensively revised recently , has attracted widespread attention from all sectors of society with its authoritative and rich information , views that sweep down irresistibly from a commanding height , and in-depth reports that have a direct grip on major social issues .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
Today 's video and telephone conference emphasized that from now on , the industrial and commercial administration departments at all levels should keep a tight control on the issue of licenses and turn down all applications from units and individuals who are actually involved in illegal MLM and disguised MLM activities in the name of sole distribution , agency marketing , authorized partnership , direct marketing , chain marketing , or network marketing .  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
The leaders in charge of the public security and judicial work and the comprehensive management of public security , as the direct responsible person for maintaining social stability , should actively organize and coordinate the relevant departments , clearly divide up the work and define responsibility , pool efforts to do the work together , and promote a smooth investigation and mediation of contradictions and disputes .  
Commenting on the issues of direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links [ hereafter termed as the " three links " ] during a meeting with a Taiwan Lien-Ho Pao delegation in Beijing in late August , Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , pointed out : So long as Taiwan authorities acknowledge that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , relevant concrete problems can be easily resolved .  
To resolve the " three-link " issues , if both sides jointly recognize that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , both sides could simplify relevant provisions as much as possible .  Both sides definitely could refer and use the provisions governing direct experimental shipping between Fuzhou and Kaohsiung and between Xiamen and Kaohsiung . Thus , a lot of troubles can be avoided and sensitive issues can be easily resolved .  
After the explosion occurred , relevant leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Urumqi City promptly went to the scene of the explosion to direct rescue operations .  Several hundred public security personnel , armed police , and military personnel stationed in the area as well as more than 100 medical personnel swiftly plunged into fire fighting and rescue work .  The injured people were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment .  
He said that in order to replace direct and specific management with macroscopic and strategic guidance , the important thing is to create a fine policy and legal environment for the healthy growth and functioning of professional and technical personnel and to establish and perfect a mechanism which allows outstanding personnel to excel .  
and the East Asian countries have practiced a series of more favorable and open policies to attract foreign capital in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the Asian financial crisis .  In 1999 , the direct foreign investment in the Republic of Korea grew by 75.6 percent over the previous year , which is also an important factor leading to the decline of foreign capital flowing into China .  
Article 19 .  For those who violate the regulations in these measures by providing unlicensed commercial ISS , or by providing other services than those prescribed in their licenses , the telecommunications administrations of the provinces , autonomous regions , or municipalities under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction shall order them to mend their ways within a specified period , confiscate their illegal incomes , and impose on them a fine between three and five times of their illegal incomes .  
based on the principle " equality and mutual benefit , variety of forms , attention to practical results , and joint development , " China will adopt tangible measures to greatly step up Sino-African economic and trade and social development cooperation , and continually expand the spheres and channels of cooperation ; in particular , it will encourage direct links and exchanges between Chinese and African enterprises , so that the enterprises can play a still greater role in bilateral cooperation .  
At the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , continued management was given to the serious inflation problem , and an economic soft landing was achieved .  In the middle of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , given the trend toward deflation , a policy of monetary stabilization was implemented , moving from the use of primarily direct control toward using methods of indirect financial control ;  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
Vice Defense Minister Sun T'ao-yu said if the three mini direct links are established without cross-strait negotiation or without comprehensive control measures and other measures , some people from the mainland indeed may come to collect intelligence under the pretext of coming to Kinmen and Matsu for sightseeing or doing business and that will be harmful to our national defense .  
Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .  The success or failure of leading enterprises has a direct bearing on our work to improve the economic efficiency of agriculture , to increase the income of our peasants , and to maintain the stability of rural areas .  
Various signs have indicated that the no haste , be patient policy will not be relaxed in the near future even if the government is willing to establish three direct cross-strait links [ direct trade , mail and transport links ] or the three mini direct links , because crucial decision-makers of the new government have taken an " unshakable " stand toward the no haste , be patient policy .  This has also determined why the repeated motions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on relaxing the policy were turned down .  
Beijing is worried that Taiwan and the US would take this opportunity to resume their military cooperation which has been suspended since 1979 .  Recently , signs showing this have surfaced unceasingly .  The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act clearly stipulates that the US military headquarters in the Pacific should have " direct and confidential communications " with the Taiwan military .  In mid-December , Taiwan 's request of buying Aegis-class destroyers from the US was proposed again , and will be decided at the China-US meeting scheduled to be held in April next year .  
Leaders of the party and state have repeatedly reiterated sticking to the basic guideline of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and President Jiang 's eight proposals , continued to vigorously develop cross-strait economic cooperation , pushed for direct " three links " across the strait at an early date , and welcomed visits by Taiwan parties , bodies , and people of all circles to exchange views and promote consensus on opposing together " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait ties , and promoting the process of peaceful reunification .  
At the National Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Work Conference held in Beijing today , Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said that the anticipated objective of China 's total import and export amount for 2005 will be $ 650 billion , and that the scale of foreign direct investment absorbed in the next five years will remain at an average of $ 40 billion a year .  
At the same time as this , the new authorities ignored the requests of the widespread public in Taiwan for easing up , improvement and development of cross-strait relations , and ignored the urgent requests of numerous industrial and business circles to quicken cross-strait economic interchanges and cooperation .  They still obstinately insisted on Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] " no haste , be patient " policy , saying one thing about cross-strait direct " three links " and meaning another , completely lacking sincerity .  
An Min pointed out : For a long time , Taiwan authorities have rejected direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait and adopted a series of obstructive and restrictive policies .  This is out of keeping with the basic demands of the people on both sides of the strait and the development of the situation , and has infringed upon the fundamental interests of the people on both shores , especially the Taiwan people .  This practice is increasingly unpopular .  
In 1986 , our ministry announced management measures , and in 1993 our ministry in conjunction with the General Customs Administration promulgated the " Management Measures for Small-Volume Trade with the Taiwan Region . " Small-volume trade is conducted by approved small-volume trade companies under the supervision of Customs and is supplementary to the regular trade across the strait .  Its existence and development has advanced the understanding of the people on both sides of the strait and has played a positive role in encouraging direct trade across the strait .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Qian Qichen said , back in 1979 , based on the objective requirements of cross-strait economic development and exchanges of various kinds , we proposed the establishment of direct postal , transport , and commercial links across the strait .  It is regrettable that this has not yet been realized due to the obstacles raised by the Taiwan authorities .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Shortly after the Taiwan authorities started their so-called " mini three links , " the Kuomintang and the New Party separately dispatched their " three links " delegations to visit Beijing and expressed their discontent at the Taiwan authorities ' dilatory and perfunctory practice toward the " three links . "  This also shows that only complete and direct " three links " can really satisfy the urgent needs of the people on both sides of the strait .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .  
The relevant responsible persons of the provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities under direct central jurisdiction , cities with separate plans , some quasi-provincial level provincial capitals , and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps as well as responsible persons of the relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also attended the conference .  
He stressed the need to further promote the development of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges , promote the realization of direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date , and the need to seriously listen to the voice of Taiwan compatriots , increase exchanges with all political parties , organizations , and people in Taiwan who oppose division and support national reunification , and jointly make efforts to promote the development of cross-strait relations and realize the motherland 's complete reunification .  
Wan added that he was glad to see some Taiwan political parties and organizations visited and established ties with the mainland one after another ; industrial and commercial enterprises successively broke the restriction of " no haste , be patient " and made investments in the mainland ; there are mounting calls in Taiwan for direct " three links " ; and the anti - " independence " and pro-reunification forces have been growing .  The motherland 's reunification has become the focus of attention of the Chinese from around the world .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
On Sunday morning , Xiancheng Town in Guangdong 's Chaoyang City experienced a disturbance caused by more than 1,000 elementary school pupils .  As disclosed by the local police to this newspaper last night , during the disturbance , the office building of this town government was burned , and some windows and appliances were smashed .  The direct reason was that the township and town authorities began collecting additional education surcharge from the newly admitted pupils , thus arousing complaints among some students and their parents .  
As disclosed , the reason why the Shenyang people 's deputies were dissatisfied with the city court and city procuratorate 's reports was that this city has in recent years seen a series of shocking cases - - including party and government officials ' corruption cases , major cases involving criminal syndicates , and shooting cases - - some of which even bothered Zhongnanhai and required the central authorities ' direct intervention in the investigation and handling .  
In light of the principle of " uniting , educating , and saving the majority and following the law to attack the tiny minority , " the Ningxia party committee and government established the system of party and government chiefs holding overall responsibility and the leaders at each level assuming direct responsibility .  The regional party committee and government also assigned responsibility to the leading cadres at all levels .  Whoever slackens the work of transformation through supervision and education should be held responsible for negligence .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
carried out the pragmatic policies of " turning croplands back into woodlands ( or grasslands ) , closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation , giving the local people grain supply instead of outright grant , and signing preservation contracts with individual households .  Now a total of 188 counties in 17 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction have returned the grain plots to forestry or grassland .  
From 1996 to 2000 , China took in direct foreign investment in the amount of $ 2134.8 billion ( amount actually received ) , an 87 percent increase in comparison to the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " , while the annual average of foreign capital taken in held steady at more than US $ 40 billion .

A high-speed ferry service operating between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Chek Lap Kok Ferry Pier was introduced to meet passenger demand .  
In the course of treatment , some clinical staff may commit errors due to factors related to experience , professional judgement and personal or other environmental reasons .  As a result , the patients concerned may not be able to receive proper treatment .  The occurrence of these isolated mistakes can not be construed to indicate that all our frontline clinical staff lack alertness or the sense of accountability , and neither does this have any direct relation with the strength of frontline manpower resources .  
There was a direct correlation between the level of air pollution and admissions to hospital for respiratory illness which led to a loss of productivity ; a loss of intellectual capital as sick children miss part of their schooling ; the social cost of the elderly requiring greater care and attention and the effect of dirty air in putting off tourists or potential business migrants .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
Every day , 4,000 tonnes of waste paper are produced .  About 2,000 tonnes are either part of domestic waste and go straight to landfills , mostly through USD and RSD collection services , or are of poor quality or contaminated commercial waste that the collectors again take direct to the landfills or refuse transfer stations .  
The Government has already allocated a very substantial proportion of public funds to the welfare sector on an annual basis , in terms of capital and recurrent resources .  In the financial year 1999 / 2000 , the subvention for direct services will rise to $ 6.2 billion from $ 5.4 billion .

Ltd . and the Hong Kong Telecom , to enable local and overseas philatelists to make direct purchase of postal products and souvenirs under a reliable and secure Internet environment .  
During the interviews , the enumerators noticed that respondents felt embarrassed and uneasy or held a perfunctory attitude when being asked questions related to this topic .  Thus the number of " children born out of registered marriage " established via the " direct questioning method " can not be relied on .

This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
Regarding the proposals of the Education Commission to allocate 85 per cent of Primary One places on the principle of " vicinity " and to encourage primary and secondary schools to link among themselves to facilitate direct admission of Primary Six students to the linked secondary schools , there are comments that such proposals will result in more parents giving false residential addresses or moving to districts which fall within the school nets of their preferred schools so as to enhance the chance of their children being admitted to those schools .

The net outflow of financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by a net outflow in direct investment due to increased investment by Hong Kong residents abroad , a shift to net outflow due to cash settlement of financial derivatives , and a continued though reduced net outflow in other investment , but a continued huge net inflow in portfolio investment .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 66.7 billion and $ 65.3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 over the preceding quarter , reflecting the much improved regional and local investment situation upon the economic revival .

In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .

Mr Passow continued , " The criteria for all awards was based on conversations by the editorial staff with consultants from the major accounting and financial service firms who monitor direct international investment flows and the tracking by Euromoney 's editorial staff of public information on the dollar amounts of deals in the Asia Pacific area .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
" RSV is a common cause of respiratory tract infection worldwide .  It is spread by direct contact with infectious secretions , or droplets spread indirectly through contaminated hands , eating utensils , or articles freshly soiled by nasal discharge of the infected person .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
Pastor Chou pointed out that the free translation , adoption of special literary styles such as parallelism , and the elimination of conjunctions as far as possible , have allowed the true meaning of the Bible 's religious terminology and idioms to be preserved . The manipulation of punctuation marks , verbs and direct and indirect quotations , have also helped to make the modern Chinese Bible more colloquial , simple , graceful and beautiful .  
But the concern today is that among the competing claims of salon , nature , conceptual , documentary , and other schools , photographers may become lost between empty formalism and blind conceptualism and that the basic nature of photography may be forgotten - - the pure , direct , and honest observation and recording of reality .  
The majority of Ch'en Keng-pin 's photos are of natural scenery , where his employment of crystal-clear priorities and a delicate , quality feel took the place of the typically obscure , artificial beautification of other photographers . These attributes provided a more direct and powerful expression to the essential face of his photography .  
Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
The US stands in sharp contrast to Japan , respecting the individual , pursuing happiness , favoring direct expression . Because of its vast size , attention is focussed on domestic matters , and there is a common lack of understanding of the outside world .  
With an educational credit system inherited from Europe , Australian universities used to recognize degrees from Taiwan from only a few public universities as qualifying their holders for direct admission to graduate school , but they have gradually relaxed their standards . Only a few , such as Sydney and Melbourne , are more strict and may require an oral interview or a trial year in the undergraduate program before deciding on admission .  
" Even so , seventy performances in a hundred-seat venue only amounts to a total audience of 7,000 , " says Li , running off figures fast and precise , Woody Allen fashion . " When direct and indirect production costs for the play are taken into account , including auditorium rental and personnel overneads , we are talking about a net loss of NT $ 150,000 . " What then would satisfy him ?  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
Maintain Flexibility : Big corporations invest not only in real estate , they also invest in the restaurant , dry goods , and gift industries , consequently merging several stores to become a largescale shopping center . Restaurants have also become beautifully decorated with service provided by equally well adorned girls . This is a direct challenge to established enterprises . "  
In " An Open Letter to Our Compatriots on Taiwan , " delivered in 1979 before the National People 's Congress by standing central committee member Ye Jianying , the Communists declared that they would cease shelling Kinmen , Matsu and other offshore islands and would set up navigation and postal links as soon as possible to facilitate direct contacts between the two sides and carry out acade mic and cultural exchange .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Making a choice for the childQ : After Chi An became pregnant with her second child in the United States , she was unwilling to have an abortion there , and she was afraid that when she returned to mainland China she would be forced to abort . With your help , she received political asylum and stayed in the US . In fact , she never incurred any direct oppression . Why was her application successful ?  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative . And they are no different from conventional books - - they can be divided into ones which merely stimulate the senses , and ones which contain deep thought .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
Lin Yu-ping went the island to observe the troupe . Liu says that upon striking the drum , the whole wooden classroom resonated as if the room itself had been struck . The resultant sound , he recounts , can not be described as music , nor as rhythm , but rather as a direct assault upon one 's body , which " awakens your entire being . " The visitor is quite shaken by the experience .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
If the star is successful , the program pays for the person 's desired prize ; otherwise , the person 's hope is left unrealized . The format of this segment resembles the old show Loving Heart , which encouraged people to help some unfortunate . But the new program has an even more direct emotional appeal insofar as it cuts in live shots of the reactions of the hosts and audience members , sometimes zooming in on the superstar celebrities as they weep .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
The Executive Yuan news website , established by the Government Information Office ( GIO ) , was formally launched in August . This new website , designed as a part of the drive for " electronic , Internet-wired government , " is the Executive Yuan 's own dedicated news operation , providing audio-visual real-time news , along with information on policies and measures of the Executive Yuan . The site also takes advantage of the Net 's rapid interactive capability to give the public a direct channel of communication with the Executive Yuan .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
He is especially appreciative of the way older folks take care of their gongs . In a temple parade , direct exposure to the hot sun can get a gong too hot and foul up its sound . When this happens , the old folks will wipe a gong with a wet cloth and wait for it to cool before striking it .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance . Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities , and shall refrain from recruiting any such person into their armed forces .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
In 1996 , the ROC 's first direct presidential election marked the first time ever that Chinese people could select their own leader on a one-man , one-vote basis . But it was also when cross-strait relations reached their nadir , as the mainland undertook missile tests prior to the election , creating extreme tension . The resulting freeze in political relations created circumstances under which any national leader of Taiwan would have to make national security the top priority .  
In 1996 Chou read an article about oceanographic research in which the writer , inspired by everyday experience , described how even in a closed room with no direct light source , scattered sunlight ( " ambient light " ) entering the room and striking objects is reflected into people 's eyes to form images , so that people in the room can still see each other .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
Wu Hsiao-ming , a doctoral candidate in international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai , assumed when he entered in 1997 that it would n't be long before direct travel would be possible between the two sides . Five years have passed and the prospect of direct travel is still remote . Many students likewise thought that the government would recognize mainland degrees by the time they finished their programs , and that everything would be smooth sailing thereafter , but this idea has proved far removed from reality .  
The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
Wu Huang , deputy secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , explains further : " Precisely because the range of renewable energies is so diverse , each country has to direct its limited resources toward the development of selected areas in which it has an advantage . Thus Germany is developing wind power and Japan hydroelectric power . In Taiwan we hope to achieve a balanced development of hydro , wind , geothermal , biomass and photovoltaic energy sources . "  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
In the area of investment , there was already a growing pattern of investment among developing countries However , virtually all private direct foreign investment in the developing world had been concentrated on a short list of middle income countries  
CFIIT is the sole national economic and trade activity devoted to foreign direct investment attraction In the past three sessions , contracts for 6,708 investment and cooperation projects were signed with a total foreign investment of 37-249-billion US dollars , with the import and export trade volume amounting to 2 968 billion US dollars  
Non governmental exchanges will help establish direct links between cultural groups of the two sides who have common interests However , he added , ethnic characteristics in various cultures must be preserved during the process of developing friendly relationship  
China and the US have common interests in trade , with the US being the third largest direct investor in the Chinese economy , after Hong Kong and Taiwan Its market presently absorbs about five per cent of China 's total gross domestic products , with bilateral trade extremely large and growing at a substantial pace  
The international community 's commitment to sustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced by encouraging increased direct foreign investment , as well as an increased international transfer of financial resources to the region .  
In that context , the Council requested the " Secretary-General to direct urgent preparation of a detailed plan with concrete steps setting out UNOSOM II 's future concerted strategy with regard to its humanitarian , political and security activities " .  
They recalled the two mutually supporting forms of action by CSCE : those joint political decisions taken in accordance with consensus rules and direct action through agreed mechanisms activated by a limited number of participating States .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
A number of delegations addressed the issue of the continued growth of foreign direct investment in the world economy in the context of expected recovery in world economic performance and growth and continuing structural changes in the world economy .  
To the extent that foreign direct investment frameworks became similar , other factors assumed great significance ; these included appropriate legal framework good governance , and a stable political and sound macroeconomic environment .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
The study reviewed recent trends in women 's educational status in developing countries and updated existing evidence on the direct and indirect linkages between education and reproductive behaviour , marriage and desired family size .  
Political , regulatory , investment , fiscal , environmental and monetary issues have emerged as significant in encouraging direct foreign investment in mineral exploration .  
An effective method of isolating and eliminating these sources of violence should be accompanied by strict implementation of the peace agreements , especially those which have a direct and indirect impact on the situation of human rights or common violence .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
A number of seminars and discussion forums intended for large audiences were organized , aiming to enhance popular understanding of foreign direct investment , its developmental potential , and the relevant policy issues .  
In these circumstances , the Russianspeaking population of Latvia is becoming an easy target for radical nationalist bureaucrats performing arbitrary and lawless acts with the secret but , in fact , direct connivance of the political leadership .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
Promotion of access to land and security of tenure for all urban residents , in particular the poor , through improved land market transparency and innovative mechanisms to utilize public and private land , including fiscal incentives to bring unutilized land into use , improved land-delivery and land-tenure systems and , where appropriate , direct government and municipal landownership ;  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
The difficulties besetting African countries are still present : the crushing burden of external debt , the steady deterioration of the terms of trade , the scant inflow of resources and direct foreign investment and the continued degradation of the environment because of the growing , interrelated pressures of the population and poverty .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
Sometimes this means that certain conflicts whose threat to international stability is not obvious swallow up considerable funds , with large contingents of peace-keeping forces being sent immediately , whereas in other instances we believe the Security Council is slow to act , sometimes taking months to study a situation and limiting itself in the final analysis to sending small groups of observers , despite the direct request made by the leaders of the States concerned .  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
Few impediments to progress are more implacable and emotional than that of Israeli settlers who both remain in and continue to settle the occupied territories , and that this could be supported by the Israeli Government in full knowledge of the ultimate and unavoidable consequences is difficult to believe when there is plainly a direct correlation between the violence in the occupied territories and the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .  
In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .  
Established in 1988 , the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) promotes foreign direct investment for economic and social development in borrowing member countries by guaranteeing investments against political risks , helping countries to create an attractive investment climate and providing promotional and advisory services .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .

On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
Seminars and workshops on the functions and impact of international , regional and bilateral arrangements ; country experience studies ; harmonization of foreign direct investment reporting systems ; incorporation of sustainable development management practices into national policies ; and enhancement of national strategies for sustainable development as they relate to transnational corporations .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
A prior requirement , however , would be the removal by individual countries of the range of impediments that currently limit intraregional capital flows , including foreign-exchange controls , legislation and regulations , that discriminate against foreign investors , restrictions on transfers and other direct and indirect measures designed to influence capital flows .  
The UNV programme has consistently sought to promote participatory processes by using appropriate volunteer modalities , including mixed teams of international and national personnel , and by creating direct linkages between UNV specialists and local populations .  
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .  
They concluded that additional staffing was essential to provide the level of management services required for the investment of assets as large as those of UNJSPF , to sustain the global network of direct custodial relationships which have been established , and to enhance the investment decision-making process .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
In the statement , the Ministers asserted , inter alia , that , by virtue of the geographical situation of their countries , the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) had caused significant direct and indirect losses to their economies , and that the burden of the sanctions was exceeding the reasonable point of economic and social tolerance .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
In particular , the main purposes of the Decade were lost among initiatives of limited scope or proposals to establish direct communication links between the United Nations system and indigenous communities , without due regard to the legitimate role of national Governments as the appropriate channel for international cooperation .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Another institution with a direct bearing on the process of reconstruction and improving the living conditions of poor groups is the Social Investment Fund , which channels assistance to poor sectors of the population , including those uprooted by the conflict , thereby meeting the dual objective of combating poverty and strengthening the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .  
The bands of Taliban , under the direct control of the Pakistani Government , recently gathered at the outskirts of the capital Kabul and suffered repeated setbacks as a result of the crushing blows by the forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , thus falling short of their heinous plans of taking over the city of Kabul .  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .

Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
flow of men and mat ï¿½ï¿½ iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
Efforts to perfect Cuba 's political system and the rule of law had included the strengthening of constitutional rights and the enactment of a new election law providing for free , direct and secret parliamentary elections for the direct , popular nomination of candidates , without any need for political affiliation or party membership .  
Above and beyond the creation of a dense industrial network , the direct involvement of the State in economic management has made it possible for us to take on the considerable and manifold needs of a population deprived of essentials in the areas of education , health , jobs and housing and to set up an infrastructure even in the remotest corners of our vast territory .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
We note with interest that Germany , a nation widely regarded as a potential direct beneficiary of an increase in permanent membership , put forward the idea that new permanent members should not be eternal but subject to periodic review with a 15-year interval in the form of a General Assembly vote .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
It should be marked by a constant , unfailing mobilization of efforts to dismantle the criminal chain of terrorism , including those who are perpetrators , those who are behind them , the various political networks and their sources of financing and supply , and the direct or indirect logistical support given by individuals , groups or States .  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Multiple frameworks generate confusion at both political and administrative levels about which frameworks prevail over others ; often compete for the small pool of highly qualified national personnel available to direct and implement the planning exercises ; and raise expectations about sectoral planning that are not achievable except through persistent commitment at the national and international levels . 
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
Within [ a ] [ the ] stated period [ of one / two years ] after separation from public service , public officials holding managerial positions shall , within the framework of national law , obtain governmental permission prior to accepting employment or consultancy assignments from business or private concerns that are in [ direct ] financial relationship with the governmental department or agency in which such officials were employed .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
Noticing that the 14-million eligible voters among the 21.3-million Republic of China citizens living in Taiwan , Penghu ( Pescadores ) , Kinmen ( Quemoy ) and Matsu area have , through universal , equal and direct suffrage and secret balloting , elected their first popularly elected president on 23 March 1996 as their genuine representative in the international community ,  
There has been substantial progress in the establishment of a physical planning unit to direct natural resource management and in the preparation of an environmental profile of the island and an inventory of its historical , archaeological , cultural and natural resources .

Other countries like Benin , Ethiopia and Senegal , which experienced a severe decline in foreign direct investment during the previous decade , have managed to arrest and even reverse this trend as a result of reforms and with the advent of an encouraging economic outlook .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
The general conclusion is that timber export taxes and bans have proved only moderately successful in achieving the desired results in South-east Asia , and in many cases they were achieved at high economic cost , in terms of both the direct costs of subsidization and the additional costs of wasteful and inefficient processing operations .  
Cuba considers that the considerable problems with anti-personnel mines experienced by a number of third world countries are due in large part , if we limit ourselves to the most direct causes , to the unscrupulous export policies which have been extensively practised by several developed countries ; these have made substantial profits from such operations and taken little account of the impact on the civilian populations of many countries .  
In principle , estimates should cover both the direct , first round impact of sanctions ( which is evaluated as the income forgone and additional costs incurred , resulting from terminated trade in goods and services and suspended financial transfers ) and the indirect , second round effects such as the reduction of imported inputs following the decline of exports or output .  
They are based on the concept of direct ( impact on the balance of payments ) , indirect and additional losses and include the methods of evaluating losses declared by Bulgarian economic entities , of analysis and simulation of foreign trade with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the country 's balance of payments ( trade in goods and services ) as well as the method of expert analysis by line ministries .  
Its strategy for promoting universal access to basic social services is threefold : ( a ) direct support to service delivery ; ( b ) capacity - building and social mobilization ; and ( c ) advocacy .  UNICEF emphasizes the need to sustain investment in children in good times and in bad , and in times of fiscal restraint and economic liberalization .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
They are , rather , the direct result of a long-term and focused plan of action that took concrete and unmistakable shape following the assumption of power by the new Israeli Government , which is pursuing an aggressive expansionist policy in violation of the agreements concluded by the former Government of Israel .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that voluntary contributions had been received in the amount of $ 12.3-million from the Governments of Canada ( $ 1.7-million ) and the United States of America ( $ 10.6-million ) to provide for all direct and indirect costs of 670 troops , including the standard troop cost reimbursement and allowances , contingent-owned equipment reimbursement , death and disability compensation , rations , fuel , miscellaneous supplies , logistics support services and civilian staff required for administrative purposes , for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1996 .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
As explained in an earlier report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / C . 5 / 49 / 64 , para . 8 ) , the costs of staff representational activities and the staff-management consultative process can be identified as both direct costs against the regular budget and indirect costs in terms of the release of staff from their assigned programme duties .  
Thus , for example , Tunisian women have been encouraged to set up production enterprises in various sectors and have benefited from numerous opportunities giving them access to the highest responsibilities in administrative and decision-making circles , opening up the way for their participation in all consultative bodies dealing with national affairs and the people 's future , and to the fulfilment of their role in a civil society whose basis is the elimination of all forms of direct or indirect exclusion .  
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
In Haiti , although there is no direct technical cooperation related to a specific project , close and regular coordination is maintained at a political level .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .

As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alvaro Ramos , said earlier in the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , the international community must continue to encourage direct dialogue between Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries in order to support mutual recognition and faithfulness to the ultimate objective of a firm and lasting peace in the Middle East .

There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .

The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .

However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .

At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .  There is a universal call from various social circles on the Taiwan authorities to abandon the " Taiwan independence " ideology , stop political in-fighting , improve cross-strait relations , open three direct links [ postal , commercial , and air and shipping links ] , and concentrate on revitalizing the economy .  
The new Taiwan leader inherited Li Denghui 's " Taiwan independence " line , negated the " 1992 consensus , " insisted on continuing the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy , set up barriers to the opening of direct " three exchanges " across the strait , openly asserted that " unification is not the only option , " and perused money diplomacy to expand their " international space . "  He is sliding farther down the road of splitting the country .  
Article 15 .  Following the occurrence of an extraordinarily serious safety incident that has a particularly pernicious social impact , or whose nature is particularly serious , the State Council will mete out disciplinary sanctions against the provincial governor , autonomous region chairman , or mayor of the municipality under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction , and the chief responsible persons of the relevant State Council departments .  
Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .  Esteem and love for him well up in our hearts as we recall the historic and outstanding contributions he had made to the smooth handover of Hong Kong and Macao and the efforts he made in laying the foundation for long-term stability and prosperity .  
Currently it is necessary to pay great attention to several conspicuous problems that have a direct bearing on the immediate interests of the broad masses of the people , have provoked a strong reaction from the masses , and have caused serious harm to society .  Measures to be taken primarily in this respect are : cracking down on the production and sale of counterfeit goods and shoddy goods , with an emphasis on foodstuffs , medicines , agricultural materials , cotton , and assembled vehicles ;  
The US , Japanese , and British forces have all stressed the following two requirements : First , a senior commanding officer shall have received training in various military academies and schools before taking office ; Second , a senior commanding officer shall have served in different posts in different services before taking office .  These two requirements have laid a foundation for a senior commanding officer to direct joint operations .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Meanwhile , various social circles also proposed ways to shake off Taiwan 's economic predicament , and urged the authorities to discard their " no haste , be patient " policy , and to open up the direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links at an early date .  They hope : The urgent problems of enhancing Taiwan 's economic development can be resolved through cross-strait exchanges and cooperation .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
He does not recognize the one China principle , and negates the 1992 ARATS-Strait Exchange Foundation consensus on each side of the strait interpreting in oral form its " adherence to the one China principle " ; he has continued to practice the policy of " no haste , be patient , " blocked direct cross-strait " three links , " pushed " Taiwan cultural independence , " stepped up expansion of armaments and buying arms from abroad , and carried out activities to split the motherland in the international arena .  
In an exclusive interview by these reporters , he said : " Cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation are absolutely complementary and mutually beneficial , the policy of ' overcoming impetuosity and exercising patience ' has not stopped Taiwan businessmen from investing in the mainland , and delaying the ' direct links between the two sides for postal , trade , and air and shipping services ' is meaningless " .  
China and APEC members have maintained very close economic and trade relations for a long time , with the absolute value of trade growing year after year .  The proportion of China 's total foreign trade volume with APEC members has always been maintained at 70 percent or higher , and the proportion of direct investment from APEC members in China 's total volume of foreign investment has all along been maintained at 60 percent or higher .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
Last year industrial enterprises owned by the state and those in which the state held a dominant stake of shares registered a profit exceeding the preceding year by 137.7-billion yuan .  According to estimates , 48 percent of this increase in profit was attributable to the improvement of the macroeconomic environment , and 23 percent was due to the direct effects of the policies adopted by the government to enable the enterprises to stop losses and earn profits .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
Of the big three links , only the issue of direct air links has remained unsettled .  If the government is anxious to see the big three links coming into force , the Mainland Affairs Council should handle this issue in accordance with the Hong Kong mode , namely , authorizing an unofficial representative from the civil aviation sector to sign an agreement with the mainland side .  
The course of development of cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation has proved that the economies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are highly complementary .  The vigorous development of economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and early effectuation of comprehensive , direct " three links " between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait conform to objective economic laws , are in the common interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , and are an inevitable trend in the development of cross-strait relations .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .  As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .  China ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of assimilating foreign direct investment .  
It requires a transformation from sole reliance on administrative measures as in the past , to the comprehensive use of legal , economic , and administrative measures .  It requires a transformation from government control and direct intervention under the planned economic system to guidance services and macro regulation under the market economic system .  It requires a transformation from overstaffed organizations in which there are more people than there is work to do , to streamlined organizations with highly skilled personnel .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The cumulative total of actual utilization of direct investment by foreign companies now exceeds $ 360-billion , and China has ranked first in the world in bringing in foreign investment for eight successive years .  This has played an irreplaceable role in making full use of " two markets and two kinds of resources , " leading forward national economic growth , speeding up industrial restructuring and the progress of science and technology , and impelling the reforms of the economic structure and the marketization process .  
In the face of the worst flood since the founding of New China , leading members of the Guangxi regional party committee and the regional government personally went to the front line to direct the work of combating the flood .  More than 100,000 military servicemen and people have been organized to reinforce the dikes .  After overcoming various kinds of difficulties , they built more than 10 kilometers of auxiliary dikes within two days .  
With the direct concern shown and efforts made by the heads of state of the two countries , exchange of high-level visits between China and Russia has been frequent , and the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , science and technological , cultural , educational , and other fields has continued to develop , and the results have been notable .  
The US ground force has deemed it imperative to build mobile command centers , ensure rapid and long-range mobilization , handle a huge amount of transmitted information , introduce highly efficient planning procedures , and re-divide work between human beings and machines , so that staff offices will mainly perform direct calculations on software while commanding officers and staff officers will mainly handle a dynamic situation a machine can not . 
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
Government departments must concentrate their energy in doing well macroeconomic control and creating a fine market environment .  In accordance with the demands of government operations laws and economic development laws , we must adjust the direct intervention of government in economic activities , changing the scope of this involvement to a more rational level , such as primarily organizing the production of public goods , developing public benefit undertakings , and providing public services .  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
1 .  To coordinate the process of joining the WTO , Taiwan should decontrol direct cross-strait trade and direct postal and telecommunications services , and , considering the Mainland 's moves to lower its trade barriers , appropriately increase and open up Mainland imports .  Meanwhile , Taiwan should also plan to set up an " early warning system governing cross-strait trade security " to take charge of affairs relevant to national security and industrial risks .  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
Principal leader of local governments should bear primary responsibility for industrial safety .  Those bearing direct administrative responsibility for serious industrial accidents should be punished .  Second , the industrial safety management and supervision institutions should be strengthened .  
Taiwan 's economic growth rate for the second quarter of 2001 was minus 2.35 percent , Taiwan 's economic growth rate for 2001 will be a negative figure for the first time , and Taiwan people have been complaining everywhere .  It fully showed : Taiwan authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has been extremely unpopular and come to a dead end .  If they still refuse to loosen their restrictions and facilitate the three cross-strait direct links as soon as possible , Taiwan 's economy will face an even greater disaster .  
Zhang Deguang said , as a result of more than 10 years of accumulated experience , China and Russia have built a whole set of effective mechanisms for developing good neighborliness , friendship , and strategic coordination , from the periodic meetings of their heads of state and heads of government to bilateral direct contacts between counterpart departments .  These mechanisms involve various fields such as politics , economics , and science and technology , and they are being more and more perfected and standardized .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
The average annual indirect income should come to 150 to 200 billion yuan if calculated according to a ratio of one-to-two to three ( a conservative estimate ) between direct incomes from civil aviation and the indirect incomes ( tourist , insurance , and postal earnings for instance ) .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
This vast strategy geared to the new century will not only help to attain common prosperity , strengthen the unity of nationalities , and maintain social stability and border tranquillity , and help to expand domestic demand , open up markets , and provide a new support force for economic development , but will also have a direct bearing on whether the goal of the third step in China 's modernization strategy ( to reach the standard of a medium , developed country by mid-century ) can be attained .  
A short time ago , the Legislative Council members of the " democratic factions " proposed a motion to " revise the Basic Law , " demanding that all the members of the Legislative Council be elected through direct voting ahead of schedule , and that the chief executive of the HKSAR be directly elected by way of " one man one vote . "

"  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
It is conceivable that the series of matters on international human rights that were given assurance in Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech will surely bring forth unprecedented warm relations between them and international anti-China forces and human rights organizations , and lead to international human rights organization conducting activities in Taiwan " legally , " thereby winning direct and indirectly new support and protection for " Taiwan independence . "  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
they proclaim that they take the popular will as the guide in everything , yet turn a deaf ear to and set aside the strong aspirations of the Taiwan compatriots in demanding direct cross-strait flights , putting into effect the " three links , " and changing the policy of " no haste , be patient . "  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
With regard to the attempt of the United States to deploy its advanced TMD [ theatre missile defense ] in northeast Asia in the course of developing its NMD , Sha Zukang pointed out that this has constituted a direct threat to the effectiveness of China 's existing limited nuclear force .  
It is learned that the ARATS and the New Party have discussed and reached consensus on some important issues concerning current relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , including upholding the one-China principle , opposing " Taiwan independence , " promoting direct " links in trade , transportation and postal services " and developing economic cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
After joining the WTO and gradually opening up its domestic financial markets , what China will be faced with will be a direct confrontation between the strength of the international and domestic markets , and the primary responsibility of the State Administration of Exchange Control will be to read market signals and rely on modern financial programs and methods to dispel and crack down on various speculative activities promptly , upholding orderly and legitimate market competition and safeguarding the economic and financial security of the state .  
With regard to building a rapid reaction mechanism for the market , we should make efforts to counter speculation in the foreign exchange realm our starting point , because once we join the WTO , the foreign currency management departments will of course have to employ after-the-fact inspections to uncover illegal activity in the foreign exchange realm and crack down on it sharply , but the more important thing will be the direct and preemptive disruption of speculative offensive behavior targeting China 's financial markets .  
People are convinced that , under the direct push by the leaders of the two countries and with joint efforts of both sides , the strategic cooperation partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] between China and Russia will certainly be further strengthened , and the economic cooperation between the two countries will continue to develop in a stable manner .  
We must exert great efforts to standardize the government procurement procedure and make direct payments from the state treasury .  It is necessary to make the procurement procedure open , standardized , fair , and transparent so as to solve the problems that exist right now such as decentralized procurement , redundant procurement , blind procurement , and receiving kickbacks , and so on .  We must crack down on corruptive practices , while reducing expenditures .  
Luo Gan said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very much concerned about Xinjiang 's economic development and social and political stability .  The task of maintaining Xinjiang 's social and political stability is arduous so I hope that Xinjiang 's judicial organs , under direct leadership of the regional party committee and government , will further seek consensus , strengthen cooperation , duly focus attention on the drive to improve social order , and carry out other special struggles .  
Within a short time , Xinhuanet , which was comprehensively revised recently , has attracted widespread attention from all sectors of society with its authoritative and rich information , views that sweep down irresistibly from a commanding height , and in-depth reports that have a direct grip on major social issues .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
Today 's video and telephone conference emphasized that from now on , the industrial and commercial administration departments at all levels should keep a tight control on the issue of licenses and turn down all applications from units and individuals who are actually involved in illegal MLM and disguised MLM activities in the name of sole distribution , agency marketing , authorized partnership , direct marketing , chain marketing , or network marketing .  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
The leaders in charge of the public security and judicial work and the comprehensive management of public security , as the direct responsible person for maintaining social stability , should actively organize and coordinate the relevant departments , clearly divide up the work and define responsibility , pool efforts to do the work together , and promote a smooth investigation and mediation of contradictions and disputes .  
Commenting on the issues of direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links [ hereafter termed as the " three links " ] during a meeting with a Taiwan Lien-Ho Pao delegation in Beijing in late August , Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , pointed out : So long as Taiwan authorities acknowledge that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , relevant concrete problems can be easily resolved .  
To resolve the " three-link " issues , if both sides jointly recognize that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , both sides could simplify relevant provisions as much as possible .  Both sides definitely could refer and use the provisions governing direct experimental shipping between Fuzhou and Kaohsiung and between Xiamen and Kaohsiung . Thus , a lot of troubles can be avoided and sensitive issues can be easily resolved .  
After the explosion occurred , relevant leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Urumqi City promptly went to the scene of the explosion to direct rescue operations .  Several hundred public security personnel , armed police , and military personnel stationed in the area as well as more than 100 medical personnel swiftly plunged into fire fighting and rescue work .  The injured people were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment .  
He said that in order to replace direct and specific management with macroscopic and strategic guidance , the important thing is to create a fine policy and legal environment for the healthy growth and functioning of professional and technical personnel and to establish and perfect a mechanism which allows outstanding personnel to excel .  
and the East Asian countries have practiced a series of more favorable and open policies to attract foreign capital in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the Asian financial crisis .  In 1999 , the direct foreign investment in the Republic of Korea grew by 75.6 percent over the previous year , which is also an important factor leading to the decline of foreign capital flowing into China .  
Article 19 .  For those who violate the regulations in these measures by providing unlicensed commercial ISS , or by providing other services than those prescribed in their licenses , the telecommunications administrations of the provinces , autonomous regions , or municipalities under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction shall order them to mend their ways within a specified period , confiscate their illegal incomes , and impose on them a fine between three and five times of their illegal incomes .  
based on the principle " equality and mutual benefit , variety of forms , attention to practical results , and joint development , " China will adopt tangible measures to greatly step up Sino-African economic and trade and social development cooperation , and continually expand the spheres and channels of cooperation ; in particular , it will encourage direct links and exchanges between Chinese and African enterprises , so that the enterprises can play a still greater role in bilateral cooperation .  
At the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , continued management was given to the serious inflation problem , and an economic soft landing was achieved .  In the middle of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , given the trend toward deflation , a policy of monetary stabilization was implemented , moving from the use of primarily direct control toward using methods of indirect financial control ;  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
Vice Defense Minister Sun T'ao-yu said if the three mini direct links are established without cross-strait negotiation or without comprehensive control measures and other measures , some people from the mainland indeed may come to collect intelligence under the pretext of coming to Kinmen and Matsu for sightseeing or doing business and that will be harmful to our national defense .  
Leading enterprises are shouldered with the heavy responsibility of bringing along the growth of peasant households , exploring new markets , making scientific and technological innovations , and boosting the development of the regional economy .  The success or failure of leading enterprises has a direct bearing on our work to improve the economic efficiency of agriculture , to increase the income of our peasants , and to maintain the stability of rural areas .  
Various signs have indicated that the no haste , be patient policy will not be relaxed in the near future even if the government is willing to establish three direct cross-strait links [ direct trade , mail and transport links ] or the three mini direct links , because crucial decision-makers of the new government have taken an " unshakable " stand toward the no haste , be patient policy .  This has also determined why the repeated motions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on relaxing the policy were turned down .  
Beijing is worried that Taiwan and the US would take this opportunity to resume their military cooperation which has been suspended since 1979 .  Recently , signs showing this have surfaced unceasingly .  The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act clearly stipulates that the US military headquarters in the Pacific should have " direct and confidential communications " with the Taiwan military .  In mid-December , Taiwan 's request of buying Aegis-class destroyers from the US was proposed again , and will be decided at the China-US meeting scheduled to be held in April next year .  
Leaders of the party and state have repeatedly reiterated sticking to the basic guideline of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and President Jiang 's eight proposals , continued to vigorously develop cross-strait economic cooperation , pushed for direct " three links " across the strait at an early date , and welcomed visits by Taiwan parties , bodies , and people of all circles to exchange views and promote consensus on opposing together " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait ties , and promoting the process of peaceful reunification .  
At the National Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Work Conference held in Beijing today , Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said that the anticipated objective of China 's total import and export amount for 2005 will be $ 650 billion , and that the scale of foreign direct investment absorbed in the next five years will remain at an average of $ 40 billion a year .  
At the same time as this , the new authorities ignored the requests of the widespread public in Taiwan for easing up , improvement and development of cross-strait relations , and ignored the urgent requests of numerous industrial and business circles to quicken cross-strait economic interchanges and cooperation .  They still obstinately insisted on Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] " no haste , be patient " policy , saying one thing about cross-strait direct " three links " and meaning another , completely lacking sincerity .  
An Min pointed out : For a long time , Taiwan authorities have rejected direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait and adopted a series of obstructive and restrictive policies .  This is out of keeping with the basic demands of the people on both sides of the strait and the development of the situation , and has infringed upon the fundamental interests of the people on both shores , especially the Taiwan people .  This practice is increasingly unpopular .  
In 1986 , our ministry announced management measures , and in 1993 our ministry in conjunction with the General Customs Administration promulgated the " Management Measures for Small-Volume Trade with the Taiwan Region . " Small-volume trade is conducted by approved small-volume trade companies under the supervision of Customs and is supplementary to the regular trade across the strait .  Its existence and development has advanced the understanding of the people on both sides of the strait and has played a positive role in encouraging direct trade across the strait .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Qian Qichen said , back in 1979 , based on the objective requirements of cross-strait economic development and exchanges of various kinds , we proposed the establishment of direct postal , transport , and commercial links across the strait .  It is regrettable that this has not yet been realized due to the obstacles raised by the Taiwan authorities .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Shortly after the Taiwan authorities started their so-called " mini three links , " the Kuomintang and the New Party separately dispatched their " three links " delegations to visit Beijing and expressed their discontent at the Taiwan authorities ' dilatory and perfunctory practice toward the " three links . "  This also shows that only complete and direct " three links " can really satisfy the urgent needs of the people on both sides of the strait .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .  
The relevant responsible persons of the provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities under direct central jurisdiction , cities with separate plans , some quasi-provincial level provincial capitals , and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps as well as responsible persons of the relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also attended the conference .  
He stressed the need to further promote the development of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges , promote the realization of direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date , and the need to seriously listen to the voice of Taiwan compatriots , increase exchanges with all political parties , organizations , and people in Taiwan who oppose division and support national reunification , and jointly make efforts to promote the development of cross-strait relations and realize the motherland 's complete reunification .  
Wan added that he was glad to see some Taiwan political parties and organizations visited and established ties with the mainland one after another ; industrial and commercial enterprises successively broke the restriction of " no haste , be patient " and made investments in the mainland ; there are mounting calls in Taiwan for direct " three links " ; and the anti - " independence " and pro-reunification forces have been growing .  The motherland 's reunification has become the focus of attention of the Chinese from around the world .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
On Sunday morning , Xiancheng Town in Guangdong 's Chaoyang City experienced a disturbance caused by more than 1,000 elementary school pupils .  As disclosed by the local police to this newspaper last night , during the disturbance , the office building of this town government was burned , and some windows and appliances were smashed .  The direct reason was that the township and town authorities began collecting additional education surcharge from the newly admitted pupils , thus arousing complaints among some students and their parents .  
As disclosed , the reason why the Shenyang people 's deputies were dissatisfied with the city court and city procuratorate 's reports was that this city has in recent years seen a series of shocking cases - - including party and government officials ' corruption cases , major cases involving criminal syndicates , and shooting cases - - some of which even bothered Zhongnanhai and required the central authorities ' direct intervention in the investigation and handling .  
In light of the principle of " uniting , educating , and saving the majority and following the law to attack the tiny minority , " the Ningxia party committee and government established the system of party and government chiefs holding overall responsibility and the leaders at each level assuming direct responsibility .  The regional party committee and government also assigned responsibility to the leading cadres at all levels .  Whoever slackens the work of transformation through supervision and education should be held responsible for negligence .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
carried out the pragmatic policies of " turning croplands back into woodlands ( or grasslands ) , closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation , giving the local people grain supply instead of outright grant , and signing preservation contracts with individual households .  Now a total of 188 counties in 17 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction have returned the grain plots to forestry or grassland .

The loans will then be paid direct into their personal accounts with a local bank , " he said .  
The consultants examined a number of options including the use of the existing public transport interchange of Hung Hom Station and the construction of a direct link to the Princess Margaret Road extension , and concluded that the only feasible traffic solution would be to link the proposed tower block with the podium to be built above the freight yard site i.e . making use of the vehicular access of the original freight yard project . 
Mr Ng pointed out that a total of 27 bus routes were serving the new Airport , including seven airbus routes providing more direct and premium services to the Air Passenger Terminal ; eight external routes serving both the airport terminal and the Tung Chung new town ; four overnight routes as well as other shuttle services within Chek Lap Kok . A high-speed ferry service operating between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Chek Lap Kok Ferry Pier was introduced to meet passenger demand .  
In the course of treatment , some clinical staff may commit errors due to factors related to experience , professional judgement and personal or other environmental reasons .  As a result , the patients concerned may not be able to receive proper treatment .  The occurrence of these isolated mistakes can not be construed to indicate that all our frontline clinical staff lack alertness or the sense of accountability , and neither does this have any direct relation with the strength of frontline manpower resources .  
There was a direct correlation between the level of air pollution and admissions to hospital for respiratory illness which led to a loss of productivity ; a loss of intellectual capital as sick children miss part of their schooling ; the social cost of the elderly requiring greater care and attention and the effect of dirty air in putting off tourists or potential business migrants .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
Every day , 4,000 tonnes of waste paper are produced .  About 2,000 tonnes are either part of domestic waste and go straight to landfills , mostly through USD and RSD collection services , or are of poor quality or contaminated commercial waste that the collectors again take direct to the landfills or refuse transfer stations .  
The Government has already allocated a very substantial proportion of public funds to the welfare sector on an annual basis , in terms of capital and recurrent resources .  In the financial year 1999 / 2000 , the subvention for direct services will rise to $ 6.2 billion from $ 5.4 billion .

Ltd . and the Hong Kong Telecom , to enable local and overseas philatelists to make direct purchase of postal products and souvenirs under a reliable and secure Internet environment .  
During the interviews , the enumerators noticed that respondents felt embarrassed and uneasy or held a perfunctory attitude when being asked questions related to this topic .  Thus the number of " children born out of registered marriage " established via the " direct questioning method " can not be relied on .

"  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
Regarding the proposals of the Education Commission to allocate 85 per cent of Primary One places on the principle of " vicinity " and to encourage primary and secondary schools to link among themselves to facilitate direct admission of Primary Six students to the linked secondary schools , there are comments that such proposals will result in more parents giving false residential addresses or moving to districts which fall within the school nets of their preferred schools so as to enhance the chance of their children being admitted to those schools .  
These included the release of the first set of quarterly Gross National Product statistics for the first quarter of 1999 in December 1999 and the release of the first complete set of external direct investment statistics for 1998 in March 2000 , encompassing both the stock and flow of inward and outward direct investments .

Within the total factor income outflow , DII surged by 91.6% in the first quarter of 2000 over a year earlier .  This reflected a distinct pick-up in earnings from direct investment in Hong Kong , particularly by those engaged in financial business , as the recovery of the local economy became more entrenched .  
The net outflow of financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by a net outflow in direct investment due to increased investment by Hong Kong residents abroad , a shift to net outflow due to cash settlement of financial derivatives , and a continued though reduced net outflow in other investment , but a continued huge net inflow in portfolio investment .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 66.7 billion and $ 65.3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 over the preceding quarter , reflecting the much improved regional and local investment situation upon the economic revival .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .

On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 78.5 billion and $ 137.1 billion during the second quarter of 2000 , reflecting the improved regional and local investment environment upon the economic revival .  
While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .

Where direct engineering solutions were impracticable or when these solutions alone were inadequate in reducing the noise to an acceptable level , the feasibility of non-engineering solutions such as traffic management measures would be explored on a selective basis and implemented where practicable case-by-case .  
What is particularly encouraging is that between 1999 and 2000 , the number of regional headquarters and offices established by multinational corporations in Hong Kong increased from 2,500 to 3,000 ; Hong Kong is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Asia after Mainland China , amounting to US $ 23.1 billion last year .

Some 3 000 overseas companies have established their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong . Two years ago we attracted the second highest amount of external direct investment in Asia , just behind the Mainland and far exceeding other places in Asia .

That is why in our education reforms , while continuing to make primary and secondary education even more widely available , while committing to improve the quality of our entire public school system , we have also put in place the important initiative to enhance the competitiveness of direct subsidy scheme schools , and to help more private schools to meet the diverse quality needs of different parents and students .  
In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .  
He said : " While the traditional telephone operating function ceased to exist following the development of modern direct dialing system , with the provision of training , acquisition of special equipment and alteration to office premises for the disabled telephone operators , the remaining staff are now engaged in answering telephone enquiries and assisting in reception and clerical duties .

( b ) HA is currently conducting a comprehensive review on its nursing grade structure .  The purpose of the review is to re-organise the nursing grade structure to focus on the delivery of direct patient care by way of a primary nursing practice model ( whereby each patient is assigned to the care of a primary nurse during hospitalisation ) , and professional accountability with a view to providing quality patient care .  
In addition , the Pharmacy and Poisons Board proposes to relax the control of Clobetasone butyrate when contained in preparations intended for external application only at not more than 0.05% so that its sale does not require the support of a prescription but still has to be sold by authorised sellers of poisons under the direct supervision of registered pharmacists .

The " Memorandum of Arrangement " enables contact points to be set up for direct exchange of information on air passengers and cargoes that are in transit , departing or bound for one of the two Airports and that are suspected or known to be connected with Customs offences such as illegal trafficking of narcotic drugs and smuggling of contraband .  
The direct income based taxation system in Hong Kong consists of three individual taxes , Property Tax , Salaries Tax and Profits Tax , each of which is separately assessed independently of the others .  Only Salaries Tax carries an entitlement to deduct personal allowances and to be charged at progressive rates of tax ; the other taxes are charged at a fixed single rate of tax with no deductions for personal allowances .

Mr Passow continued , " The criteria for all awards was based on conversations by the editorial staff with consultants from the major accounting and financial service firms who monitor direct international investment flows and the tracking by Euromoney 's editorial staff of public information on the dollar amounts of deals in the Asia Pacific area .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
" RSV is a common cause of respiratory tract infection worldwide .  It is spread by direct contact with infectious secretions , or droplets spread indirectly through contaminated hands , eating utensils , or articles freshly soiled by nasal discharge of the infected person .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
Pastor Chou pointed out that the free translation , adoption of special literary styles such as parallelism , and the elimination of conjunctions as far as possible , have allowed the true meaning of the Bible 's religious terminology and idioms to be preserved . The manipulation of punctuation marks , verbs and direct and indirect quotations , have also helped to make the modern Chinese Bible more colloquial , simple , graceful and beautiful .  
But the concern today is that among the competing claims of salon , nature , conceptual , documentary , and other schools , photographers may become lost between empty formalism and blind conceptualism and that the basic nature of photography may be forgotten - - the pure , direct , and honest observation and recording of reality .  
The majority of Ch'en Keng-pin 's photos are of natural scenery , where his employment of crystal-clear priorities and a delicate , quality feel took the place of the typically obscure , artificial beautification of other photographers . These attributes provided a more direct and powerful expression to the essential face of his photography .  
Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
The US stands in sharp contrast to Japan , respecting the individual , pursuing happiness , favoring direct expression . Because of its vast size , attention is focussed on domestic matters , and there is a common lack of understanding of the outside world .  
With an educational credit system inherited from Europe , Australian universities used to recognize degrees from Taiwan from only a few public universities as qualifying their holders for direct admission to graduate school , but they have gradually relaxed their standards . Only a few , such as Sydney and Melbourne , are more strict and may require an oral interview or a trial year in the undergraduate program before deciding on admission .  
" Even so , seventy performances in a hundred-seat venue only amounts to a total audience of 7,000 , " says Li , running off figures fast and precise , Woody Allen fashion . " When direct and indirect production costs for the play are taken into account , including auditorium rental and personnel overneads , we are talking about a net loss of NT $ 150,000 . " What then would satisfy him ?  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
Maintain Flexibility : Big corporations invest not only in real estate , they also invest in the restaurant , dry goods , and gift industries , consequently merging several stores to become a largescale shopping center . Restaurants have also become beautifully decorated with service provided by equally well adorned girls . This is a direct challenge to established enterprises . "  
In " An Open Letter to Our Compatriots on Taiwan , " delivered in 1979 before the National People 's Congress by standing central committee member Ye Jianying , the Communists declared that they would cease shelling Kinmen , Matsu and other offshore islands and would set up navigation and postal links as soon as possible to facilitate direct contacts between the two sides and carry out acade mic and cultural exchange .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Making a choice for the childQ : After Chi An became pregnant with her second child in the United States , she was unwilling to have an abortion there , and she was afraid that when she returned to mainland China she would be forced to abort . With your help , she received political asylum and stayed in the US . In fact , she never incurred any direct oppression . Why was her application successful ?  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative . And they are no different from conventional books - - they can be divided into ones which merely stimulate the senses , and ones which contain deep thought .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
Lin Yu-ping went the island to observe the troupe . Liu says that upon striking the drum , the whole wooden classroom resonated as if the room itself had been struck . The resultant sound , he recounts , can not be described as music , nor as rhythm , but rather as a direct assault upon one 's body , which " awakens your entire being . " The visitor is quite shaken by the experience .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
If the star is successful , the program pays for the person 's desired prize ; otherwise , the person 's hope is left unrealized . The format of this segment resembles the old show Loving Heart , which encouraged people to help some unfortunate . But the new program has an even more direct emotional appeal insofar as it cuts in live shots of the reactions of the hosts and audience members , sometimes zooming in on the superstar celebrities as they weep .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
The Executive Yuan news website , established by the Government Information Office ( GIO ) , was formally launched in August . This new website , designed as a part of the drive for " electronic , Internet-wired government , " is the Executive Yuan 's own dedicated news operation , providing audio-visual real-time news , along with information on policies and measures of the Executive Yuan . The site also takes advantage of the Net 's rapid interactive capability to give the public a direct channel of communication with the Executive Yuan .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
He is especially appreciative of the way older folks take care of their gongs . In a temple parade , direct exposure to the hot sun can get a gong too hot and foul up its sound . When this happens , the old folks will wipe a gong with a wet cloth and wait for it to cool before striking it .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance . Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities , and shall refrain from recruiting any such person into their armed forces .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
In 1996 , the ROC 's first direct presidential election marked the first time ever that Chinese people could select their own leader on a one-man , one-vote basis . But it was also when cross-strait relations reached their nadir , as the mainland undertook missile tests prior to the election , creating extreme tension . The resulting freeze in political relations created circumstances under which any national leader of Taiwan would have to make national security the top priority .  
In 1996 Chou read an article about oceanographic research in which the writer , inspired by everyday experience , described how even in a closed room with no direct light source , scattered sunlight ( " ambient light " ) entering the room and striking objects is reflected into people 's eyes to form images , so that people in the room can still see each other .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
Wu Hsiao-ming , a doctoral candidate in international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai , assumed when he entered in 1997 that it would n't be long before direct travel would be possible between the two sides . Five years have passed and the prospect of direct travel is still remote . Many students likewise thought that the government would recognize mainland degrees by the time they finished their programs , and that everything would be smooth sailing thereafter , but this idea has proved far removed from reality .  
The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
Before the 1960s , one third of Taiwan families were classified as " patriarchal families . " These were " extended families " consisting of both direct and co-lateral family members living together . After the 1980s the proportion of " blended families " ( a " stem " family composed of three directly related generations ) increased . Today it is the " nuclear family " of husband , wife and children that has become the norm .  
Wu Huang , deputy secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , explains further : " Precisely because the range of renewable energies is so diverse , each country has to direct its limited resources toward the development of selected areas in which it has an advantage . Thus Germany is developing wind power and Japan hydroelectric power . In Taiwan we hope to achieve a balanced development of hydro , wind , geothermal , biomass and photovoltaic energy sources . "  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who

An effective method of isolating and eliminating these sources of violence should be accompanied by strict implementation of the peace agreements , especially those which have a direct and indirect impact on the situation of human rights or common violence .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
A number of seminars and discussion forums intended for large audiences were organized , aiming to enhance popular understanding of foreign direct investment , its developmental potential , and the relevant policy issues .  
In these circumstances , the Russianspeaking population of Latvia is becoming an easy target for radical nationalist bureaucrats performing arbitrary and lawless acts with the secret but , in fact , direct connivance of the political leadership .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
Promotion of access to land and security of tenure for all urban residents , in particular the poor , through improved land market transparency and innovative mechanisms to utilize public and private land , including fiscal incentives to bring unutilized land into use , improved land-delivery and land-tenure systems and , where appropriate , direct government and municipal landownership ;  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
The difficulties besetting African countries are still present : the crushing burden of external debt , the steady deterioration of the terms of trade , the scant inflow of resources and direct foreign investment and the continued degradation of the environment because of the growing , interrelated pressures of the population and poverty .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .

The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
Sometimes this means that certain conflicts whose threat to international stability is not obvious swallow up considerable funds , with large contingents of peace-keeping forces being sent immediately , whereas in other instances we believe the Security Council is slow to act , sometimes taking months to study a situation and limiting itself in the final analysis to sending small groups of observers , despite the direct request made by the leaders of the States concerned .  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
Few impediments to progress are more implacable and emotional than that of Israeli settlers who both remain in and continue to settle the occupied territories , and that this could be supported by the Israeli Government in full knowledge of the ultimate and unavoidable consequences is difficult to believe when there is plainly a direct correlation between the violence in the occupied territories and the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank .

Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .  
In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .  
Established in 1988 , the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) promotes foreign direct investment for economic and social development in borrowing member countries by guaranteeing investments against political risks , helping countries to create an attractive investment climate and providing promotional and advisory services .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .

The UNV programme has consistently sought to promote participatory processes by using appropriate volunteer modalities , including mixed teams of international and national personnel , and by creating direct linkages between UNV specialists and local populations .  
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .

The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .

NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
In particular , the main purposes of the Decade were lost among initiatives of limited scope or proposals to establish direct communication links between the United Nations system and indigenous communities , without due regard to the legitimate role of national Governments as the appropriate channel for international cooperation .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .

The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .  
The bands of Taliban , under the direct control of the Pakistani Government , recently gathered at the outskirts of the capital Kabul and suffered repeated setbacks as a result of the crushing blows by the forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , thus falling short of their heinous plans of taking over the city of Kabul .

flow of men and mat ï¿½ï¿½ iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
Efforts to perfect Cuba 's political system and the rule of law had included the strengthening of constitutional rights and the enactment of a new election law providing for free , direct and secret parliamentary elections for the direct , popular nomination of candidates , without any need for political affiliation or party membership .  
Above and beyond the creation of a dense industrial network , the direct involvement of the State in economic management has made it possible for us to take on the considerable and manifold needs of a population deprived of essentials in the areas of education , health , jobs and housing and to set up an infrastructure even in the remotest corners of our vast territory .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .

If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
We note with interest that Germany , a nation widely regarded as a potential direct beneficiary of an increase in permanent membership , put forward the idea that new permanent members should not be eternal but subject to periodic review with a 15-year interval in the form of a General Assembly vote .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
It should be marked by a constant , unfailing mobilization of efforts to dismantle the criminal chain of terrorism , including those who are perpetrators , those who are behind them , the various political networks and their sources of financing and supply , and the direct or indirect logistical support given by individuals , groups or States .  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Multiple frameworks generate confusion at both political and administrative levels about which frameworks prevail over others ; often compete for the small pool of highly qualified national personnel available to direct and implement the planning exercises ; and raise expectations about sectoral planning that are not achievable except through persistent commitment at the national and international levels . 
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .

In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .

Other countries like Benin , Ethiopia and Senegal , which experienced a severe decline in foreign direct investment during the previous decade , have managed to arrest and even reverse this trend as a result of reforms and with the advent of an encouraging economic outlook .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
The general conclusion is that timber export taxes and bans have proved only moderately successful in achieving the desired results in South-east Asia , and in many cases they were achieved at high economic cost , in terms of both the direct costs of subsidization and the additional costs of wasteful and inefficient processing operations .  
Cuba considers that the considerable problems with anti-personnel mines experienced by a number of third world countries are due in large part , if we limit ourselves to the most direct causes , to the unscrupulous export policies which have been extensively practised by several developed countries ; these have made substantial profits from such operations and taken little account of the impact on the civilian populations of many countries .  
In principle , estimates should cover both the direct , first round impact of sanctions ( which is evaluated as the income forgone and additional costs incurred , resulting from terminated trade in goods and services and suspended financial transfers ) and the indirect , second round effects such as the reduction of imported inputs following the decline of exports or output .  
They are based on the concept of direct ( impact on the balance of payments ) , indirect and additional losses and include the methods of evaluating losses declared by Bulgarian economic entities , of analysis and simulation of foreign trade with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the country 's balance of payments ( trade in goods and services ) as well as the method of expert analysis by line ministries .

UNICEF emphasizes the need to sustain investment in children in good times and in bad , and in times of fiscal restraint and economic liberalization .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
They are , rather , the direct result of a long-term and focused plan of action that took concrete and unmistakable shape following the assumption of power by the new Israeli Government , which is pursuing an aggressive expansionist policy in violation of the agreements concluded by the former Government of Israel .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .

Thus the decisive impact of transport efficiency on countries ' competitiveness and their ability to attract foreign direct investment is obvious : since the annual cost of international maritime transport was estimated at US $ 250-billion in 1994 ( half of which being incurred in ports ) , a 5 per cent reduction in port and transport costs could save traders some US $ 12.5-billion per annum .

the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .

As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alvaro Ramos , said earlier in the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , the international community must continue to encourage direct dialogue between Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries in order to support mutual recognition and faithfulness to the ultimate objective of a firm and lasting peace in the Middle East .

Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .

It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .

UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
In fact , evidence obtained by the military authorities of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on the command and control of military campaigns , the extensive use of heavy artillery and superior air power and the use of night vision equipment to advance in the dark clearly casts aside all doubts about the discernible direct and large-scale Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan and overt military assistance to the Taliban .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
These 5 May agreements requested the Secretary-General to determine , through a popular consultation based upon a universal , direct and secret ballot , whether the East Timorese people would accept or reject a proposed special autonomy for East Timor within the unitary Republic of Indonesia .  
My delegation participated in that debate , and therefore I will confine myself to repeating here that my country is convinced of the importance of raising to 18 years the minimum age for recruitment be it voluntary or mandatory , by regular armed forces or armed opposition groups and for direct or indirect participation in armed conflicts .  
Moreover , the special combination of inputs technical assistance and emergency supplies on the one hand and materials for construction and water equipment on the other ( benefiting approximately 110,000 people ) has made possible the implementation of an integrated emergency and rehabilitation programme whose overall objective is to facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition from emergency to development , through effective and direct involvement of the beneficiaries themselves . 
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
If the prospector wishes to claim expenditures for prospecting as part of the development costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production , the prospector shall submit an annual statement , in conformity with internationally accepted accounting principles and certified by a duly qualified firm of public accountants , of the actual and direct expenditures incurred by the prospector in carrying out prospecting .  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
In that regard , foreign direct investment , technical assistance for national capacity-building and export outlets were but a few of the indispensable conditions for the participation of the South in world trade .  Vigorous and sustainable economic growth , which could greatly foster employment and poverty eradication efforts , was vital .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
Despite numerous obstacles , the process of implementing the settlement plan and the Houston agreements was back on track after five rounds of direct negotiations between Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro ( POLISARIO ) yielding to the irreversible course of history and the general belief that the conflict could be resolved by the only worthy means , on the basis of the free and sovereign expression of its will by the Saharan people . 
Mr . Rao ( Observer for the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) ) said that the objectives of the Decade were close to the nature and functions of WIPO , which was not only the international secretariat for existing treaty bodies relating to intellectual property but was also unique in that it provided direct access to private innovators and industry for the registration of patents , trademarks and industrial designs for the purpose of international recognition .  
Our presence here is proof of the fact that , astonishing though it may seem , the newly developed media and means of communication can not satisfy the need human beings feel for personal and direct contact in order to establish a dialogue conducive to peace this fact was certainly not lost on the founding fathers of the United Nations system .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the policies of reform being implemented by African countries , their economic situation remains critical and African recovery and development continue to be severely hindered by , inter alia , the persistence of lower commodity prices and the heavy debt burden and are also substantially affected by the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment , as well as the ongoing conflicts in some regions of the continent ,  
He reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , but opposed specific reference to Jerusalem in the resolutions in question because , just as the conference of 15 July attended by some High Contracting Parties had served only to divert attention from the peace process , such references sought to prejudge arrangements which could be determined only by direct negotiations between the parties .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Their activities were legitimate , competitive and regulated ; they were not dissimilar from those of developed countries that encouraged foreign direct investment .  
It not only affected those who were subject to its direct indiscriminate attacks , but it posed a real threat to international peace and security , and endangered the political process in the international arena , including the peace process in the Middle East .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
In contrast , it held that discretionary payments for ongoing ordinary living expenses that are incurred after a person has left the region and taken up a new residence should not normally be considered to be direct consequences of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait .  
On 5 May 1999 , at a historic ceremony in New York , the three agreements were signed : a main , overall Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Portugal on the question of East Timor , to which was annexed the constitutional framework for autonomy as revised and submitted by Indonesia , an agreement regarding the modalities for the popular consultation of the East Timorese through a direct , secret ballot , and a broad agreement on security arrangements .  
In accordance with a guideline laid down by the Board of Trustees , the Fund as a rule only finances up to a third ( 33.33 per cent ) of any programme of assistance submitted to it and only finances those activities of an organization that are intended to provide the victims of torture with direct medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian or legal assistance ; it does not provide financial aid for other victims or other activities of the help organizations .  
Among the extrajudicial executions confirmed , of those for which the National Civil Police bears direct responsibility , special mention should be made of cases where a person , after being arrested for drunkenness or disorderly conduct , winds up dead on arrival or dies shortly after being admitted to hospital , presumably after being beaten by the arresting officers . 
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
The main purpose of these conferences , held with the direct and active participation of young people , was to raise the general publics awareness of the goals set and the commitments undertaken by Governments , to promote dialogue with the decision makers on follow-ups and to encourage an active involvement of young people , civil society and the local governments in the implementation of the relevant national plans of action .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;  
HIC regional networks and committees organized their own Habitat II processes to contribute to the Conference ; the myriad of activities , projects , meetings , publications and other contributions of these civil society processes developed , managed and promoted by HIC and its members could not be listed within this brief space , which notes only some direct HIC contributions to the official process .  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .  
This can be achieved through direct government policies , joint ventures with local private initiatives , and foreign investment from regional and international public and private banks .  
Article 17 of the Criminal Code stipulates that persons who act as accessories after the fact for their spouse or legitimate relatives by blood or marriage , throughout the direct and collateral lines up to the second degree , as well as natural parents and children born out of wedlock , shall be exempt from the penalties imposed for concealment , unless they have profited from the effects of the crime or ordinary offence . 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
On establishing , with reasonable certainty , that a valid contractual relationship existed at the time of Iraqs invasion of Kuwait and that the contractual relationship was terminated or suspended as a direct result of the invasion , the Panel assesses whether the loss asserted was suffered in the amount claimed , i.e . , whether the loss asserted can be reconciled with the contractual terms .  
As the Panel has previously concluded , a ] where the loss can not be related to one of the acts or circumstances identified in paragraph 21 of decision 7 , a special showing is required to demonstrate that the loss sustained was a direct consequence of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . a ] The Panel therefore first considers which geographical areas involved in the claims under review were affected by the circumstances or events , set out in paragraph 21 ( a ) . 
At 1445 hours on 28 February 1999 , radio station 6 ( RS-6 ) , the key link in the system controlling the operation of the Iraq-Turkey pipeline and located 40 kilometres south-west of Mosul in an area where there are no other installations for several kilometres round about , was the target of a direct and savage attack by United States aircraft coming from Turkey . 
UNCTAD ' s technical cooperation activities are an essential complement to its analytical and policy work , providing practical and direct benefits to recipient countries and also serving as a conduit for the assimilation of development experiences at the country and regional levels into more coherent and development-friendly policy approaches at the international level .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
We are grateful that the international community is increasingly focusing its efforts not so much on dealing with the direct consequences of the past internal conflict in our country but rather on providing comprehensive assistance to the consistent implementation in Tajikistan of socio-economic and democratic reforms , which are strongly supported by the leadership of our country .  
We emphasize that , in addition to the direct impact on the physical infrastructure of the health , education , housing and human settlements sectors , one of the principal effects of natures ravages on the population is their increased vulnerability to disease and the deterioration of nutritional and food security ; it is therefore essential to give priority to these aspects on the regional integration agenda .  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
The representative of Australia recognized that the intention of article 3 was to enunciate a key concept in the draft declaration , namely the legitimate aspirations of indigenous peoples to enjoy more direct and meaningful participation in decision-making and political processes and greater autonomy over their own affairs .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
To make matters worse , they find it difficult without the requisite technology and human resource base to attract foreign direct investment , which is increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging economies .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development , and it recognizes the importance of private capital , particularly foreign direct investment , in development financing .  
While womens advancement is a globally accepted goal , it should also be recognized that prevailing conditions at the local level , whether social , political or economic , have a direct bearing on the pace at which this process evolves .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
Governments call upon United Nations organizations , NGOs , the private sector and relevant civil society organizations to show strong political will and commitment to human development and direct investments to these critical areas .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
Montenegro is shifting to transitional initiatives , for which the international community has deepened its support , including direct bilateral aid in the form of budgetary support and technical assistance for institutional reform .  
Crimes were committed with the direct participation of soldiers in active duty , the Interahamwe and political and administrative authorities at the local as well as the national level .  
Contrary to many assumptions , GuineaBissau was able to institute a democratic regime in which the main political bodies are headed by officials elected by direct and universal suffrage , in elections supervised by the United Nations .  
In addition , he cited successful cases of direct funding by bilateral donor agencies , where they identified and funded local microcredit organizations perceived as potential leaders or winners . 
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Noting the concern and apprehension of the partners of the International Coral Reef Initiative that the extensive evidence that coral reef ecosystems continue to be damaged or severely degraded as the result of both direct human activities and global climate change as witnessed by the increased global incidence of episodes of coral bleaching since its twentieth session ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and objectives are defined , bearing in mind the direct link between inputs and outputs , and that inputs are commensurate with the needs of programmes , and taking into consideration the international character of the United Nations , the purposes of its Charter and its legislative mandates , as well as the fact that the objectives of the Organization may not be realized in one medium-term plan only ;  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
Large-scale interregional projects are currently being implemented on the initiative of and with direct participation by Turkmenistan in the energy , transport and communication sectors with a view to giving impetus to the accelerated economic development of the countries of the region and narrowing the technology gap between developed and developing and industrial and agrarian States .  
The former instrument had required direct incorporation of the principle of individual responsibility into existing norms of international humanitarian law ; the Rules of Procedure and Evidence had rightly combined various traditional and procedural traditions .  
On the basis of the foregoing and given all of these facts , the Government of the Republic of Iraq urges you to order a prompt inquiry , to be conducted by reliable medical and scientific authorities in cooperation with the relevant Iraqi scientific bodies , into the use of depleted uranium against Iraq and to expose such use as a direct cause of injury to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and of damage to all aspects of the environment .  
UNIDO also had a local role to play in helping to establish a reliable and transparent legal and economic environment conducive to direct foreign investment .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
In that sense , Peru endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications but believed that the measures covered by the Programme could be carried out only through effective international cooperation based on access to technology , the elaboration of specific projects for space activities and the transmission of processed information that would have a practical and direct effect on the sustainable development of States . 
The reply describes emergency humanitarian assistance for the displaced population ; direct emergency humanitarian assistance for cases of mass displacement ; non-food aid for mass displacements ; individual and family humanitarian assistance ; and a scheme of independently-managed humanitarian assistance which is not confined to emergency humanitarian support but involves major investments to help restore the social and economic stability of the displaced population .  
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
To appeal to the United States of America to engage in a direct dialogue on equal terms with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , in order to discuss and resolve whatever factors may be preventing the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries , and allow the Lockerbie case to take its legal and judicial course , as required by the nature of the dispute and as agreed by all parties , free from pressures of any kind ;  
The list that follows is not exhaustive , but the Panels choice was based on the crucial roles played by these persons and their direct involvement in either providing support , entertaining networks or facilitating the exploitation of natural resources within the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Ending corruption is fundamental for mobilizing domestic resources , and increased direct and indirect measures are required , including increased transparency , in both government and private sector activities .  Fighting corruption is one of the main priorities of the development agenda and this has been a strong message from a wide spectrum of countries .  
Under the direct supervision of the Senior Adviser to the Executive Director , the incumbent collects and analyses data pertinent to the management of the organization ; organizes and summarizes background information and prepares summary reports on specific issues analysed , and develops draft recommendations thereon ; holds consultative meetings with senior staff in UNEP and the United Nations Office at Nairobi to seek information required and to discuss work practices ; and contributes to developing and strategizing the presentation of management data ;  
As a direct result of these workshops and follow-up networking and provision of information , two major television channels broadcast television programmes on the adverse effects of female genital cutting ( FGC ) a topic that was hitherto considered a taboo in television programming .  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
The UNMIBH police commissioner project remains an essential institutional initiative for creating an apolitical police service , shielded from direct political interference from the ministries by functioning under a single chain of command led by an experienced police professional , designated Police Commissioner or Director of Police .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
The sixth and most important step , which will have an immediate , positive impact , is to direct greater investment and efforts towards increasing societal awareness of HIV / AIDS , and to create an international sense of responsibility at the individual level , with greater emphasis on decent behaviour and adherence to moral values and virtues .  
Urge the international community , particularly donor countries , civil society , as well as the private sector to complement effectively national programmes to support programmes for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV / AIDS in affected regions , in countries at high risk and to direct special assistance to sub-Saharan Africa ;  
Urges States [ to adopt and implement , or strengthen wherever necessary , national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter racism and prohibit racial discrimination , whether direct or indirect , in all spheres of public life in conformity with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination without making limiting reservations and to review existing measures with a view to amending or revising national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act . 
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Following the Iraqi declaration of a comprehensive and eternal merger with Kuwait , the Security Council in Resolution 662 ( 1990 ) , decided that the annexation had no legal validity , and is considered null and void , and called upon all States , international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as a recognition of it , whether direct or indirect .  
The evaluation report envisages a range of flexible service delivery and implementation modalities , with an expanded use of direct services by UNDP as an essential component combined with a coherent accountability and oversight framework and clear performance standards with the requisite internal capacities .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
Anti-trust-law which was aimed at preserving workable markets ( i.e . markets that were subject to workable competition obliging enterprises to meet the prices of rivals ) could aid in this process through the creation of the right conditions for the transferor and the recipient that established a balance between the interests of all parties ( in subcontracting , foreign direct investment , research and development cooperation and licensing ) , although this balance must be adjusted to the specific circumstances prevailing in individual cases .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
For the majority of the CEE region countries not so affected by direct desertification but faced by land degradation and so on , the major tasks are , inter alia , to establish and maintain the optimum proportions of arable land , meadows , pastures , forests and water areas in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and the capacity of the environment , to decrease over-cultivation of agricultural land through selective afforestation , bio-corridors or establishment of grasslands .  
In addition and this , too , is a serious matter through the technology of the communications media , which showed the entire world live and direct the distressing images from New York , Washington and Pennsylvania , an entire generation of children and adolescents has been marked by fear and insecurity ; unable to find reasons , they ask themselves why these inhuman acts occurred and what kind of future awaits them .
