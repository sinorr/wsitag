In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .

There is already widespread but not universal agreement that it will be necessary to consider legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for countries listed in annex I to the Convention that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames , such as 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .

While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty .

As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .

The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 , to ' the representation of different forms of civilization ' was not only unnecessary but constituted a harmful precedent in the universal and holistic conception of human rights , if it was borne in mind that , under the pretext of defending particular forms of civilization , human rights were in many cases flagrantly and continuously violated .  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .

The main attention of the agreed conclusions on education and training of women was directed towards the implementation of the goals and benchmarks set by the Platform for Action with regard to the equal and universal access of girls to education . 4 In order to implement those goals and to create an enabling environment to retain women and girls in schools , school authorities , parents , and administrative personnel should , inter alia , ensure safety in schools and during extracurricular activities and organize school teaching programmes , transport , and boarding schools , if necessary .

In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .

There is already widespread but not universal agreement that it will be necessary to consider legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for countries listed in annex I to the Convention that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames , such as 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis .

While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
This approach illustrates that the United Nations is treated ultimately by Governments as a creature of national self-interest where national sovereignty is supreme , however and by whomever that is defined , and not equipped with conditions to reflect universal rights and growing transnational concerns .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .

General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .

As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .

The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 , to ' the representation of different forms of civilization ' was not only unnecessary but constituted a harmful precedent in the universal and holistic conception of human rights , if it was borne in mind that , under the pretext of defending particular forms of civilization , human rights were in many cases flagrantly and continuously violated .  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .
