China advocates strengthening the dialogue and communications between developed countries and developing countries .

They stressed the necessity [ English version uses " need " ] to establish an equitable , just , fair and reasonable new international political and economic order that is free of hegemonism and power politics and is based on equality .  They indicated their readiness to work together for the establishment of such a new order .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
He said that the following three basic principles must be stressed in establishing a new international and economic order that is peaceful , stable , equitable and just : First , all countries , big or small , should be treated as equal .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : In the 21st century , China will continue to resolutely and unwaveringly uphold the reform and opening-up policy and pursue an independent foreign policy of peace .

The motion , to be moved by Dr Hon Leong Che-hung , says : " That this Council urges the people of Hong Kong to respond positively to the report , " Improving Hong Kong 's Health Care System : Why and For Whom ?

" To achieve this aim , the health care system must be able to protect and promote the health of the community ; to provide comprehensive and lifelong holistic care to each individual ; to offer accessible , equitable and quality services to each patient , and at the same time to remain cost effective , sustainable and affordable .  
To achieve this aim , the health care system must be able to protect and promote the health of the community ; to provide comprehensive and lifelong holistic care to each individual ; to offer accessible , equitable and quality services to each patient , and at the same time to remain cost effective , sustainable and affordable .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .

A high degree of understanding at the level of leadership and the traditional mutual respect of our peoples has established a lasting basis for the development of mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation on new and equitable bases .  
Our Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , also deserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and just and sustained by an equitable economic order .  
To erect barriers in this regard is incompatible with the objective of establishing a new and equitable international order for stable peace and common security and for economic and social justice .  
Such efforts , encouraged and supported by sustained bilateral and multilateral assistance , could pave the way for broader and more ambitious schemes for regional cooperation on an equitable basis .  
If properly designed and operated , national environmental funds can play a catalytic role in improving environmental management , biodiversity conservation , and sustainable and equitable use of natural resources .

Given the deepening and growing interdependence of nations and peoples , we are fully conscious of the fact that a dynamic , vigorous and equitable international economic environment is essential for international peace , security , stability and prosperity .

The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
Therefore , in order to be effective and equitable , international cooperation should be applied on the basis of mutual respect and benefit , without politicizing the problems of economic and social development and without strings attached .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .  When speaking of these qualities , one is inclined to ponder the work on the reform of the Security Council .  
This is true not only for the economic and social sectors , but also for the reform of the Security Council , which is already the subject of a detailed Italian proposal inspired by the principles of democracy , equitable geographical representation and efficiency . 
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
We call upon the international community to contribute fully to the definition and implementation of the new role of the United Nations , which undoubtedly is of a humanitarian nature , and aims at protecting and preserving life on our planet and at raising the standard of living of all peoples , through the establishment of a new , balanced and equitable international economic and social order .  
To erect barriers in this regard is incompatible with the objective of establishing a new and more equitable international order for stable peace and for economic and social justice .  
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
The desire expressed by the Members of the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council will become reality if we make the Council as representative an organ as possible , reflecting the universal character of the United Nations and including within it the greatest possible variety of interests and views , and if we adopt , as guiding principles to that end , those of the sovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical distribution , as provided in the Charter .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
At a time when the international order has lost its regulatory capability and the international community lacks the frames of reference that could help guide its action , it is up to the United Nations to regulate inter-State relations , to promote a stable and equitable order and to foster a model that would be acceptable to all .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
It is our hope that the informal consultations to be held later this week will lead to workable solutions concerning the election of 36 members of the Council of the International Seabed Authority , comprising four groups representing the various interests in seabed mining , plus 18 members to be elected in accordance with the principal legal systems of the world and equitable geographical distribution , in accordance with article 161 of the Convention .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .  
National development policies must be designed to promote economic growth , social justice and concern for the environment ; at the same time , the international community must establish more equitable economic relations , bearing in mind the importance of protecting the global environment .

Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the continuous and major publications of the Department of Public Information [ 4 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that its output contains adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
As to paragraph 6 , in which Iraq was accused of impeding the equitable distribution of foodstuffs among the regions , it was completely divorced from reality as clearly reflected in independent international reports ; the latter were eloquent in their praises of the system whereby provisions were delivered to the north , as well as to the centre and the south , without any discrimination . 
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
[ We believe that attaining these goals will promote a world more stable and free from injustice and conflict and contribute to just , comprehensive and lasting peace and to global equitable economic and social development and environmental protection . ]  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
Using resources and economic instruments in an effective , efficient and equitable manner at the local , national , regional and international levels ;  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Recalling also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
He suggested that it should be formulated as a draft resolution , for ultimate adoption by the General Assembly , entitled Draft principles governing the rational and equitable use of the geostationary orbit and arranged in the same way as the existing four sets of outer space principles adopted by the General Assembly .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
By resolution 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , the General Assembly decided that the governing body of the United Nations Children 's Fund should be transformed into an Executive Board , and that the Executive Board should have 36 members , to be elected with due regard to equitable geographical representation and other relevant factors with a view to ensuring the most effective and broadest representation .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the review of publications by the Department of Public Information [ 1 ] / and urges all efforts be made to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The principle of equitable and reasonable utilization laid down in article 5 has an axiomatic element : it declares that , while the right of a State to utilize the waters of an international watercourse in its own territory is an attribute of sovereignty , the inherent limit on that right , which must be spelled out in watercourse agreements , is the equal and concomitant right of other watercourse States to utilize and benefit from that watercourse .  
In other words , the regulation provided in article 7 is satisfactory neither to the State planning a new activity ( since it will be held liable for any harm caused even though the activity may constitute equitable and reasonable utilization ) nor to the State suffering harm from this activity ( which is entitled only to consultations if the first State has exercised due diligence ) .  
In the light of the above , it is considered that the provision of exchange of information and consultations only in the case of water utilization liable to cause significant harm would be sufficient in respect of satisfying the criteria of equitable and reasonable utilization of international watercourses .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
As I stated in my letter dated 6 June 1996 to the President of the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 956 ) , the parties agreed on a broad array of measures to permit wider participation in decision-making at all levels ; to increase and redirect government spending towards social development ; to promote a more efficient and equitable agrarian structure ; to modernize public administration ; and to produce a sustained increase in public revenue .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1985 / 17 , the Committee has 18 members who are experts with recognized competence in the field of human rights , serving in their personal capacity , due consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of different forms of social and legal systems ; to this end , 15 seats are equally distributed among the regional groups , while the additional 3 seats are allocated in accordance with the increase in the total number of States parties per regional group .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Despite the continuing invasion and occupation of a substantial part of its territory , Cyprus was a sponsor of various useful meetings and seminars dealing with a wide range of economic and development issues , and , in that connection , his delegation agreed that a " new and equitable partnership " must be based on equality and that economic cooperation for development must be the central objective of that process .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
The attainment of that objective required good governance , which could be defined as government that was honest , open and equitable , that provided public institutions which were stable , responsive and reliable and that was transparent , representative , accountable and restrained .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 6 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
But security on this dual level will remain an unattained and unattainable dream so long as the major goal has not been achieved or rather , so long as the first sine qua non condition has not been fulfilled : equitable power sharing providing the necessary balance among national communities .  
Like other members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , his country supported the concept of a rapidly deployable headquarters team and emphasized the importance of such a team being set up in a transparent manner , bearing in mind the multilateral character of the Organization and the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations as it pertained to the independence of the staff and to equitable geographical distribution . 
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity , and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights . "  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights " ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;

Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
In the composition of subsidiary organs , emphasis shall be placed on the need for members qualified and competent in relevant technical matters dealt with by those organs , provided that due account shall be taken of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and of special interests .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
The increasing use of water during the early decades of the century had made it necessary to address the quantitative aspects of harmful effects ; to that end , the concept of equitable and reasonable use had come to the fore as a normative standard .  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,

Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
This is intended to lead to more rational , transparent and effective recruitment , placement and promotion strategies that take into account existing staff profiles and potential , and target recruitment and staff development needs to take into account , in particular , equitable geographical distribution and gender balance requirements .  
It is indisputably one of the major achievements of the United Nations and has come to be regarded as a multilateral instrument that holds out great promise and vast potential for the maintenance of peace , an equitable basis for sharing the resources of the world 's oceans and a means for securing economic and social progress for all the peoples of the Earth .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
The Government of Guatemala reiterates that the incorporation of URNG in the political and legal life of the country , under conditions of security and dignity , is in the national interest , given that it is directly related to the objective of reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic system open to all , and to the contribution of all Guatemalans in building a prosperous country , a just and equitable socio-economic system and a multicultural , multiethnic and multilingual nation ,  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Thirdly , since the draft Convention sets out a framework regime that lays down general rules intended to promote equitable and reasonable cooperation between downstream and upstream States in the use of international watercourses , and in the hope that its implementation will make a genuine contribution to the progressive development of international law , the Slovak Republic is in a position to vote in favour of the draft framework Convention .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
Reviewing the past and looking to the future , people throughout the world are anxiously waiting for the establishment of a just and equitable new international political and economic order , and they are hoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in the coming century .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Nevertheless , there is now a strong signal to developed countries to commit at the upcoming Kyoto meeting on climate change to legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for greenhouse gas emissions .  
Any dialogue on fresh water should be based first and foremost on the acceptance and recognition of the relevant universally recognized principles of international law , in particular the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization of water resources .  
Whereas building a democratic , multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , with social justice , calls for equitable participation by all citizens , both men and women , on the basis of complete political and ideological pluralism ,  
These tasks are also dictated by the increase in the membership of the Organization , by the full application of the principles of sovereign equality and equitable geographical representation based on the Organization 's universal nature , and by the recognition that the United Nations remains a viable alternative for Member States .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
In accordance with article III of the statute of the Institute , the Board of Trustees is composed of 11 members nominated by States and appointed by the Economic and Social Council , with due regard to the fact that the Institute and its work are funded from voluntary contributions and to the principle of equitable geographical distribution .  
The general thrust of this recommendation , namely , the need for more active involvement of national NGOs in the country 's economic and social development , is strongly supported by ACC members , since all the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , especially those with operational activities , are well aware of all the benefits of NGO contributions to building equitable and stable societies . 
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The Working Group was informed that the fifth preambular paragraph recalled the fact that the a priori allocation plans adopted by the ITU administrative radio conferences guaranteed equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit and the radio frequencies for direct broadcasting satellite and fixed satellite services . 
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at UNCED and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
International Corporations should negotiate with the indigenous communities a just and fair profit _ sharing arrangement , prior to signing of any kind of agreement , and with full disclosure of the projected profit and complete development plans for the relevant project , to ensure that the peoples concerned receive an equitable profit share and / or compensation package .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment both at the national and the international level ,  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
Moreover , the concept of food security must stress such components as the production of a sufficient amount of food , a stable supply throughout the year , access to food for all , a proper and equitable distribution , and a commitment to producing the components of a balanced and healthy diet in keeping with local nutritional practices .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is already widespread but not universal agreement that it will be necessary to consider legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for countries listed in annex I to the Convention that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames , such as 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
All the endeavours to establish a new , just and equitable economic world order , free of humiliating conditions and restrictive and onerous practices , are brutally challenged by a powerful minority that reserves the worst and cruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet . 
But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
The United Nations , as a special and irreplaceable place for 185 States to meet , work together and cooperate , must lay down rules of law recognized universally by all so that international relations can continue in a coherent , equitable and efficient manner .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
In addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of peace and security , this paramount international body must be equipped and strengthened to do more in framing international treaties and standards and in encouraging international norms and practices that will bring about equitable economic development and social justice for all peoples .  
At the same time , these anti-poverty strategies are to be defined and implemented in the larger context of creating an environment that encourages and supports equitable , broad-based economic growth and social development at both the national and international levels .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The Sub-Commission considered that it would be useful for the Commission to establish , for a three _ year period , a Working Group composed of five experts nominated by Governments , to be appointed by the Chairman of the Commission at its fifty _ third session on the basis of equitable geographical representation and in consultation with the regional groups in the Commission , with the following mandate :  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
States should cooperate in facilitating more rational and equitable international economic relations and in encouraging structural changes in the context of a balanced economy in harmony with the needs and interests of all countries , especially developing countries , and should take appropriate measures to this end .  
Decides to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for a period of 10 working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to : 
Considers that it is necessary , within the ongoing process of the restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights , to take urgent , concrete and immediate steps to change the prevailing distribution of posts of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights in favour of an equitable geographical distribution of those posts in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter , particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries , including to key posts ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is already widespread but not universal agreement that it will be necessary to consider legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for countries listed in annex I to the Convention that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames , such as 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
While it was currently agreed that economic globalization and the laws of the market had become the new rules of the game , the conditions in which the game was played were far from equitable and had aggravated the economic disparities between developed and developing countries .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable , pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute to peace and development as well as to the establishment of a fair and equitable new international political and economic order .  
An integrated approach to the efficient and equitable development and allocation of water resources requires the use of economic and regulatory instruments designed to maximize social net benefits .  
The sides reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to deepening friendly , equitable and mutually advantageous relations based on a long-term partnership and consistent with the national interests of all five States , and to security and stability in the region .  
Committed to the full development of human potential within just and inclusive societies attentive to the promotion of harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups ;  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
Recognizing that human rights were universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , the international community as a whole should strive towards a fair and equitable promotion and implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
The greatest challenge faced by Haiti was to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic and equitable judicial system available to all .

As the expert had already observed , the greatest challenge faced by Haiti is to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable judicial system available to all .

He urged the international community to establish a rule-based , equitable and transparent multilateral trading system and said that he hoped that the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations would promote development , eliminate trade barriers against developing countries and increase preferential treatment to promote the financing of development through trade .  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .

The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
We have also realized that the creation of a better , more equitable world ensuring equal opportunities for all people requires stable economic policies , longterm social programmes and concerted international action .

The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .

There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .

Noting that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
However , favourable external conditions were equally necessary ; the current international economic system must be reformed to meet the challenges of globalization and growing interdependence among countries and made more equitable by increasing the decision-making power of the developing countries .

This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .

They stressed the necessity [ English version uses " need " ] to establish an equitable , just , fair and reasonable new international political and economic order that is free of hegemonism and power politics and is based on equality .  They indicated their readiness to work together for the establishment of such a new order .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
He said that the following three basic principles must be stressed in establishing a new international and economic order that is peaceful , stable , equitable and just : First , all countries , big or small , should be treated as equal .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : In the 21st century , China will continue to resolutely and unwaveringly uphold the reform and opening-up policy and pursue an independent foreign policy of peace .

" To achieve this aim , the health care system must be able to protect and promote the health of the community ; to provide comprehensive and lifelong holistic care to each individual ; to offer accessible , equitable and quality services to each patient , and at the same time to remain cost effective , sustainable and affordable .  
To achieve this aim , the health care system must be able to protect and promote the health of the community ; to provide comprehensive and lifelong holistic care to each individual ; to offer accessible , equitable and quality services to each patient , and at the same time to remain cost effective , sustainable and affordable .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .  
China has successfully withstood external political pressure and has scored rapid economic development , he said , adding that it has a traditional friendship with other developing countries and supports them in their demand for a just and equitable international economic order , and is providing assistance in funds and technology to them  
" The Chinese government and people are ready to work with all other governments and peoples of the world to make their due contribution to establishing a peaceful , stable , just and equitable new international political and economic order and to promoting the lofty cause of world peace and development , " he concluded  
A high degree of understanding at the level of leadership and the traditional mutual respect of our peoples has established a lasting basis for the development of mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation on new and equitable bases .  
Our Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , also deserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and just and sustained by an equitable economic order .  
To erect barriers in this regard is incompatible with the objective of establishing a new and equitable international order for stable peace and common security and for economic and social justice .  
Such efforts , encouraged and supported by sustained bilateral and multilateral assistance , could pave the way for broader and more ambitious schemes for regional cooperation on an equitable basis .  
If properly designed and operated , national environmental funds can play a catalytic role in improving environmental management , biodiversity conservation , and sustainable and equitable use of natural resources .

The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
Therefore , in order to be effective and equitable , international cooperation should be applied on the basis of mutual respect and benefit , without politicizing the problems of economic and social development and without strings attached .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .  When speaking of these qualities , one is inclined to ponder the work on the reform of the Security Council .  
This is true not only for the economic and social sectors , but also for the reform of the Security Council , which is already the subject of a detailed Italian proposal inspired by the principles of democracy , equitable geographical representation and efficiency . 
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
We call upon the international community to contribute fully to the definition and implementation of the new role of the United Nations , which undoubtedly is of a humanitarian nature , and aims at protecting and preserving life on our planet and at raising the standard of living of all peoples , through the establishment of a new , balanced and equitable international economic and social order .  
To erect barriers in this regard is incompatible with the objective of establishing a new and more equitable international order for stable peace and for economic and social justice .  
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
The desire expressed by the Members of the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council will become reality if we make the Council as representative an organ as possible , reflecting the universal character of the United Nations and including within it the greatest possible variety of interests and views , and if we adopt , as guiding principles to that end , those of the sovereign equality of States and of equitable geographical distribution , as provided in the Charter .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
At a time when the international order has lost its regulatory capability and the international community lacks the frames of reference that could help guide its action , it is up to the United Nations to regulate inter-State relations , to promote a stable and equitable order and to foster a model that would be acceptable to all .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
It is our hope that the informal consultations to be held later this week will lead to workable solutions concerning the election of 36 members of the Council of the International Seabed Authority , comprising four groups representing the various interests in seabed mining , plus 18 members to be elected in accordance with the principal legal systems of the world and equitable geographical distribution , in accordance with article 161 of the Convention .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .  
National development policies must be designed to promote economic growth , social justice and concern for the environment ; at the same time , the international community must establish more equitable economic relations , bearing in mind the importance of protecting the global environment .

We commit ourselves to attaining the goals of universal and equitable access to quality education and to basic health services , without distinction by race , national origin , gender or age , and to preserving and promoting our rich and varied cultural heritage , as indispensable bases for people-centred sustainable development .

The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
In developing the standards in appendix II , five principles were followed : ( a ) performance statements were made functional and not equipment-specific ; ( b ) fairness was achieved by establishing a high but equitable level of performance ; ( c ) a firm baseline for a minimum acceptable level of performance was set ; ( d ) the standards must themselves be verifiable in the mission area ; and ( e ) the standards must be at a level and expressed in terms that are acceptable to all Member States .

economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
MEKDAD ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had stated that all human rights were universal , interdependent and interconnected and that the international community should deal with human rights in a comprehensive , equitable and even-handed manner , while taking regional and cultural specificities into consideration .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , 6 / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the United Nations Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook , and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions where they occur ;  
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
While actively supporting the Commission , the Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts alone can not guarantee equitable security in the region if they are not paired with other effective and practical measures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there and to promote comprehensive and unconditional acceptance of international monitoring and inspection of all activities related to this matter .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
My country has assumed the responsibility to diminish poverty in the short term through social and economic strategies geared not only towards meeting basic physical needs such as health , nutrition , education and work , but which are also aimed at defending human rights and promoting the equitable distribution of income and wealth .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Urges Governments to promote and attain the goals of eradicating illiteracy , universal and equitable access to quality education , and the highest standard of physical and mental health , and to encourage international organizations , in particular the international financial institutions , to support these objectives and to integrate them into policy programmes and operations , as appropriate ;  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Furthermore , as the participants at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen had underscored , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as well the strengthening of democracy within the framework of equitable economic relations and a favourable international economic environment were an integral part of social development .  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,

Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the continuous and major publications of the Department of Public Information [ 4 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that its output contains adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
As to paragraph 6 , in which Iraq was accused of impeding the equitable distribution of foodstuffs among the regions , it was completely divorced from reality as clearly reflected in independent international reports ; the latter were eloquent in their praises of the system whereby provisions were delivered to the north , as well as to the centre and the south , without any discrimination . 
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
[ We believe that attaining these goals will promote a world more stable and free from injustice and conflict and contribute to just , comprehensive and lasting peace and to global equitable economic and social development and environmental protection . ]  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
Using resources and economic instruments in an effective , efficient and equitable manner at the local , national , regional and international levels ;  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Recalling also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
He suggested that it should be formulated as a draft resolution , for ultimate adoption by the General Assembly , entitled Draft principles governing the rational and equitable use of the geostationary orbit and arranged in the same way as the existing four sets of outer space principles adopted by the General Assembly .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
By resolution 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , the General Assembly decided that the governing body of the United Nations Children 's Fund should be transformed into an Executive Board , and that the Executive Board should have 36 members , to be elected with due regard to equitable geographical representation and other relevant factors with a view to ensuring the most effective and broadest representation .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the review of publications by the Department of Public Information [ 1 ] / and urges all efforts be made to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The principle of equitable and reasonable utilization laid down in article 5 has an axiomatic element : it declares that , while the right of a State to utilize the waters of an international watercourse in its own territory is an attribute of sovereignty , the inherent limit on that right , which must be spelled out in watercourse agreements , is the equal and concomitant right of other watercourse States to utilize and benefit from that watercourse .  
In other words , the regulation provided in article 7 is satisfactory neither to the State planning a new activity ( since it will be held liable for any harm caused even though the activity may constitute equitable and reasonable utilization ) nor to the State suffering harm from this activity ( which is entitled only to consultations if the first State has exercised due diligence ) .  
In the light of the above , it is considered that the provision of exchange of information and consultations only in the case of water utilization liable to cause significant harm would be sufficient in respect of satisfying the criteria of equitable and reasonable utilization of international watercourses .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
As I stated in my letter dated 6 June 1996 to the President of the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 956 ) , the parties agreed on a broad array of measures to permit wider participation in decision-making at all levels ; to increase and redirect government spending towards social development ; to promote a more efficient and equitable agrarian structure ; to modernize public administration ; and to produce a sustained increase in public revenue .  
In accordance with Council resolution 1985 / 17 , the Committee has 18 members who are experts with recognized competence in the field of human rights , serving in their personal capacity , due consideration being given to equitable geographical distribution and to the representation of different forms of social and legal systems ; to this end , 15 seats are equally distributed among the regional groups , while the additional 3 seats are allocated in accordance with the increase in the total number of States parties per regional group .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
They reaffirmed that the Convention and the agreements represented significant achievements of the international community through multilateral efforts in creating a legal order for the seas and the oceans that will , inter alia , facilitate international communications , promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans , the equitable and efficient utilization of their resources , the conservation of their living resources and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Despite the continuing invasion and occupation of a substantial part of its territory , Cyprus was a sponsor of various useful meetings and seminars dealing with a wide range of economic and development issues , and , in that connection , his delegation agreed that a " new and equitable partnership " must be based on equality and that economic cooperation for development must be the central objective of that process .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
The attainment of that objective required good governance , which could be defined as government that was honest , open and equitable , that provided public institutions which were stable , responsive and reliable and that was transparent , representative , accountable and restrained .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 6 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
But security on this dual level will remain an unattained and unattainable dream so long as the major goal has not been achieved or rather , so long as the first sine qua non condition has not been fulfilled : equitable power sharing providing the necessary balance among national communities .  
Like other members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , his country supported the concept of a rapidly deployable headquarters team and emphasized the importance of such a team being set up in a transparent manner , bearing in mind the multilateral character of the Organization and the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations as it pertained to the independence of the staff and to equitable geographical distribution . 
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity , and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights . "  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
" Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights " ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
In the composition of subsidiary organs , emphasis shall be placed on the need for members qualified and competent in relevant technical matters dealt with by those organs , provided that due account shall be taken of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and of special interests .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
The increasing use of water during the early decades of the century had made it necessary to address the quantitative aspects of harmful effects ; to that end , the concept of equitable and reasonable use had come to the fore as a normative standard .  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,

It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
This is intended to lead to more rational , transparent and effective recruitment , placement and promotion strategies that take into account existing staff profiles and potential , and target recruitment and staff development needs to take into account , in particular , equitable geographical distribution and gender balance requirements .  
It is indisputably one of the major achievements of the United Nations and has come to be regarded as a multilateral instrument that holds out great promise and vast potential for the maintenance of peace , an equitable basis for sharing the resources of the world 's oceans and a means for securing economic and social progress for all the peoples of the Earth .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
The Government of Guatemala reiterates that the incorporation of URNG in the political and legal life of the country , under conditions of security and dignity , is in the national interest , given that it is directly related to the objective of reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic system open to all , and to the contribution of all Guatemalans in building a prosperous country , a just and equitable socio-economic system and a multicultural , multiethnic and multilingual nation ,  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Thirdly , since the draft Convention sets out a framework regime that lays down general rules intended to promote equitable and reasonable cooperation between downstream and upstream States in the use of international watercourses , and in the hope that its implementation will make a genuine contribution to the progressive development of international law , the Slovak Republic is in a position to vote in favour of the draft framework Convention .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
Reviewing the past and looking to the future , people throughout the world are anxiously waiting for the establishment of a just and equitable new international political and economic order , and they are hoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in the coming century .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Nevertheless , there is now a strong signal to developed countries to commit at the upcoming Kyoto meeting on climate change to legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for greenhouse gas emissions .  
Any dialogue on fresh water should be based first and foremost on the acceptance and recognition of the relevant universally recognized principles of international law , in particular the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization of water resources .  
Whereas building a democratic , multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , with social justice , calls for equitable participation by all citizens , both men and women , on the basis of complete political and ideological pluralism ,  
These tasks are also dictated by the increase in the membership of the Organization , by the full application of the principles of sovereign equality and equitable geographical representation based on the Organization 's universal nature , and by the recognition that the United Nations remains a viable alternative for Member States .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
In accordance with article III of the statute of the Institute , the Board of Trustees is composed of 11 members nominated by States and appointed by the Economic and Social Council , with due regard to the fact that the Institute and its work are funded from voluntary contributions and to the principle of equitable geographical distribution .  
The general thrust of this recommendation , namely , the need for more active involvement of national NGOs in the country 's economic and social development , is strongly supported by ACC members , since all the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , especially those with operational activities , are well aware of all the benefits of NGO contributions to building equitable and stable societies . 
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The Working Group was informed that the fifth preambular paragraph recalled the fact that the a priori allocation plans adopted by the ITU administrative radio conferences guaranteed equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit and the radio frequencies for direct broadcasting satellite and fixed satellite services . 
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at UNCED and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
International Corporations should negotiate with the indigenous communities a just and fair profit _ sharing arrangement , prior to signing of any kind of agreement , and with full disclosure of the projected profit and complete development plans for the relevant project , to ensure that the peoples concerned receive an equitable profit share and / or compensation package .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment both at the national and the international level ,  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
Moreover , the concept of food security must stress such components as the production of a sufficient amount of food , a stable supply throughout the year , access to food for all , a proper and equitable distribution , and a commitment to producing the components of a balanced and healthy diet in keeping with local nutritional practices .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is already widespread but not universal agreement that it will be necessary to consider legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for countries listed in annex I to the Convention that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames , such as 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
All the endeavours to establish a new , just and equitable economic world order , free of humiliating conditions and restrictive and onerous practices , are brutally challenged by a powerful minority that reserves the worst and cruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet . 
But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
The United Nations , as a special and irreplaceable place for 185 States to meet , work together and cooperate , must lay down rules of law recognized universally by all so that international relations can continue in a coherent , equitable and efficient manner .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
In addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of peace and security , this paramount international body must be equipped and strengthened to do more in framing international treaties and standards and in encouraging international norms and practices that will bring about equitable economic development and social justice for all peoples .  
At the same time , these anti-poverty strategies are to be defined and implemented in the larger context of creating an environment that encourages and supports equitable , broad-based economic growth and social development at both the national and international levels .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The Sub-Commission considered that it would be useful for the Commission to establish , for a three _ year period , a Working Group composed of five experts nominated by Governments , to be appointed by the Chairman of the Commission at its fifty _ third session on the basis of equitable geographical representation and in consultation with the regional groups in the Commission , with the following mandate :  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
States should cooperate in facilitating more rational and equitable international economic relations and in encouraging structural changes in the context of a balanced economy in harmony with the needs and interests of all countries , especially developing countries , and should take appropriate measures to this end .  
Decides to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for a period of 10 working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to : 
Considers that it is necessary , within the ongoing process of the restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights , to take urgent , concrete and immediate steps to change the prevailing distribution of posts of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights in favour of an equitable geographical distribution of those posts in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter , particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries , including to key posts ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is already widespread but not universal agreement that it will be necessary to consider legally binding , meaningful , realistic and equitable targets for countries listed in annex I to the Convention that will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames , such as 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
While it was currently agreed that economic globalization and the laws of the market had become the new rules of the game , the conditions in which the game was played were far from equitable and had aggravated the economic disparities between developed and developing countries .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable , pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute to peace and development as well as to the establishment of a fair and equitable new international political and economic order .  
An integrated approach to the efficient and equitable development and allocation of water resources requires the use of economic and regulatory instruments designed to maximize social net benefits .  
The sides reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to deepening friendly , equitable and mutually advantageous relations based on a long-term partnership and consistent with the national interests of all five States , and to security and stability in the region .

Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .

It adopted the Istanbul Declaration , in which the nations present endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more liveable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
Because people are inspired by ideas , empowered by knowledge , and moved to change by greater understanding , WRI provides and helps other institutions provide objective information and practical proposals for policy and institutional change that will foster environmentally sound , socially equitable development .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
To respect fully all the rights of individuals in Kosovo , whatever their ethnic , cultural or religious backgrounds , so as to guarantee equitable treatment of their values and historic patrimony and so as to preserve and permit expression of their national , cultural , religious and linguistic identities in accordance with international standards and the Final Act of Helsinki of 1 August 1975 ;  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
Reiterating that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and should be promoted and implemented in a fair and equitable manner , without prejudice to the implementation of each of those rights and freedoms ,  
UNIDO harnesses the joint forces of government and the private sector to foster competitive industrial production , develop international industrial partnerships and promote socially equitable and environmentally friendly industrial development .  UNIDO is the only worldwide organization dealing with industry from a development perspective .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination of the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments ;  
While coherent and well-focused government efforts remain an integral element of social development framework , involvement of civil society and private sector proves to be highly beneficial for attaining both specific social targets and equitable development . 
South / South cooperation , including TCDC and ECDC , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their more effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system .

Requests the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination of the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments ;  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;

The central theme of this review that population concerns are an indispensable part of national and international efforts to achieve equitable , sustained development is particularly relevant to small island developing States , such as Jamaica and many in the Caribbean .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
By section V , paragraph 22 , of its resolution 53 / 221 of 7 April 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bio-ethics , bio-safety , bio-diversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment . 
Given its cooperation and pragmatism during this entire process , commencing with its initiative that led to the 5 May 1999 Agreements , Indonesia has agreed to the expansion of various components of UNAMET , based upon the principle of equitable geographical representation , in the interim phase , in order to maintain its international and impartial character .  
Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
He also stressed that the greatest challenge faced by Haiti is to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic and equitable judicial system that is available to all .  
The fruit that our peace process has manifestly borne in such a short time provides clear evidence of the validity and relevance of the system and of the fundamental , indispensable and inestimable importance of the efforts of the Guatemalan people within the country and of the unquestionable effectiveness of international friendship in the form of respectful , timely and effective cooperation in building a more democratic country and a more equitable and united world .  
Our country is pursuing in practice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view to establishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral relations with all the countries of the world and to strengthening international security and stability .  
Efforts must be made to harmonize economic and social development , achieve a more equitable distribution of income , promote gender equity and implement proactive social policies , with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable groups , such as children , women , the disabled , the elderly , indigenous persons and the unemployed .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
On a broader front , meaningful partnership requires more inclusive and democratic institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making which would ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis .  
Mindful of the potential opportunities and risks inherent in the globalization process , the States members of UNCTAD commit themselves to engage in a true partnership for development designed to promote a dynamic and equitable global economic environment .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of developing countries on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
The Ministers at Marrakech had also agreed to transmit a message to the WTO Conference in Seattle , demonstrating the G-77s determination to ensure that future multilateral trade initiatives would be focused on achieving a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the global trading system , improving conditions of access for developing country products and services in world markets and correcting imbalances in rights and obligations .  
His own Government was committed to pursuing economic development within the framework of democratic institutions and human rights and was convinced that democracy was the only path towards fair and equitable development .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
He hoped that national and international efforts would be redoubled to ensure that the deliberations at the 2002 quinquennial review and appraisal of the World Programme of Action adequately reflected the issues that must be addressed in the areas of social integration , technology , information and comprehensive protection to guarantee equitable development for the disabled in the new millennium .  
Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict , with freely elected Governments in each country and with profound political , economic , social and other changes which have created a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic , just and equitable societies ,  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;

Given those circumstances , the ministers for foreign affairs of the Group of 77 had emphasized at the meeting held in New York on 24 September 1999 that , while globalization was often unpredictable and uneven , it could , if properly managed and based on strengthened cooperation , open the way for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels .

In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at Durban in September 1998 stressed that the expansion and reform of the Security Council must be an indivisible part of a common and complementary process that takes into account the principles of sovereign equality among States and equitable geographic distribution , as well as the need for transparency , accountability and democracy in the working methods of the Security Council , including decision-making therein .  
Our purpose is to improve the quality of life of average and low income earners and to encourage equitable distribution of goods and services in the economic and social sector without excluding the customary and traditional values observed by communities , and to integrate programmes and activities in a manageable manner to ensure that strong community participation , commitment and ownership in various development areas can and will continue to be sustained .  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment ;

Renews its commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
Requests the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination of the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary arrangements ;  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
During its first session , the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development recognized the crucial role played by small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in stimulating broad-based , equitable and sustainable development , as well as the role of the changing global economic environment and the pressures this puts on SMEs .  
Globalization is a process which can be uneven and unpredictable , but if it is properly harnessed and managed , the foundations for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels can be laid .  
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .  
Mr . Sareva ( Finland ) , speaking on behalf of the European Union , the associated countries Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Malta , Romania and Slovenia and , in addition , Iceland , said that it was necessary to devise a more equitable , stable , simple and transparent scale of assessments based on reliable , verifiable and comparable data and reflecting each Member States real capacity to pay .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Emphasizing the fact that the realization of the right to development requires effective and efficient development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
He urged the international community to establish a rule-based , equitable and transparent multilateral trading system and said that he hoped that the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations would promote development , eliminate trade barriers against developing countries and increase preferential treatment to promote the financing of development through trade .  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
We have also realized that the creation of a better , more equitable world ensuring equal opportunities for all people requires stable economic policies , longterm social programmes and concerted international action .  
In the end , the Group of 77 agreed that globalization is a process which can be uneven and unpredictable , but that if it is properly harnessed and managed , the foundations for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels can be laid . 
Let us recommit to accelerate social progress worldwide through a more enabling national environment enhanced by fair , just and equitable relations among the members of our global family .  The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m .  
SADC was firmly resolved to reduce poverty through sustained and broadbased economic growth and equitable distribution of social services , but the enormous burden of external debt inhibited the full economic and social development of the region . 
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .  
Such partnership requires more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decisionmaking so as to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis .  
To that end , the currently unworkable international financial system should be converted into a rational and sound system , and the multilateral trading system should be reformed in order to make it equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory and predictable .  
A peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication as well as sustainable and equitable development ;

Policy and institutional reforms to create a sound socioeconomic and political environment to transform the social and productive basis for development into one in which sustainable , equitable and genderbalanced development can take place .  
The creation of a just , equitable and nondiscriminatory international economic environment that is conducive to social development and sensitive to the needs of the poor is urgently required .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable .

It is a nonprofit , nonsectarian secular body of vigilant women committed to the establishment of a just , equitable and humane social order in which men and women will participate on an equal footing in a harmonious relationship .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
Expansion of the membership must be responsive to the changed global political and economic climate , reflecting the new realities in the global arena and respecting the principles of sovereign equality among all States and equitable geographical distribution .  
Regarding commercial debt of LDCs , orderly and equitable workout procedures should be established , with explicit responsibilities of creditors and debtors and clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ( see General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 , para .  5 ) .  
Of critical importance is a fair , equitable and rulesbased multilateral trading system , operating in a nondiscriminatory , inclusive and transparent manner that provides benefits for all countries , especially developing countries .  
Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .

Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  10 .

The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
Express our firm conviction that the development of democratic systems of government in Africa , which guarantee full access and representation of all sectors of our societies , respect for and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , equitable distribution of wealth and access to economic advancement , active promotion of peace , preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution and an equitable international economic environment , is an essential prerequisite for the prevention of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
A coherent SME policy framework is an essential component of a private sector development strategy where the primary objective is to create productive employment and foster equitable development .  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;

Taking note of the Bangkok Declaration adopted at the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( TD / 390 ) which asserted that solidarity and a strong sense of moral responsibility must be the guiding light of national and international policy and that more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making are required to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
In recognizing that there is a growing awareness of the positive impact of effective social policies on economic and social development , the special session stressed that social development requires , inter alia , not only economic activity , but also a reduction in inequality in the distribution of wealth and more equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth within and among nations .  
Recognizing also that accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is one of the central elements of any effective remedy for victims of human rights violations and a key factor in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and , ultimately , reconciliation and stability within a State ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Taking note of the Bangkok Declaration adopted at the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( TD / 390 ) which asserted that solidarity and a strong sense of moral responsibility must be the guiding light of national and international policy and that more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making are required to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purpose of preparing a version of the revised draft elements of responsible crime prevention2 and proposing priorities for international action , including areas for technical assistance , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
The overall objective of improving public sector performance for the delivery of services in LDCs can only be accomplished through the creation of an enabling environment which will ensure effective resource utilization and partnership-building , promote effective society - wide participation and sustain the rule-of-law and equitable distribution of wealth .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 2 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 7 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ;  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
Development partners agreed to effectively implement the enhanced HIPC Initiative and provide adequate financial resources expeditiously for the speedy and full implementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , and provide new and additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative , on the basis of fair and equitable burden-sharing .
