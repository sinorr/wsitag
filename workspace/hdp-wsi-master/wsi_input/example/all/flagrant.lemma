This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
The Working Group was further gravely concerned in regard to that case by communications regarding particularly inhuman punishment , including women being beaten for disobedience , tortured , shot , burnt alive and sprayed with acid , which constitutes flagrant violation of the right to life .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
The basis for the Security Council 's action is , above all , the recognition that flagrant , grave and systematic violations of universally accepted international humanitarian and human rights law may pose a real threat to international peace and security .  
The Declaration emphasizes the important role of international cooperation for , and the valuable work of individuals , groups and associations in contributing to , the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals , including in relation to mass , flagrant or systematic violations of human rights .  
The ongoing series of hostile operations and the flagrant violations of Iraqs territory and airspace that are being committed by the Turkish armed forces only confirm Iraqs repeated warnings against the consequences of the duplicitous policy being pursued by Turkey vis - - vis the anomalous situation in northern Iraq and against Turkeys participation in perpetuating that situation by open interference in the internal affairs of Iraq .  
Reiterates its condemnation of the killing of Iranian diplomats and the correspondent of the Islamic Republic News Agency by the Taliban , which constituted flagrant violations of established international law , as well as of the attacks on and killing of United Nations personnel in Taliban-held territories of Afghanistan , and calls upon the Taliban to fulfil its stated commitment to cooperate in urgent investigations of these heinous crimes and to bring those responsible to justice ;  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
The time has come for the United Nations to have its say on the matter of this aggression , which is in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and whose victims comprise some hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded among the innocent civilian population , to say nothing of the deliberate destruction of the infrastructure that is vital to the economy and to everyday life in Iraq .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;  
Such wanton aggression on the part of the United States and the United Kingdom not only constitutes a serious violation of Iraqs sovereignty and territorial integrity and endangers the lives and safety of a large number of innocent civilians but also represents a flagrant and deliberate violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law and a genuine threat to international peace and security created by two countries that are permanent members of the Security Council .  
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
This illegal action , which was authorized by the Israeli high court , aims to alter the legal status and the religious and cultural character of Occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 . 
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
The adoption of laws encouraging the use of unilateral coercive economic measures in order to achieve political objectives constitutes a flagrant violation of the rules of international law , particularly the principles , objectives and rules governing trade among nations .  
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
Israels possession of excessive quantities of weapons , its stupendous arsenal of highly destructive and unconventional weapons and its categorical refusal to place its nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards constitute a flagrant challenge to the international community .  
There was no doubt that the brutal imposition of comprehensive sanctions , exacting vengeance on an entire people , were a continuing flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter , of international law and of international humanitarian law .  
This campaign , which is being conducted in grave and flagrant violation of signed commitments reached between Israel and the Palestinian leadership , and which represents a dangerous departure from the spirit and the letter of the Middle East peace process , is the direct result of the relentless incitement in the official Palestinian media , the collusion between the Palestinian leadership and recognized terrorist groups , and the release of scores of terrorists from Palestinian prisons . 
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .  
Regardless of the strong protest of the Chinese Government , the US Government announced on 23 April its decision to sell Taiwan several billion US dollars ' worth of advanced weapons , including " Kidd-class " destroyers , diesel-power submarines , and P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft .  This move taken by the US government is a flagrant breach of the principles stated in the three Sino-US joint communiques that the US Government has repeatedly committed itself to ;  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
A country divided and ravaged by incessant war , corruption in politics , and economic backwardness - - this is the image a chronically poor and weak China projected in the 1930s ; this is also an important reason why Japanese militarists dared to launch a war of aggression against China in a flagrant manner .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
For 20 months we have been spectators helpless spectators of aggression , territorial conquest , " ethnic cleansing " , intolerance of every kind , and continuing massive , flagrant , systematic violations of human rights .  
The flagrant disregard for basic human rights and international humanitarian law is continuing to expand the range of human suffering , often placing fragile political and social structures in neighbouring regions and countries under unbearable pressure .  
Expressing once again its grave concern at the continuing reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including acts of genocide , have been committed in Rwanda ,  
Expressing once again its grave concern at the continuing reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including acts of genocide , have been committed in Rwanda ,  
For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights . "  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .

On the other hand , it is ironic that a mentality which has attempted to annex the whole island and continues to entertain irredentist designs on Cyprus , in flagrant violation of international law and all norms governing peaceful relations among nations , can feel eligible to interfere with and complain about proposed amendments to existing legislation in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus regarding utilization and ownership of property in the North .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq was accompanied by flagrant violations committed by the invading forces through intensive utilization of weapons that were not commensurate with the number of those who were subjected to the military campaign , in which military aircraft and heavy military equipment were used , causing great damage to property and killing Iraqi Kurdish citizens .

In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .
