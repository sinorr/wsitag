It was learned that , the national project of new medicines and industrialized development , jointly promoted by departments of the State Science Commission , the Ministry of Public Health , the State Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau , etc . , is now being implemented .  By the end of this century , ten new patent protected medicines are planned to be developed and five new medicine selecting centers , five medication safety assessing centers and five medication clinic experimentation centers will be built .  
More gratifyingly and admiringly , since the proposal on innovations initiated by the Sixth CPV National Congress in 1986 , Vietnam has made new and tremendous achievements in socialist construction , its politics and society have remained stable , its economy has developed rapidly , the feature of the country has changed remarkably , the people 's lives have gradually improved , and its international position has enhanced , thus entering a new historic period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .  
Hu Jintao said : Since its founding , the Communist Party of Vietnam has always adhered to and upheld Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chih Ming Thought , maintained the leadership of the Communist Party , firmly kept to the path of socialism , triumphantly realized national liberation and reunification , scored remarkable achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform over the past 15 years , and led the Vietnamese people into a new historical period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
He pointed out that biotechnology is a critical area that will have bearing on national development in the 21st century , and it is also a new growth point for economic development , so we must concentrate our strengths and tackle key problems , accelerating the effort to come up with a group of scientific research achievements at advanced world levels and also speeding up the pace at which scientific research is transformed into results and becomes industrialized .  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .  
To follow the path of industrialized operation means to devote major efforts to advancing industrialized operation in cotton and encouraging cotton spinning enterprises to set up raw material production bases in cotton-producing areas and establish various forms of common interest communities with cotton farmers .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
The main grain producing areas must seize the opportunity of the expanded grain market space following the opening up of the sales areas , to meet market demands , optimize the grain variety composition , improve the quality , develop industrialized operations , and achieve the goal of increasing agricultural economic returns and peasant incomes .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
In the aspect of agriculture and rural areas , the regional party committee and government have actively readjusted the production structure of agriculture and on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study formulated the opinions of the autonomous region about readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure of agricultural products and pushing forward the industrialized operation of agriculture and proposed that farm production should focus on improving quality and uphold the unification of output , quality , structure , and effectiveness .  
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
Under the precondition of stabilizing farming output and never loosening grain production , we shall make full use of Shaanxi 's unique and abundant natural resources , mainly promote the industrialized production of fruits , especially apples , and promote the industrialization of animal farming , mainly , the indoor raising of sheep and cattle .  
As stressed at the session , strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing the farmers ' income must be considered as economic tasks of prime importance .  It is imperative to speed up agricultural and rural economic restructuring , energetically promote the industrialized operation of agriculture , vigorously conduct rural reforms in all fields , truly reduce the burdens on farmers , continue the help-the-poor work in rural areas , and take positive and steady steps to proceed with the urbanization program .  
As society has advanced , we have become more industrialized and urbanized . One consequence is that life has become more rushed , more hectic ; a slow , relaxing meal has become a luxury and " fast foods " have become all too common . In this " fast food society " , processed foods have gradually become a housewife 's best friend ; canned foods , frozen foods , and T . V . dinners are now found in almost every kitchen .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Tariffs have been cut on 3,500 categories of items , lowering the average effective tariff rate from 7.8 to approximately 5 percent , comparable to the rates in industrialized countries . Moreover , the New Taiwan dollar has been allowed to appreciate by more than 40 percent against the U . S . dollar since 1985 ; and private individuals can now buy as much as US $ 5 million for outward remittances .  
Under present circumstances , some areas can not be reported to you yet but there is one point that we should understand concerning the future development of the countries , centered around the newly industrialized countries . Viewed from the perspective of economic development , it is an undeniable fact that the center of the entire economy of the Pacific region has slowly shifted from the United States to the Western Pacific region , and the potential for the future development of economic power in this region is , in fact , fairly large .  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
Per Capita Income by the Year 2000By the year 2000 , the per capita gross national product in the Republic of China on Taiwan will exceed US $ 20,000 , a level comparable to per capita income in the highly industrialized countries of the West , and one which ranks her among the top twenty countries of the world . Estimates are that by that time the ROC 's foreign trade turnover will reach US $ 350 billion , which will make the ROC the tenth biggest trading country in the entire world .  
CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
In the past , refuse was invariably used for compost , burned or buried . Compost heaps have no place in an increasingly urban society , and open-air burning has been relinquished because of the air pollution it creates , but the growth of waste in a prosperous , industrialized nation is usually faster than that of the population .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
Santa Claus and the department stores team up to hoodwink innocent , trusting little children , and the original religious meaning of Christmas has been replaced by a superficial " eat , drink , and be merry " approach to the holidays . This has happened because industrialized society is pulling away from its agrarian roots .  
In recent years , every major meeting among industrialized nations having anything to do with economic globalization has been accompanied by rioting and protests . In particular , the huge riots in Seattle in 1999 have ignited a big upsurge in opposition to globalization . The G8 summit held this past July in Genoa , Italy was besieged by over 100,000 protesters .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
In terms of the international community , the level of financial support has consistently fallen short of requirements .  To a great extent this can be attributed to the economic difficulties experienced by industrialized countries in recent years .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
A specific aspect of this development especially worried the international community : the major troubled debtors were large , middleincome economies that owed the bulk of their debts to the top commercial banks of the key industrialized countries .  
Instead of coordinating their macroeconomic policies , however , the industrialized countries had sought to resolve their domestic problems in a purely national or restricted multilateral context .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
After the 1980s , which had been a lost decade for development , trends for the 1990s were not very encouraging : growing instability , uneven development , slow economic recovery and rising unemployment in the industrialized countries .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
We believe that the gap which exists , in the areas of economic growth and social advancement , between the wealthy industrialized countries , with their enormous economic resources , and the developing countries , is among the most chronic and significant problems that face the international community .  
However , our conscience can not rest easy in view of a reality that we can not ignore : the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject poverty , and the challenges posed by the enormous gap between the annual per capita gross national product for the least developed countries less than $ 200 and that of advanced industrialized countries , which is more than a-hundred times higher . 
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
Approximately 1.4-billion ha are temperate , boreal and sub-temperate forests in industrialized countries ; these are broadly stable or increasing , although there is still pressure on primary 6 / and natural stands , as well as damage from pollution and fires that reduce forest quality .  
A problem shared by developing and industrialized countries alike is that most current training programmes and institutional structures are sectoral and disciplinary and do not address the complex interactions among people , natural resources , technology , environment and development .  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The national committees for the Decade and related technical agencies of the industrialized countries have remained active in the respective countries and have pursued a variety of collaborative relationships with neighbouring countries , and supported disaster-reduction initiatives in developing countries .  
Furthermore , many industrialized countries of the North have experienced rising unemployment rates , inequitable resource distribution and unanticipated increases in poverty even as their economies were pronounced sound and their gross national product ( GNP ) continued to rise .  
The work deals with comparative experiences in the privatization of water supply , focusing on private sector participation in urban water utility operations in industrialized , developing and transitional countries , an important area of intergovernmental policy discussions , including those relevant to Habitat II .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
It is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
NULLIt is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
NULLStates reported adopting the recommendations on strengthening the efforts of the international community against money-laundering , adopted by the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) established by the Heads of State or Government of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and the President of the Commission of European Communities at the fifteenth annual economic summit , held in Paris in July 1989 .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
Not only were developing countries affected , given the unfavourable economic international climate , but also industrialized countries , where immigrant communities were increasingly the target of xenophobic , racist and intolerant acts .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
In conclusion , the Commission may wish to note that , historically , major socio-economic changes ( comparable to the scale of change required to restructure production and consumption in industrialized countries ) have occurred as a response to perceived opportunities ( for example , widespread availability of affordable cars ) not to government prescription .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
ITU had been instrumental in the establishment of the World Telecommunication Organization ( WorldTel ) , a cooperative body financed by private investors from industrialized countries which assisted developing countries in providing access to telecommunication facilities for a large segment of their population through the introduction of cost-effective technologies and the creation of a liberal economic environment .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
At the 1996 meeting of the group of seven major industrialized countries held in France in June , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States issued a final communiqu calling upon all States to spare no effort in securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
The Ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic approaches to programming , message content and networking in the media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
However , experiences from the industrialized countries have shown that investment alone does not pay off in terms of productivity gains if not accompanied by complementary policies creating an enabling environment , as well as an adequate level of cooperation between public and private R &amp; amp ; D .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
The enormous human and social strains of globalization could be minimized by stimulating sustained economic growth , particularly in the major industrialized countries .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
The understanding of the relationship between the environment and sustainable development , coupled with the call by the Rio Conference for an authentic , durable and widespread change of habits and attitudes , especially in industrialized countries , would create a pattern for development that was not only environmentally and socially sustainable , but also equitably distributed with the human person as its central focus .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
This is the most important resource possessed by our country , and the level of scientific development now attained is manifest in the existence of some 60 scientific research centres and an established body of scientists and research-workers that place Cuba on a level comparable with a number of averagely developed industrialized countries .  
In November 1996 , in the context of promoting bilateral and regional cooperation , the prime ministers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania signed at Riga a declaration on the fight against money-laundering , drawn up in cooperation with UNDCP , the European Commission and the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Therefore , with a view to contributing to international peace by tackling development issues in close cooperation with the United Nations , Japan has been taking the initiative for a new development strategy , which is to be based on the firm recognition of ownership of the countries involved , as well as a genuine partnership between them and industrialized countries .  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
Its aim is to extricate the country from its state of underdevelopment by the year 2020 and to establish a preliminary basis for its gradual transformation into an industrialized , modern country under the slogan Building a strong and prosperous country , ensuring the well-being of the people , forming a civilized and fair society .  
As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
I can not conclude this brief statement without drawing attention to the equally deplorable activities of some industrialized States , which dump toxic and hazardous wastes , especially in the waters of developing States , or carry out other forms of pollution through the deliberate discharge of pollutants such as oil and oily wastes , noxious liquids or solids , and sewage or garbage .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
Regarding the issue of development of Africa , he reminded the Committee that in 1993 Japan had played host to the economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Tokyo and had proposed a new development strategy in the context of the newly emerging realities of the post-cold-war era .  That initiative had formed the basis of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development which Japan had subsequently organized .  
A whole range of interrelated factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature contribute to the emergence and development of the movement of toxic wastes and dangerous products between the industrialized and the developing countries .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
At the same time , the Convention in other parts developed and codified many rules which were generally agreeable or even favourable to the industrialized States also ( e.g . related to the territorial waters or the exclusive economic zones ) .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
In fact , a monetary union without political union is virtually unprecedented for such a large , heterogeneous group of industrialized economies . 16 It is important to note that there are no legal provisions for an orderly exit of a country from EMU . 
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
It was convinced that the adoption of appropriate economic policies and the committed participation of the industrialized countries and international financial institutions would make it possible to meet the challenges of sustainable development .  
One of the key factors driving this dramatic growth in electronic commerce among the industrialized economies has been the achievement of a critical mass of online users .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
This is exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the informal sector of the economies of industrialized migrant-receiving countries and the growing demand for irregular migrant workers who , by definition , constitute an unprotected , docile and easily exploited workforce .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
It is now widely recognized that the implementation of sustainable development schemes will have to be based on original and innovative approaches to the development process , where sharing must be an integral part of the support given by the industrialized world .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
The primary goals of the Conference were to agree on an approach to development that would protect the environment while ensuring economic development , and to lay the foundation for a global partnership between the developing and the more industrialized countries , based on mutual needs and common interests , to ensure a healthy future for the planet .  
Some representatives pointed out that industry in industrialized countries continued to play an active role in developing both new and innovative space applications and technology geared for markets in services in satellite communications , remote sensing and space transportation .  
Nor can we overlook the fact that the current unjust and unsustainable international economic order continues to treat Africa as an economically undeveloped source of natural wealth , that serves the unsustainable consumption patterns of industrialized countries , among which are included the former colonizers .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;

Much has changed since the World Assembly on Ageing , which was held in Vienna in 1982 , when it was first acknowledged in an important international forum that the ageing of the population was not confined to the industrialized world but was actually going to have its greatest impact in our developing countries .  
It would be difficult to explain to the growing number of people who live in pockets of poverty throughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen , four years ago , we decided to help them and integrate them into the framework of the tremendous social development that prevails in their countries .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
It was designed to analyse the present debate on the multilateral liberalization of trade and regional economic integration promoted by the European Union and the actions the World Trade Organization and UNCTAD intended to undertake to create an international economic setting oriented towards the economic integration of less industrialized countries .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
The concept of special and differential treatment should be reviewed and strengthened to take account of the changing realities of world trade and of globalized production , and must be accompanied by capacity-building , enhanced market access and measures taken by industrialized countries to encourage their enterprises and institutions to transfer technology and know-how and invest in developing countries .  
This can be attained only through generous financial assistance from the industrialized world directed towards improving and enhancing weak infrastructures and augmenting national institutional capacities .  
It had also been recognized that the industrialized countries should take urgent measures , both corrective and preventive , to resolve pressing global environmental problems .  
The idea of 100 per cent reduction of ODA debt and eligible credits for countries qualifying for HIPC debt reduction , as presented in the Palermo statement of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries .  Possibility of naming a mediator acceptable to all relevant parties to facilitate arriving at a mutually satisfactory resolution of a debt crisis , as an additional voluntary option for debt restructuring .  
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,

What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
In terms of regular resources from private sector , UNICEF has consolidated a unique network of national committees in industrialized countries ( raising one third of UNICEFs resources ) and has developed alliances with important corporations , foundations and non-governmental organizations .  Those efforts resulted in a net income of US $ 165-million , which combined with the US $ 343-million from Governments and US $ 55 million from other income makes the total of US $ 563-million in core funding for 2001 .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
The fourth edition of the World Banks Poverty Trends and Voices of the Poor , 2001 reports on recent progress in poverty reduction for selected countries on the basis of data derived primarily from surveys using national poverty lines , not the $ 1 a day poverty line . 1 In East Asia , the sharp decline in poverty in China during the 1990s was accompanied by widening income inequality between the countrys more rural western provinces and the more industrialized east , which probably slowed the overall rate of poverty reduction for the country . 
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .  
It was learned that , the national project of new medicines and industrialized development , jointly promoted by departments of the State Science Commission , the Ministry of Public Health , the State Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau , etc . , is now being implemented .  By the end of this century , ten new patent protected medicines are planned to be developed and five new medicine selecting centers , five medication safety assessing centers and five medication clinic experimentation centers will be built .  
More gratifyingly and admiringly , since the proposal on innovations initiated by the Sixth CPV National Congress in 1986 , Vietnam has made new and tremendous achievements in socialist construction , its politics and society have remained stable , its economy has developed rapidly , the feature of the country has changed remarkably , the people 's lives have gradually improved , and its international position has enhanced , thus entering a new historic period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .  
Hu Jintao said : Since its founding , the Communist Party of Vietnam has always adhered to and upheld Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chih Ming Thought , maintained the leadership of the Communist Party , firmly kept to the path of socialism , triumphantly realized national liberation and reunification , scored remarkable achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform over the past 15 years , and led the Vietnamese people into a new historical period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
He pointed out that biotechnology is a critical area that will have bearing on national development in the 21st century , and it is also a new growth point for economic development , so we must concentrate our strengths and tackle key problems , accelerating the effort to come up with a group of scientific research achievements at advanced world levels and also speeding up the pace at which scientific research is transformed into results and becomes industrialized .  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .  
To follow the path of industrialized operation means to devote major efforts to advancing industrialized operation in cotton and encouraging cotton spinning enterprises to set up raw material production bases in cotton-producing areas and establish various forms of common interest communities with cotton farmers .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
The main grain producing areas must seize the opportunity of the expanded grain market space following the opening up of the sales areas , to meet market demands , optimize the grain variety composition , improve the quality , develop industrialized operations , and achieve the goal of increasing agricultural economic returns and peasant incomes .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
In the aspect of agriculture and rural areas , the regional party committee and government have actively readjusted the production structure of agriculture and on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study formulated the opinions of the autonomous region about readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure of agricultural products and pushing forward the industrialized operation of agriculture and proposed that farm production should focus on improving quality and uphold the unification of output , quality , structure , and effectiveness .  
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
Under the precondition of stabilizing farming output and never loosening grain production , we shall make full use of Shaanxi 's unique and abundant natural resources , mainly promote the industrialized production of fruits , especially apples , and promote the industrialization of animal farming , mainly , the indoor raising of sheep and cattle .  
As stressed at the session , strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing the farmers ' income must be considered as economic tasks of prime importance .  It is imperative to speed up agricultural and rural economic restructuring , energetically promote the industrialized operation of agriculture , vigorously conduct rural reforms in all fields , truly reduce the burdens on farmers , continue the help-the-poor work in rural areas , and take positive and steady steps to proceed with the urbanization program .  
As society has advanced , we have become more industrialized and urbanized . One consequence is that life has become more rushed , more hectic ; a slow , relaxing meal has become a luxury and " fast foods " have become all too common . In this " fast food society " , processed foods have gradually become a housewife 's best friend ; canned foods , frozen foods , and T . V . dinners are now found in almost every kitchen .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Tariffs have been cut on 3,500 categories of items , lowering the average effective tariff rate from 7.8 to approximately 5 percent , comparable to the rates in industrialized countries . Moreover , the New Taiwan dollar has been allowed to appreciate by more than 40 percent against the U . S . dollar since 1985 ; and private individuals can now buy as much as US $ 5 million for outward remittances .  
Under present circumstances , some areas can not be reported to you yet but there is one point that we should understand concerning the future development of the countries , centered around the newly industrialized countries . Viewed from the perspective of economic development , it is an undeniable fact that the center of the entire economy of the Pacific region has slowly shifted from the United States to the Western Pacific region , and the potential for the future development of economic power in this region is , in fact , fairly large .  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
Per Capita Income by the Year 2000By the year 2000 , the per capita gross national product in the Republic of China on Taiwan will exceed US $ 20,000 , a level comparable to per capita income in the highly industrialized countries of the West , and one which ranks her among the top twenty countries of the world . Estimates are that by that time the ROC 's foreign trade turnover will reach US $ 350 billion , which will make the ROC the tenth biggest trading country in the entire world .  
CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
In the past , refuse was invariably used for compost , burned or buried . Compost heaps have no place in an increasingly urban society , and open-air burning has been relinquished because of the air pollution it creates , but the growth of waste in a prosperous , industrialized nation is usually faster than that of the population .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
Santa Claus and the department stores team up to hoodwink innocent , trusting little children , and the original religious meaning of Christmas has been replaced by a superficial " eat , drink , and be merry " approach to the holidays . This has happened because industrialized society is pulling away from its agrarian roots .  
In recent years , every major meeting among industrialized nations having anything to do with economic globalization has been accompanied by rioting and protests . In particular , the huge riots in Seattle in 1999 have ignited a big upsurge in opposition to globalization . The G8 summit held this past July in Genoa , Italy was besieged by over 100,000 protesters .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
In terms of the international community , the level of financial support has consistently fallen short of requirements .  To a great extent this can be attributed to the economic difficulties experienced by industrialized countries in recent years .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
A specific aspect of this development especially worried the international community : the major troubled debtors were large , middleincome economies that owed the bulk of their debts to the top commercial banks of the key industrialized countries .  
Instead of coordinating their macroeconomic policies , however , the industrialized countries had sought to resolve their domestic problems in a purely national or restricted multilateral context .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
After the 1980s , which had been a lost decade for development , trends for the 1990s were not very encouraging : growing instability , uneven development , slow economic recovery and rising unemployment in the industrialized countries .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
We believe that the gap which exists , in the areas of economic growth and social advancement , between the wealthy industrialized countries , with their enormous economic resources , and the developing countries , is among the most chronic and significant problems that face the international community .  
However , our conscience can not rest easy in view of a reality that we can not ignore : the fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject poverty , and the challenges posed by the enormous gap between the annual per capita gross national product for the least developed countries less than $ 200 and that of advanced industrialized countries , which is more than a-hundred times higher . 
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
Approximately 1.4-billion ha are temperate , boreal and sub-temperate forests in industrialized countries ; these are broadly stable or increasing , although there is still pressure on primary 6 / and natural stands , as well as damage from pollution and fires that reduce forest quality .  
A problem shared by developing and industrialized countries alike is that most current training programmes and institutional structures are sectoral and disciplinary and do not address the complex interactions among people , natural resources , technology , environment and development .  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The national committees for the Decade and related technical agencies of the industrialized countries have remained active in the respective countries and have pursued a variety of collaborative relationships with neighbouring countries , and supported disaster-reduction initiatives in developing countries .  
Furthermore , many industrialized countries of the North have experienced rising unemployment rates , inequitable resource distribution and unanticipated increases in poverty even as their economies were pronounced sound and their gross national product ( GNP ) continued to rise .  
The work deals with comparative experiences in the privatization of water supply , focusing on private sector participation in urban water utility operations in industrialized , developing and transitional countries , an important area of intergovernmental policy discussions , including those relevant to Habitat II .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
It is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
NULLIt is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
NULLStates reported adopting the recommendations on strengthening the efforts of the international community against money-laundering , adopted by the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) established by the Heads of State or Government of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and the President of the Commission of European Communities at the fifteenth annual economic summit , held in Paris in July 1989 .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
Not only were developing countries affected , given the unfavourable economic international climate , but also industrialized countries , where immigrant communities were increasingly the target of xenophobic , racist and intolerant acts .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
In conclusion , the Commission may wish to note that , historically , major socio-economic changes ( comparable to the scale of change required to restructure production and consumption in industrialized countries ) have occurred as a response to perceived opportunities ( for example , widespread availability of affordable cars ) not to government prescription .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
ITU had been instrumental in the establishment of the World Telecommunication Organization ( WorldTel ) , a cooperative body financed by private investors from industrialized countries which assisted developing countries in providing access to telecommunication facilities for a large segment of their population through the introduction of cost-effective technologies and the creation of a liberal economic environment .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
At the 1996 meeting of the group of seven major industrialized countries held in France in June , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States issued a final communiqu calling upon all States to spare no effort in securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
The Ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic approaches to programming , message content and networking in the media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
However , experiences from the industrialized countries have shown that investment alone does not pay off in terms of productivity gains if not accompanied by complementary policies creating an enabling environment , as well as an adequate level of cooperation between public and private R &amp; amp ; D .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
The enormous human and social strains of globalization could be minimized by stimulating sustained economic growth , particularly in the major industrialized countries .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
The understanding of the relationship between the environment and sustainable development , coupled with the call by the Rio Conference for an authentic , durable and widespread change of habits and attitudes , especially in industrialized countries , would create a pattern for development that was not only environmentally and socially sustainable , but also equitably distributed with the human person as its central focus .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
This is the most important resource possessed by our country , and the level of scientific development now attained is manifest in the existence of some 60 scientific research centres and an established body of scientists and research-workers that place Cuba on a level comparable with a number of averagely developed industrialized countries .  
In November 1996 , in the context of promoting bilateral and regional cooperation , the prime ministers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania signed at Riga a declaration on the fight against money-laundering , drawn up in cooperation with UNDCP , the European Commission and the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Therefore , with a view to contributing to international peace by tackling development issues in close cooperation with the United Nations , Japan has been taking the initiative for a new development strategy , which is to be based on the firm recognition of ownership of the countries involved , as well as a genuine partnership between them and industrialized countries .  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
Its aim is to extricate the country from its state of underdevelopment by the year 2020 and to establish a preliminary basis for its gradual transformation into an industrialized , modern country under the slogan Building a strong and prosperous country , ensuring the well-being of the people , forming a civilized and fair society .  
As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
I can not conclude this brief statement without drawing attention to the equally deplorable activities of some industrialized States , which dump toxic and hazardous wastes , especially in the waters of developing States , or carry out other forms of pollution through the deliberate discharge of pollutants such as oil and oily wastes , noxious liquids or solids , and sewage or garbage .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
Regarding the issue of development of Africa , he reminded the Committee that in 1993 Japan had played host to the economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Tokyo and had proposed a new development strategy in the context of the newly emerging realities of the post-cold-war era .  That initiative had formed the basis of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development which Japan had subsequently organized .  
A whole range of interrelated factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature contribute to the emergence and development of the movement of toxic wastes and dangerous products between the industrialized and the developing countries .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
At the same time , the Convention in other parts developed and codified many rules which were generally agreeable or even favourable to the industrialized States also ( e.g . related to the territorial waters or the exclusive economic zones ) .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
In fact , a monetary union without political union is virtually unprecedented for such a large , heterogeneous group of industrialized economies . 16 It is important to note that there are no legal provisions for an orderly exit of a country from EMU . 
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
It was convinced that the adoption of appropriate economic policies and the committed participation of the industrialized countries and international financial institutions would make it possible to meet the challenges of sustainable development .  
One of the key factors driving this dramatic growth in electronic commerce among the industrialized economies has been the achievement of a critical mass of online users .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
This is exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the informal sector of the economies of industrialized migrant-receiving countries and the growing demand for irregular migrant workers who , by definition , constitute an unprotected , docile and easily exploited workforce .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
It is now widely recognized that the implementation of sustainable development schemes will have to be based on original and innovative approaches to the development process , where sharing must be an integral part of the support given by the industrialized world .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
The primary goals of the Conference were to agree on an approach to development that would protect the environment while ensuring economic development , and to lay the foundation for a global partnership between the developing and the more industrialized countries , based on mutual needs and common interests , to ensure a healthy future for the planet .  
Some representatives pointed out that industry in industrialized countries continued to play an active role in developing both new and innovative space applications and technology geared for markets in services in satellite communications , remote sensing and space transportation .  
Nor can we overlook the fact that the current unjust and unsustainable international economic order continues to treat Africa as an economically undeveloped source of natural wealth , that serves the unsustainable consumption patterns of industrialized countries , among which are included the former colonizers .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Much has changed since the World Assembly on Ageing , which was held in Vienna in 1982 , when it was first acknowledged in an important international forum that the ageing of the population was not confined to the industrialized world but was actually going to have its greatest impact in our developing countries .  
It would be difficult to explain to the growing number of people who live in pockets of poverty throughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen , four years ago , we decided to help them and integrate them into the framework of the tremendous social development that prevails in their countries .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
It was designed to analyse the present debate on the multilateral liberalization of trade and regional economic integration promoted by the European Union and the actions the World Trade Organization and UNCTAD intended to undertake to create an international economic setting oriented towards the economic integration of less industrialized countries .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
The concept of special and differential treatment should be reviewed and strengthened to take account of the changing realities of world trade and of globalized production , and must be accompanied by capacity-building , enhanced market access and measures taken by industrialized countries to encourage their enterprises and institutions to transfer technology and know-how and invest in developing countries .  
This can be attained only through generous financial assistance from the industrialized world directed towards improving and enhancing weak infrastructures and augmenting national institutional capacities .  
It had also been recognized that the industrialized countries should take urgent measures , both corrective and preventive , to resolve pressing global environmental problems .  
The idea of 100 per cent reduction of ODA debt and eligible credits for countries qualifying for HIPC debt reduction , as presented in the Palermo statement of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries .  Possibility of naming a mediator acceptable to all relevant parties to facilitate arriving at a mutually satisfactory resolution of a debt crisis , as an additional voluntary option for debt restructuring .  
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,

What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
In terms of regular resources from private sector , UNICEF has consolidated a unique network of national committees in industrialized countries ( raising one third of UNICEFs resources ) and has developed alliances with important corporations , foundations and non-governmental organizations .  Those efforts resulted in a net income of US $ 165-million , which combined with the US $ 343-million from Governments and US $ 55 million from other income makes the total of US $ 563-million in core funding for 2001 .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
The fourth edition of the World Banks Poverty Trends and Voices of the Poor , 2001 reports on recent progress in poverty reduction for selected countries on the basis of data derived primarily from surveys using national poverty lines , not the $ 1 a day poverty line . 1 In East Asia , the sharp decline in poverty in China during the 1990s was accompanied by widening income inequality between the countrys more rural western provinces and the more industrialized east , which probably slowed the overall rate of poverty reduction for the country . 
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .
