Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .

Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here .

He was the Assembly 's vice Speaker for six years and its Speaker for nine . He pursued the Confucian ideal of " personal cultivation , family regulation , orderly government and national peace . "  
These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history . The late years of the Chou marked the beginning of a long period of political instability throughout north and east China . This period which is recorded in the classic annals of " the Spring and Autumn " ( 722-484 BC ) saw China divided up into rival kingdoms , each with their own written language .  
The report stated that " pathological studies have recorded gallstones of numerous forms , such as ovate , spherical , spiked , and mulberry-shaped , while their sizes vary from that of a grain of sand to that of a chicken 's egg . Their colors cover a range from white , yellow , brown , and green to black . . . .  
Huang Wen-po has other ideas : " No matter whether the artistic status is crude or refined , these new style chen-t'ou are all products of a given era , have social significance , and deserve to be recorded . As for whether they can survive in the future , that 's for the market to decide . " He continues , " These type of chen-t'ou are refreshing , and at the very least are lots of fun , so there 's no point in attacking them . "  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
" Thus someone living in Harbin would be So-and-so Harbin , " he says by way of illustration . The Ching emperor Chien Lung ( 1736-1796 ) decided that the surname-less Jurchen consequently fell into rampant incestuous marriages . Only after a long period did fixed clan names evolve . The names of the eight Manchurian tribes were first recorded and explained in the Complete Record of the Family Names of the Eight Banners , so it was only from this time forward that the Jurchen had a relatively well-ordered system of family names .  
A 19th century English naturalist , exploring the clear waters and sharp cliffs , recorded the stunning impression these imposing precipices by the sea made on him : " The Portuguese must have first seen this island from the north or the south , for if they had seen it from the east , they would not have chosen a word as mundane as ' beautiful ' to describe it . "  
Since the endemic Mikado pheasant was first recorded 80 years ago , no other new bird species has been discovered in Taiwan , and in recent years although mammals such as bats or shrews have been newly recorded here , the island 's forests have been logged up to elevations of 2500 meters , and today if mammals have remained undiscovered it is because of their hidden or inaccessible habitat or their nocturnal habit .

Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
Seeing that many Han Chinese appear to be so concerned about surveying and recording aboriginal culture , Wu has , over the past two years , begun trying to collate and systematize aboriginal culinary culture .

Chess instruction texts or books of recorded games from ancient times have rather elegant sounding names . One can imagine chess lovers reclining with a pot of tea and enjoying a cool breeze as they go over classic contests of the past , watching as the red and the black sides battle it out to see who can make their position impregnable .  
The Han dynasty was steeped in mythology , with popular and imaginative themes such as the legendary tale of how Wen Wang , the Zhou king , met with the Goddess of the West . These were often recorded in picture form , and famous engravers carved images from such stories onto tile and stone , using a dynamic , flowing style that continues to serve as inspiration for painters and sculptors to this day .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
After analyzing large quantities of recorded maroon oriole song , Chang divided the calls of the male bird during the mating season into five categories , according to their sound spectrum .

As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .
