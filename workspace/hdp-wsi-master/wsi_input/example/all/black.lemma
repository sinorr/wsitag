To make up for the missing spices he adds rather more spring onions , ginger and garlic , to give the meat more of the light aroma of fresh vegetables .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
Using hot springs water to irrigate water convoluvus makes it grow to great size without being overripe . The sponge gourds are plump and firm , and they wo n't go dark when cooked . The whites of the water oats are really white , and the greens truly green with absolutely no black bit at the core .  
Lumps of hard black stuff with metal legs , containing many tiny crystals . For a number of years now , these unlikely looking little objects-integrated circuits ( ICs ) , the most typical of semiconductor products-have surpassed petroleum and gold to rank firmly in first place by total value among products imported into Taiwan .  
The black plum ( Prunus mume-also known by other names such as the Japanese flowering apricot ) is a small deciduous tree of the rose family ( Rosaceae ) . Its new shoots are bright green ; the trunk is straight and vertical ; the flower petioles are short .  
Song people really played out their penchant for probing things ' inner nature . Not bothered with ordinary flowers Thus categorized by the people of the Song , not only was the plum flower judged the most virtuous of the " noble four " of the black plum , the orchid , the bamboo and the chrysanthemum-the names of its cousins the peach , the Japanese plum , the cherry and the almond were all blackened .  
For instance , in summer the lesser coucal , which can often be seen in Taiwan , is brownish black all over its body , but its wings are chest-nut red , as if it were wearing a brightly colored shawl . Bird painter Ho Hua-jen describes it as having " chestnut wings with a metallic sheen . " This cuckoo , at least , is not so bad looking after all .  
Liao Yu-hui suggested that the feelings of being married are something that single people can not really understand . She really loves that feeling of having to think of the other person before doing anything . You Hsia , on the other hand , averred that intimate relations between married couples today ought to be similar to a black-and-white yin-yang circle ; they make up a single , coherent picture , but with the black and white very clearly distinguished , each keeping their own character , and not mixing together into one gray field .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
In its appraisal of the color of cats ' fur , China 's classic reference on cats , Xiang Mao Jing , offers no such indication . On the contrary , cats whose backs are black ( or brown ) and whose abdomens , legs , feet and claws are all white it considers the quintessential form of multicolored cat , giving them the sobriquet " ebony clouds covering the snow . "  
Shunza 's music is classic US black music , ranging from rock and jazz to R &amp; B . A style that Taiwan 's female singers have rarely tried in the past has taken the market by storm , and her musical style and moving voice have been the subject of intense discussion on the Internet .  
In 1959 the Chinese communists invaded Tibet , and the Dalai Lama and leading officials fled abroad . They took much valuable jewelry with them , including coral , amber and turquoise , as well as many mysterious dZi beads with their stunning contrasts of white on black .  
Its factory districts are neat and clean ; the factories themselves are sealed and lack both smokestacks belching black smoke and the never-ending streams of trucks typical of traditional industry . " [ The public ] knows nothing about the firms and has no dealings with them , " says Chung Shu-chi , a Hsinchu native who is both a delegate to the National Assembly and one of the founders of the Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Association .  
Each time , this man who had said he just wanted to go peacefully was yanked back from the brink of death by his doctors . He received more than a thousand heart stimulant injections , for which a long and sharp needle must pierce the heart itself . The extreme pressure from the CPR which he received on numerous occasions had left several of his ribs broken . And his skin had turned black , burned by the repeated electrical charges . . . .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
" It did n't matter whether they knew you or not , every day people were coming around the patients ' beds talking about this or that famous doctor , secret cure , medicine , or cancer-related group . There were even people providing channels for directly purchasing medications and inoculations from abroad . " One thing she found especially remarkable was the frequent sight of can after can of some nameless inky black liquid on the bedside tables of patients .  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
Hung out in front of many of the farmhouses were brightly colored carp streamers , with the carp 's golden scales glittering against backgrounds of black , red , blue , purple , green , orange . . . . The gay streamers fluttering in the breeze against a wide open sky only intensified the feeling of spring in the air .  
This 2,000-year-old sleeping beauty has " preserved her good looks " by being sealed in a plaster cast over 100 centimeters thick and using over 5,000 kilos of charcoal to dehumidify her tomb . When she was unearthed , archeologists found her wrapped in 18 layers of silk . Her hair was still black , some of her skin still retained a hint of suppleness , and her joints could still bend . Unlike the mummies of Egypt , the marquise seemed almost like a living person after centuries in the tomb .  
Chess instruction texts or books of recorded games from ancient times have rather elegant sounding names . One can imagine chess lovers reclining with a pot of tea and enjoying a cool breeze as they go over classic contests of the past , watching as the red and the black sides battle it out to see who can make their position impregnable .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
All of a sudden the troupe was playing to packed houses and endless curtain calls . In 1983 the Siong Leng Musical Association traveled to Wales for the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod , where Ding 's wife Ong Guat-huah appeared on stage in a black full-length Chinese qipao gown to sing one of Ding 's new songs . She won third place in the folk solo category , and her accompanists took fourth place .  
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " ( the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , and raising economic competitiveness .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
As Liu Shao-tang explained in Volume 64 , No . 2 : " From the struggle between Sun and Huang in the early years of the Republic , through the chaos of the warlord era and the North-South standoff , to the periods of cooperation and conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists , Yu witnessed countless political struggles . He saw how much historical data was distorted or destroyed , how right was turned into wrong and black into white , and how whoever won the battles also won history .  
Paintings on silk tend to degenerate fairly quickly , generally lasting a century or two , with the oldest surviving examples ( safely buried underground ) dating back no further than two thousand years to the Han dynasty . But ceramic works can keep their color for millennia , and today we can still appreciate works of colored pottery and black pottery from as far back as six and seven thousand years ago . " Painting enhances the value of ceramics , and ceramics enables painting to last through time . "  
The first artist to use the services of the Ciyang Kiln , Chen Ching-jung , paints in a dark , brooding style reminiscent of charcoal sketches . It took Lin a year of experimentation before he found that the most effective way of expressing Chen 's art through the ceramic medium was by using an underglaze of carbon black plus a dark blue pigment .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
In design terms , to attract young people Peter Sung is tending even more to abandon ornate palace-style accessories in favor of bright , fresh white walls and red gingham tablecloths , along with movable screens carved with Chinese characters , and chairs made from black steel tubing in a Ming-dynasty style , to create a Chinese style with a young and modern feel .  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
At about noon , the tree is occupied by a pair of black bulbuls . Normally timid when confronted by a predator , the two murmuring bulbuls do n't fly off in a flustered rush when a giant crested goshawk flies near . Instead , they take to the air and chase the goshawk away .  
Ju Ming has hired the artist Chuang Ming-chi to fly up every week from his home in southern Taiwan to spend the weekends in residence at the museum painting the outside wall of the Main Building . In bold black lines , Chuang has been covering the wall with assorted images of people and animals in stylized representations reminiscent of aboriginal art .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
There is nothing in the main living area save a large desk covered with black plastic matting , a TV set , and mountainous piles of long sheets of calligraphy paper . But there are other signs as well . On the wall hangs a scroll , reading " Dragon flying , phoenix dancing , " done in a flowing , dynamic hand .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
" They live mixed in with greater crested terns , and this makes them really difficult to pick out . But in our film they do show up very clearly , " says Liang Chieh-te , who was commissioned to film greater crested terns by the Lienchiang County Government . The greater crested tern is around 45 centimeters long . Its most distinctive features are that it has a forked tail like a swallow , a crest of black feathers on its head rather like a Mohican haircut , and a yellow beak .  
In the mahogany plantation alongside Kuanshan 's cemetery , we have the delightful experience of winding our way through a garden carpeted with fallen yellow leaves . As the trail passes among the mahogany trees , we hear the rustle of dry leaves under our wheels and the song of black bulbul and Chinese bulbul in the trees .  
There is a Taiwanese saying that " the oriole is an emperor , the drongo is a disappointed scholar , and the kite is a beggar . " This is simply because the black-naped oriole 's golden-yellow plumage is like the robes of an ancient emperor , and the black drongo 's inky plumage gives it the air of a down-at-heel scholar , while the black kite 's rough and mottled feathers , and its habit of snatching chicks to fill its belly , suggest a starving mendicant .  
Many of the rocks from mudslides in Chungliao have also been left to lie . People there are used to disaster , and to mud . Smoothing scars When pictures are beamed into every living room showing vivid scenes of jetliners striking skyscrapers , with black smoke billowing and people running for their lives , or of deadly mudslides and floods , it is hard not to be disturbed by them .  
The collared bush robin is a pretty little bird . The male has a coat of black feathers , a white line across each brow , and a bright band of orange around its neck that makes it look like a dandy wearing a flashy cravat .  
Ever curious about foreigners , the rural children were always bashful . In their eyes , in which black and white were so finely contrasted , and in their candid smiles , you could see the hope and future of their country . However , when they opened their mouths , it always made me feel uneasy , for they would always say , " Amiga !  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
And so he often placed his classmates against barren backgrounds for photographs . He sometimes painted half of a model 's face white or had him lie on a rock with a plastic bag over his head and a black cape over his shoulders . Chang tried to make his subjects look alienated and isolated , as if life had given up on them .  
Chen 's sense of fashion made a deep impression on me the first time we met . Still short of his 40th birthday , he was dressed in a smartly tailored black suit . The collar was turned up , and he looked a bit like the dashing lead in some detective movie . His hair was combed forward and upward , as is very much in style these days .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
The first specialist pharmacological work to record lingzhi was the ancient Chinese pharmacopoeia Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing ( " Shen Nong 's Herbal " ) , believed to date from the 1st century BCE . It distinguishes six kinds of lingzhi : red , orange , blue , purple , white and black . Today , over 100 species of lingzhi are known , and they are the subject of intensive pharmaceutical research in many countries .  
The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million . The Kaohsiung City Election Commission , following established precedent , was only able to levy a paltry fine of NT $ 100,000 . In addition to amending the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , there is a pressing need to enact legislation that will stamp out black gold corruption and provide for greater transparency .  
During the daytime the sunlight in a cockpit can be blinding , so it must be possible for the monitor to be adjusted to extreme brightness , otherwise the screen will just be a sheet of white . Indeed , whether it is the black of night or the middle of a lightning storm , all kinds of weather conditions and topography are variables in the use of instruments in flight , and must be carefully considered .  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
That afternoon , the sky suddenly turns black and a strong wind comes up , and raindrops the size of coins-seemingly racing to the ground-come crashing down on the corrugated steel roofs of buildings , raising a racket that shakes the very air . It is like an invading army , and I watch as the water fills the embassy compound , then begins to seep into my office , and soon is washing over my feet . ( I must have made a comical sight . )  
When the salt fields were initially developed , the lagoons and sand bars at Szutsao Lake in Anping were mainly employed . Using basalt and coral rock from Penghu for dikes , the seawater was first channeled into large evaporating ponds . After initial evaporation , the briny water was channeled into small evaporating ponds where it was further concentrated , and the resulting black brine was channeled into crystallization ponds where exposure to the sun yielded crystallized salt .  
You can see incorrect usage wherever you look . I 'll give you some examples . After mainland tour groups started coming to Taiwan , I was hired to train local tour guides . I advised them to be sure that visitors from Shandong Province would n't be offended by the ubiquitous shop signs advertising lu rou fan ( rice topped with chunks of pork stewed in black bean sauce ) .  
Before 1996 , bright red was practically synonymous with Huang 's painting and three-dimensional work , but since then he has employed other colors . Huang offers an intriguing explanation of the meaning behind this transformation : " Painting is the expression of subconscious desires . An artist may employ lively red yet feel loneliness within . Or he may paint freely with mysterious black or melancholy blue yet harbor a growing zest for life in his heart . "  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
The asphalt itself creates many lines on its own , and these give the paintings a simple and unpretentious quality . No wonder Chiu has become so thoroughly enamored of asphalt . Interestingly , while we are used to seeing asphalt that is black due to its thickness , it turns into various shades of brown when diluted with solvent . Sometimes , Chiu adds pigment to give the asphalt " color . "  
The town charter , carved on a black tablet in front of the town hall , is less a set of regulations than a gentle reminder of the townsfolk 's common ideals , and the Shikatsu Historical and Folklore Museum , situated behind the town hall , could be considered a physical manifestation of these very ideals .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
Another design technique he tried is known as " watermarking . " This technique consists of scraping portions of the skin off a gourd when it 's nearly ripe , and then sticking pieces of black paper into the stripped areas , leaving the gourd to dry in the sun . Once the gourd has gone a pale yellow in the sun , the paper is torn away , revealing a pattern of contrasting dark and light areas .  
With a fine ink , a literatus could produce numerous hues , draw forth the endless mysteries that lie between black and white , and create unique and exquisite images . Indeed , with such ink to hand , a literatus could hardly bear to set his brush aside .  
They even make a crunching noise when you grind them . The artificial soot and preservatives in liquid ink , on the other hand , not only give you a lifeless black , but also damage your brush . And works created with them just do n't last-the color always begins to deteriorate after just a couple of years . " Chen laments that this unprecedented effort to teach calligraphy was so superficial , and failed to take the cultivation of the individual as its foundation .  
In one of the main lanes of the village of Wutai in the mountains of Pingtung County , there is beautiful stone-slab pattern in black , the Rukai tribe 's favorite color , on a side wall . Below the wall a small electric box has been painstakingly covered with a wooden ornament .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face . Then they dab their fingers with red or black pigment and outline the shape of the character 's eyes . Next , they begin to paint the base . For instance , the civil and martial mandarins and Generals Liu and Xie have white pigment applied first , whereas the two sides of General Gan 's face are painted separately red and black , and General Fan 's face is painted inky black .

Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed the overwhelming majority black population with a heavy legacy of poverty , social disintegration and political cleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
The explanatory memorandum annexed to document A / 50 / 145 presumptuously claims that the examination by the United Nations of Taiwan 's " exceptional situation in the international context " " completely conforms with the principles and spirit of preventive diplomacy " .  This is an apparent attempt to confound black and white and mislead the public .  
The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .  
The development of this new article , which introduces both the precautionary approach and the polluter pays principle , is connected with proposals to include " reverse lists " - i.e . , instead of " black and grey lists " , which means that all dumping would be strictly prohibited with the exception of clearly identified waste categories - and the Waste Assessment Framework .  
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .

Targeted sanctions are a less blunt instrument than comprehensive sanctions , thereby minimizing humanitarian costs , the disruption of non-military trade , the likelihood of a black market emerging , additional humanitarian aid requirements and a negative impact on social infrastructures .  
Throughout his adult life Roosevelt Douglas had a singular passionate commitment to the struggle for the liberation of black people everywhere and for the economic and political empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged .  
For detailed mapping of particular seafloor sites and precise small-scale sampling , including sampling of hydrothermal fluids at active black smoker chimneys , manned research submersibles or remotely operated vehicles are required , equipped with photographic and video systems , TV-guided grabs for controlled geological sampling and portable drilling and coring devices .  
On the firing practice field , a group of soldiers in camouflage uniform quietly lied prostrate in the cold wind .  The three greenish black " Hongjian " antitank missiles settled on the missile-support strut stood straight up , alert and ready , and the warheads glared like a tiger at the white target several thousand meters away .  
The exposure and punishment according to law of black sheep and corrosive elements among customs personnel is in itself a major achievement in the anti-smuggling work and in the fight against corruption and in the campaign promoting clean and honest administration , which shows that our party and government not only persist in the reform and opening up policy but also harshly crack down on economic crimes , and demonstrates that our party and government have the determination and capabilities to punish corrupt elements and to eradicate cancerous tumors .  
With a high forest acreage and abundant hydroelectric resources , it has favorable natural conditions and resources for economic development .  Its annual average agricultural output is three times the residents ' total demand .  It is June now , and waves of golden wheat can be seen everywhere in fields of rich black soil .  
they hold that there is nothing wrong so long as the contents of pirated material are neither " yellow " ( pornographic ) nor " black " ( politically questionable } .  If we allow pirating to flourish unchecked , writers will be unwilling to " work " for the pirates , and publishing houses will flinch from an input of several hundred-thousand or several million yuan .  The Commercial Press has developed a CD-ROM of the " Ci Yuan " , but they still do not dare to take it out for fear of piracy .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China . This act has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is intolerable to every religious believer who loves his country .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
The western anti-China forces have discovered the points in common they have with Li Hongzhi and taken a favorable view of the use value of " Falungong , " and have thus not hesitated to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong in gesticulating and making groundless accusations at the Chinese Government for banning the " Falungong " cult according to law .  
The Chinese Government and people express strong indignation and discontent at the move of the Japanese Government , heedless of China 's many stern representations and ignoring the just cries of the peoples of Asia , in being bent on allowing the emergence of this textbook which confuses right and wrong and reverses black and white .  
All these arguments , which confuse right and wrong and confound black and white , are attempts to cover up Japan 's criminal history of aggression with a " beautiful veil " and deceive the future generations so as to attain the aim of completely changing the traditional evaluation of the war of aggression .

Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
In its appraisal of the color of cats ' fur , China 's classic reference on cats , Xiang Mao Jing , offers no such indication . On the contrary , cats whose backs are black ( or brown ) and whose abdomens , legs , feet and claws are all white it considers the quintessential form of multicolored cat , giving them the sobriquet " ebony clouds covering the snow . "  
Shunza 's music is classic US black music , ranging from rock and jazz to R &amp; B . A style that Taiwan 's female singers have rarely tried in the past has taken the market by storm , and her musical style and moving voice have been the subject of intense discussion on the Internet .  
In 1959 the Chinese communists invaded Tibet , and the Dalai Lama and leading officials fled abroad . They took much valuable jewelry with them , including coral , amber and turquoise , as well as many mysterious dZi beads with their stunning contrasts of white on black .  
Its factory districts are neat and clean ; the factories themselves are sealed and lack both smokestacks belching black smoke and the never-ending streams of trucks typical of traditional industry . " [ The public ] knows nothing about the firms and has no dealings with them , " says Chung Shu-chi , a Hsinchu native who is both a delegate to the National Assembly and one of the founders of the Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Association .  
Each time , this man who had said he just wanted to go peacefully was yanked back from the brink of death by his doctors . He received more than a thousand heart stimulant injections , for which a long and sharp needle must pierce the heart itself . The extreme pressure from the CPR which he received on numerous occasions had left several of his ribs broken . And his skin had turned black , burned by the repeated electrical charges . . . .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
" It did n't matter whether they knew you or not , every day people were coming around the patients ' beds talking about this or that famous doctor , secret cure , medicine , or cancer-related group . There were even people providing channels for directly purchasing medications and inoculations from abroad . " One thing she found especially remarkable was the frequent sight of can after can of some nameless inky black liquid on the bedside tables of patients .  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
Hung out in front of many of the farmhouses were brightly colored carp streamers , with the carp 's golden scales glittering against backgrounds of black , red , blue , purple , green , orange . . . . The gay streamers fluttering in the breeze against a wide open sky only intensified the feeling of spring in the air .  
This 2,000-year-old sleeping beauty has " preserved her good looks " by being sealed in a plaster cast over 100 centimeters thick and using over 5,000 kilos of charcoal to dehumidify her tomb . When she was unearthed , archeologists found her wrapped in 18 layers of silk . Her hair was still black , some of her skin still retained a hint of suppleness , and her joints could still bend . Unlike the mummies of Egypt , the marquise seemed almost like a living person after centuries in the tomb .  
Chess instruction texts or books of recorded games from ancient times have rather elegant sounding names . One can imagine chess lovers reclining with a pot of tea and enjoying a cool breeze as they go over classic contests of the past , watching as the red and the black sides battle it out to see who can make their position impregnable .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
All of a sudden the troupe was playing to packed houses and endless curtain calls . In 1983 the Siong Leng Musical Association traveled to Wales for the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod , where Ding 's wife Ong Guat-huah appeared on stage in a black full-length Chinese qipao gown to sing one of Ding 's new songs . She won third place in the folk solo category , and her accompanists took fourth place .  
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " ( the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , and raising economic competitiveness .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
As Liu Shao-tang explained in Volume 64 , No . 2 : " From the struggle between Sun and Huang in the early years of the Republic , through the chaos of the warlord era and the North-South standoff , to the periods of cooperation and conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists , Yu witnessed countless political struggles . He saw how much historical data was distorted or destroyed , how right was turned into wrong and black into white , and how whoever won the battles also won history .  
Paintings on silk tend to degenerate fairly quickly , generally lasting a century or two , with the oldest surviving examples ( safely buried underground ) dating back no further than two thousand years to the Han dynasty . But ceramic works can keep their color for millennia , and today we can still appreciate works of colored pottery and black pottery from as far back as six and seven thousand years ago . " Painting enhances the value of ceramics , and ceramics enables painting to last through time . "  
The first artist to use the services of the Ciyang Kiln , Chen Ching-jung , paints in a dark , brooding style reminiscent of charcoal sketches . It took Lin a year of experimentation before he found that the most effective way of expressing Chen 's art through the ceramic medium was by using an underglaze of carbon black plus a dark blue pigment .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
In design terms , to attract young people Peter Sung is tending even more to abandon ornate palace-style accessories in favor of bright , fresh white walls and red gingham tablecloths , along with movable screens carved with Chinese characters , and chairs made from black steel tubing in a Ming-dynasty style , to create a Chinese style with a young and modern feel .  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
At about noon , the tree is occupied by a pair of black bulbuls . Normally timid when confronted by a predator , the two murmuring bulbuls do n't fly off in a flustered rush when a giant crested goshawk flies near . Instead , they take to the air and chase the goshawk away .  
Ju Ming has hired the artist Chuang Ming-chi to fly up every week from his home in southern Taiwan to spend the weekends in residence at the museum painting the outside wall of the Main Building . In bold black lines , Chuang has been covering the wall with assorted images of people and animals in stylized representations reminiscent of aboriginal art .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
There is nothing in the main living area save a large desk covered with black plastic matting , a TV set , and mountainous piles of long sheets of calligraphy paper . But there are other signs as well . On the wall hangs a scroll , reading " Dragon flying , phoenix dancing , " done in a flowing , dynamic hand .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
" They live mixed in with greater crested terns , and this makes them really difficult to pick out . But in our film they do show up very clearly , " says Liang Chieh-te , who was commissioned to film greater crested terns by the Lienchiang County Government . The greater crested tern is around 45 centimeters long . Its most distinctive features are that it has a forked tail like a swallow , a crest of black feathers on its head rather like a Mohican haircut , and a yellow beak .  
In the mahogany plantation alongside Kuanshan 's cemetery , we have the delightful experience of winding our way through a garden carpeted with fallen yellow leaves . As the trail passes among the mahogany trees , we hear the rustle of dry leaves under our wheels and the song of black bulbul and Chinese bulbul in the trees .  
There is a Taiwanese saying that " the oriole is an emperor , the drongo is a disappointed scholar , and the kite is a beggar . " This is simply because the black-naped oriole 's golden-yellow plumage is like the robes of an ancient emperor , and the black drongo 's inky plumage gives it the air of a down-at-heel scholar , while the black kite 's rough and mottled feathers , and its habit of snatching chicks to fill its belly , suggest a starving mendicant .  
Many of the rocks from mudslides in Chungliao have also been left to lie . People there are used to disaster , and to mud . Smoothing scars When pictures are beamed into every living room showing vivid scenes of jetliners striking skyscrapers , with black smoke billowing and people running for their lives , or of deadly mudslides and floods , it is hard not to be disturbed by them .  
The collared bush robin is a pretty little bird . The male has a coat of black feathers , a white line across each brow , and a bright band of orange around its neck that makes it look like a dandy wearing a flashy cravat .  
Ever curious about foreigners , the rural children were always bashful . In their eyes , in which black and white were so finely contrasted , and in their candid smiles , you could see the hope and future of their country . However , when they opened their mouths , it always made me feel uneasy , for they would always say , " Amiga !  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
And so he often placed his classmates against barren backgrounds for photographs . He sometimes painted half of a model 's face white or had him lie on a rock with a plastic bag over his head and a black cape over his shoulders . Chang tried to make his subjects look alienated and isolated , as if life had given up on them .  
Chen 's sense of fashion made a deep impression on me the first time we met . Still short of his 40th birthday , he was dressed in a smartly tailored black suit . The collar was turned up , and he looked a bit like the dashing lead in some detective movie . His hair was combed forward and upward , as is very much in style these days .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
The first specialist pharmacological work to record lingzhi was the ancient Chinese pharmacopoeia Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing ( " Shen Nong 's Herbal " ) , believed to date from the 1st century BCE . It distinguishes six kinds of lingzhi : red , orange , blue , purple , white and black . Today , over 100 species of lingzhi are known , and they are the subject of intensive pharmaceutical research in many countries .  
The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million . The Kaohsiung City Election Commission , following established precedent , was only able to levy a paltry fine of NT $ 100,000 . In addition to amending the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , there is a pressing need to enact legislation that will stamp out black gold corruption and provide for greater transparency .  
During the daytime the sunlight in a cockpit can be blinding , so it must be possible for the monitor to be adjusted to extreme brightness , otherwise the screen will just be a sheet of white . Indeed , whether it is the black of night or the middle of a lightning storm , all kinds of weather conditions and topography are variables in the use of instruments in flight , and must be carefully considered .  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
That afternoon , the sky suddenly turns black and a strong wind comes up , and raindrops the size of coins-seemingly racing to the ground-come crashing down on the corrugated steel roofs of buildings , raising a racket that shakes the very air . It is like an invading army , and I watch as the water fills the embassy compound , then begins to seep into my office , and soon is washing over my feet . ( I must have made a comical sight . )  
When the salt fields were initially developed , the lagoons and sand bars at Szutsao Lake in Anping were mainly employed . Using basalt and coral rock from Penghu for dikes , the seawater was first channeled into large evaporating ponds . After initial evaporation , the briny water was channeled into small evaporating ponds where it was further concentrated , and the resulting black brine was channeled into crystallization ponds where exposure to the sun yielded crystallized salt .  
You can see incorrect usage wherever you look . I 'll give you some examples . After mainland tour groups started coming to Taiwan , I was hired to train local tour guides . I advised them to be sure that visitors from Shandong Province would n't be offended by the ubiquitous shop signs advertising lu rou fan ( rice topped with chunks of pork stewed in black bean sauce ) .  
Before 1996 , bright red was practically synonymous with Huang 's painting and three-dimensional work , but since then he has employed other colors . Huang offers an intriguing explanation of the meaning behind this transformation : " Painting is the expression of subconscious desires . An artist may employ lively red yet feel loneliness within . Or he may paint freely with mysterious black or melancholy blue yet harbor a growing zest for life in his heart . "  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
The asphalt itself creates many lines on its own , and these give the paintings a simple and unpretentious quality . No wonder Chiu has become so thoroughly enamored of asphalt . Interestingly , while we are used to seeing asphalt that is black due to its thickness , it turns into various shades of brown when diluted with solvent . Sometimes , Chiu adds pigment to give the asphalt " color . "  
The town charter , carved on a black tablet in front of the town hall , is less a set of regulations than a gentle reminder of the townsfolk 's common ideals , and the Shikatsu Historical and Folklore Museum , situated behind the town hall , could be considered a physical manifestation of these very ideals .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
Another design technique he tried is known as " watermarking . " This technique consists of scraping portions of the skin off a gourd when it 's nearly ripe , and then sticking pieces of black paper into the stripped areas , leaving the gourd to dry in the sun . Once the gourd has gone a pale yellow in the sun , the paper is torn away , revealing a pattern of contrasting dark and light areas .  
With a fine ink , a literatus could produce numerous hues , draw forth the endless mysteries that lie between black and white , and create unique and exquisite images . Indeed , with such ink to hand , a literatus could hardly bear to set his brush aside .  
They even make a crunching noise when you grind them . The artificial soot and preservatives in liquid ink , on the other hand , not only give you a lifeless black , but also damage your brush . And works created with them just do n't last-the color always begins to deteriorate after just a couple of years . " Chen laments that this unprecedented effort to teach calligraphy was so superficial , and failed to take the cultivation of the individual as its foundation .  
In one of the main lanes of the village of Wutai in the mountains of Pingtung County , there is beautiful stone-slab pattern in black , the Rukai tribe 's favorite color , on a side wall . Below the wall a small electric box has been painstakingly covered with a wooden ornament .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face . Then they dab their fingers with red or black pigment and outline the shape of the character 's eyes . Next , they begin to paint the base . For instance , the civil and martial mandarins and Generals Liu and Xie have white pigment applied first , whereas the two sides of General Gan 's face are painted separately red and black , and General Fan 's face is painted inky black .

It is reported that once J . E . removed his shoe in front of the judge in order to show the black points left by the instruments utilized when administering electric shocks . 
Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed the overwhelming majority black population with a heavy legacy of poverty , social disintegration and political cleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
The explanatory memorandum annexed to document A / 50 / 145 presumptuously claims that the examination by the United Nations of Taiwan 's " exceptional situation in the international context " " completely conforms with the principles and spirit of preventive diplomacy " .  This is an apparent attempt to confound black and white and mislead the public .  
The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .  
The development of this new article , which introduces both the precautionary approach and the polluter pays principle , is connected with proposals to include " reverse lists " - i.e . , instead of " black and grey lists " , which means that all dumping would be strictly prohibited with the exception of clearly identified waste categories - and the Waste Assessment Framework .  
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .
