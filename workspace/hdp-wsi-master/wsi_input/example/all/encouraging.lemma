On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .

As for sports , both sides would step up collaboration on the development of sports industries .  
Love for learning is a proud tradition as well as a powerful motive force responsible for the rapid growth of our publishing industry .

From initial eagerness to break the barriers of the past , to a falling away from the associations as success came to the individuals who composed them , to the nostalgic exhibition held this year in Taipei , the early forerunners of modern art in Taiwan showed that despite changing circumstances , they still hold a deep interest in remembering the past and encouraging young artists towards the future .

Huang says that Stan Lai is super efficient at moving the work along . He constantly revises the plot that developed out of rehearsal from the day before and constantly inspires the actors with fresh interest . He 's adept at encouraging them and giving them hope when they 're stuck .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
Most people will say that spoken or sung folk literature serves the purpose of instructing , encouraging and consoling the illiterate masses . There 's nothing wrong with this , but one ought to take it a step farther . Written literature does in fact develop from folk literature . Its writers are in fact the masses , andt is thus easier for them to create lively new forms , which in turn stimulate written literature to renew and transform itself .  
Electric cars , moreover , have batteries that contain lead acid , which can not be broken down for many hundreds of years . Before a recycling system is established , they will also be a source of pollution . But the electric car is squeaky clean in comparison to the omnipresent pollution wreaked by its gasoline-burning predecessor , and the Environmental Protection Administration is forcefully encouraging its development .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
The government has set up a treatment plant for highly concentrated electroplating fluid in the Taichung area , and it is encouraging operators to use collective methods to turn their waste water over to specialists for disposal .

Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Q : After you came back , you devoted yourself to encouraging talented people from Taiwan who now live overseas to return home , and you established the Foundation for Development of Outstanding Fellows . A while back we went to the mainland to conduct interviews and discovered that you are the chairman of the Tan Kah Kee International Institute , which was established in honor of the famous Southeast Asian Chinese who founded Xiamen University .  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education .

"  
In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation .

With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society .

As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .

Taiwan at that time was in the midst of an " economic miracle " fueled by the export success of its small and medium enterprises .

Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
Besides encouraging perverse ideas about violence and sex , TV promotes superficiality , crudity and superstition . Things shown in the media often deviate sharply from what children are taught in school or need to know in real life . " It 's really worrying that a lot of nonsense which is meant merely to be for the entertainment of adults becomes accepted as authoritative by minors , " says Joyce Yen Feng .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
Taipei City was the earliest jurisdiction to implement multiple channels of entry for high schools . Many high schools adopted new criteria for admission , including recommendation , weighting of particular classes , a second round of testing ( oral or written ) , or calculation of the overall junior high school grade point average . However , various observers accused Taipei of " raising entry standards arbitrarily and encouraging elitism . " Thus , this year these methods will all be discontinued .  
However , Professor Kim was well aware of Hsiao 's romantic temperament and tender nature ; his works have always abounded with vivid color and layer upon layer of beautiful , unforgettable melody . As a result , Kim reminded Hsiao that he need n't be a slave to modern music and its jarring dissonances , encouraging him instead to follow his own musical path .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
Wufeng is the leading producer of these in Taiwan , with more than 40 growers cultivating a large range of varieties including the enoki ( or enokitake ) , of which Wufeng is one of the world 's leading sources . The ROC government has been encouraging the growing of edible mushrooms since as far back as the immediate post-WWII period . Wufeng has played a leading role in the development of mushrooms as an economic crop in Taiwan , and has earned a considerable amount of foreign exchange in the process .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .
