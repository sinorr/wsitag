In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
Some of them are overanxious for quick results and doing things on too large a scale , and they set a very high standard , making their training program look dynamic ; but in fact it is inappropriate , unable to achieve desired results .

This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
All this does not tally with the guideline set by the 15th National CPC Congress . To give private enterprises equal treatment is not an expedient measure under the condition of underdeveloped productive forces .

However , China 's current legal system is yet to be refined .  According to the guideline set by the 15th CPC National Congress , by 2010 , China should establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .

The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi .

Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?  Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?

At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .

The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .

Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
The western region 's economy is relatively backward , and even for the provincial cities , their economies and tertiary industry are still underdeveloped .

Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .

The new Taiwan leader inherited Li Denghui 's " Taiwan independence " line , negated the " 1992 consensus , " insisted on continuing the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy , set up barriers to the opening of direct " three exchanges " across the strait , openly asserted that " unification is not the only option , " and perused money diplomacy to expand their " international space .

The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .  
It is necessary to strengthen education in the party 's basic line and education on General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " so that the vast number of grass-roots judicial administrators and police officers will more firmly adopt a correct outlook on the world and on life and adopt a set of correct values , and will work faithfully in law enforcement , provide enthusiastic services for the people , and keep their own conduct upright and incorruptible .  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .

All these " precedents " set by the certain air force aviation regiment - - each of which is worthy of being recorded in the development history of the people 's air force - - show to the people : In future wars , the regiment will definitely be a " formidable sword in the vast sky " capable of both attacking and defending and of smashing any fortifications .  
Third , we should tighten the efforts in compiling the needed teaching materials , and work as quickly as possible to come up with well-compiled teaching materials suitable for different types of cadres to study .  We should make earnest efforts to address the existing problems found in our teaching materials - - such problems as they are not systematic or relevant , and they have only " one size that fits all . "  We should tighten centralized planning and set up a scientific and rational system of compiling teaching materials for the training of cadres .  
Political party politics is especially far from maturity - - the old system has been destroyed , but the new rules and new standards are not yet completely set up .  Even though the new system has already been established , it does not yet get its due respect and lacks authority , and the so-called " democratic system " does not exist .  Rather , the politicians lack " democratic accomplishments , " and the sudden turnover of political parties has inevitably led to violent political , economic , and social upheaval .

It has set up a local area network for equipment management , a radio monitoring network , and so on .  
The rectification of work style and business conduct in various trades should also promote the transformation of government functions and the establishment of a set of incorruptible , highly efficient , well-coordinated , orderly , regular , open , and fair administrative systems and work mechanisms , thus creating a benign environment for the establishment of a orderly and regularized market economy .  
Such achievements have made an important contribution to the successful implementation of " the 9th five-year " plan in our region and the basic realization of developmental goals established at the third Tibet Work Forum set forth by the central authorities .  They have also created favorable conditions for carrying out the strategic goal of a leap forward in economic and social development in our region during the new period .

During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .

In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .

In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .

The work of setting up a visible construction market was further carried forward .  Visible construction markets were set up at all cities at region level and above except 14 that were approved not to be built , which effectively controlled corrupt dealings in building projects .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .

Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .

Zhu Rongji pointed out that to set up a unified , standard , and perfect national social security system , we must clearly understand and grasp the following few points : First , the social security system must actually be independent from enterprises and institutions .  Enterprises and institutions are only asked to pay social insurance premiums according to the law .  And they will no longer take on the routine duties of distributing basic social insurance expenses and managing the people with social security .  
In addition , regarding the 85 duty paragraphs of agricultural products which the US side is concerned about , the two sides agreed that the actual customs tariff of 30.8 percent at the signing of the agreement will be reduced to 14.5 percent in five years , the total amount of import quotas for wheat , rice , and corn set at 13 million tonnes in 2000 will be raised to 23 million tonnes in 2004 , and the business volume of non-state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be increased too .

As a matter of fact , it is impossible for the Chinese enterprises to head for the entire world without choice now .  We should first proceed from our own comparative advantages to select those regions that have their own comparative advantages , and make investment and set up factories there .  For instance , we should first gain access to the developing countries , the states of the former Soviet Union , the regions adjacent to West China , and so on .

Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .

Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
Now that attacking had become more of a challenge , the indigenous people organized 18 settlements together for a joint assault . The residents , fearing the aborigines would set the city wan alight , stacked up tens of oxcarts to build another wall outside the original one , and , after a fierce battle , finally pushed the attackers back into the hills .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
Loopholes in the law " The Voice of Taiwan " violated criminal laws , was investigated by the prosecutor 's office which found sufficient evidence to act , and then was closed down for its unlawful behavior . Meanwhile , the " Green Peace Taiwan Cultural Broadcasting Station " and " Taiwan News Transfer " have not been set up in accord with legal procedures . They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
The shadows cast by war are also reflected in the daily behavior of Chinese refugees from Vietnam . For example , they are used to life in the mountainous wilds , and even when a regular cooking range has been set up in their new billets , they simply leave it unused , for they prefer to pile up several slabs of stone for their cooking fire . And when food is distributed , they are not above snatching or hoarding for they are deadly afraid of not getting another meal .  
Unwilling to be disturbed , Lin refused to be interviewed . Reporters then camped out around her home . Some unfurled banners in protest , others went in a group with their publisher to present a " gift " of a golden Boddhisattva , and others also sent lavish presents . And some " set a new record for the Chinese media in America " by renting a helicopter to watch the wedding ceremony from the air , attracting disapproving stares from the local citizens and greatly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood .  
Adapted from a story in Lin Yu-tang 's Chinese Legends , The Arch is set in a remote village in southwest China , where a 34-year-old widow lives , dutifully supporting her mother-in-law and raising her only daughter - - as workers build a traditional arch attesting to the widow 's faithful and self-sacrificing behavior .  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
Under the assimilation policy , the Japanese issued the Taiwan education law , eliminated differential education , implemented the common study system , recognized improperly documented marriages , set basic principles for internal governance , and more .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
In 1932 China 's Minister of Industry Kung Ta , a 72nd generation descendant of Confucius , presented them as a gift to the school of journalism . And since the lions crossed the wide ocean and settled down in this foreign land , new arrivals who set their eyes on them usually gain the warm feeling of bumping into old friends in a strange place .  
To my surprise , the children all set to with enthusiasm , some painting a mothers ' singing group , some painting the accompanying orchestra , along with a blue sky , the green grass and red flowers of the park , and fountains , trees , butterflies and birds , to make a vivid , richly colorful picture .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
But recently , at the request of international organizations , the Directorate General of Telecommunications set up a weather balloon station on the island to monitor the upper atmosphere . To ensure that the data gathered is valid and accurate , the directorate also shipped a generator to the island to supply the equipment with electricity at a stable voltage .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
Sixteen years ago , surgery to separate Siamese twins Chung-jen and Chung-yi captivated the nation . The 12-hour operation produced the world 's first successful separation of male Siamese-twin infants joined at the hip and born with only three legs . Some of the many people crowded around TV sets set off firecrackers in celebration , or thanked providence .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
The decoration was no longer set off in panels , but composed in continuous scenes on the body of the pieces , and included landscapes with buildings and human characters , and narrative scenes from novels and plays . The designs stressed their Chineseness , and were tailored to the tastes of European consumers .  
Having been busy for a while , by the time they got set up for a formal takeoff they noticed the sky darkening . But it proved impossible for them to resist the seduction of flying . "  
The cans and bottles , with a thin layer of dirt and decayed leaves stuck to the bottom , have been picked up , but few of the onlookers realize yet that the real secret lies in the water inside the container . The two veterans at this game open their backpacks , take out a strainer and a small handled pan , and set to work .  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
The Huayu Foundation has held seven classics courses for children . Every time the kids come to class , they must first put on dark blue robes and bow in front of a statue of the great sage Confucius . Then , while sitting cross-legged at low tables , the class recites fluently in loud and clear voices from the works of the Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai , " I set myself to understand the ways of Heaven and Earth , and to bring peace and stability to the people .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
There 's nothing difficult about running an official publication : " Just handle it like a regular official document . " Topics were set out by the Printed Materials Department , which handled all government publications , and relevant agencies were asked for material and photographs .  
But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
" The artistic aura of Hou Hsiao-hsien 's The Puppet Master was similar in lighting and hue to that of the 17th Century Dutch painter Rembrandt . It needs to be illuminated with excellent facilities , " says Chiao . When screened in inadequately equipped theaters , the film is transformed into a murky block . The situation is even worse on a television set , whose ability to differentiate between strong and soft light is considerably inferior .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again . The idea of setting up something eternal by a short term effort emphasizes the idea of a panacea . The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
Han Pao-te , who now heads the preparatory office to set up the Tainan National College of the Arts , says that the Chinese were skilled in the use of water , which was the most common source of motive power . An example is the water wheels used to raise water for irrigation . " The astronomical clock tower represents Chinese water culture , and from the celestial globe and armillary sphere we can see the Chinese conception of the heavens , so they are an expression of the Chinese soul . "  
" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
The characters evolved from the elongated curved lines of the early zhuan ( seal ) script , to the square , flat style of li ( clerical ) script , to the simplified but ordered cao ( " free-flowing " or cursive ) script , up to the writing systems of today , the kai ( standard ) script and the xing ( " running " or semicursive ) script , stylistically set midpoint between cao and kai .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) . This replaced the former system of multiple exporters , and introduced a unified approach to the business , with global coordination covering every stage from improved cultivar selection to production , packing , cool storage , transport , shipping , overseas distribution , marketing and promotion , " says NZKMB new project manager Stuart Abbott .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
Vegetable substitutes for poultry , red meat , and all kinds of seafood can in fact taste even better than the real thing . Chinese have always set great store by selecting holiday foods that symbolize high hopes for the coming year . Thus over time many dishes have acquired auspicious sounding names designed to add to the festive atmosphere .  
Many people set themselves up as great religious masters , but their actions are quite at odds with their own teachings , " Sogyal Rinpoche says . He says a real master must be of a certain " lineage " through which teachings are transmitted to him . He must have a flawless character , and most importantly , has to be " selfless , " " compassionate " and " wise . " If people observe carefully , they should be able to tell the difference .  
Possibly the earliest story of rhododendron cultivation in China is set in the freewheeling days of the Zhen'guan reign ( 627-649 ) of the Tang dynasty . A penniless monk arrives at a monastery in southern China from faraway Mt . Tiantai in Zhejiang , asking for lodging . He is dressed in a simple robe , and carries with him a crock in which he has planted a red rhododendron , which he transplants at Helin Temple in Runzhou .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
ROCSAT-1 is set to be launched at the end of next year , and although the project is progressing smoothly at present , it is understood that because satellite technology is extremely complex , and aerospace is a vast industry which can not be established overnight , there are still many challenges to be faced .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
As well as Chinese stone lions from all over , lions from minority peoples are also here , making up for their small numbers by their distinctive appearance . A pair of lions from Yunnan , as tall as a man , have ears in curly shapes reminiscent of the stylized clouds of Chinese art , and protruding eyes more than three inches long set in deep sockets . The lioness 's long tongue lolls down against the mouth of her cub , which is stretched up on tiptoes to meet it .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
Mr . Koo did not avoid politically sensitive issues , clearly and unambiguously giving voice to the Republic of China 's political principles . And by avoiding the mainland 's trap , Mr . Koo expanded the scope of the dialogue to include the rights of the people and lured the mainland into agreeing to four points of consensus set by Taiwan . While working within the major differences outlined above , the two sides together sought out minor points to agree upon .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
As for the imperial clubs , according to The Book of Chuiwan they were edged with pure gold , inlaid with jade , and their shafts sumptuously decorated . When their majesties had finished playing , their equipment was not put away in bags , but placed in brocaded cases . Even today 's top-flight golf clubs , which sell for NT $ 800-900,000 a set , would look pretty shabby next to kit like this .  
He also felt that nanguan had gotten into a terrible rut with hackneyed , sentimental lyrics that did not speak to the concerns of modern society . He wrote lyrics for over 200 new songs which Zhuo then set to music . Among other themes , his songs described Singaporean scenes , delivered satirical commentary on social ills , and expressed the author 's own feelings .  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
In Anhui Province there was Ouyang Xiu 's self-effacingly named Pavilion of the Drunk Old Gentleman , where the mind of the aforementioned gentleman was preoccupied with scenic wonders rather than the next drink . The settings of these retreats reflected the aesthetic ideals of the literati and their detached approach to life , and it was these same people , the educated elite , who set the tone for national and local administration during the Song dynasty .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .  
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience . " If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
A temporary outdoor stage has been set up immediately opposite an Earth God temple . The purpose of hiring a drama troupe is to thank the gods for their benevolence and supplicate them for their continued good graces , but the audience is sparse , and the performers look rather uninspired . Tea-picking opera is only performed these days at an occasional temple function . Apart from the language , probably most people in Taiwan ca n't tell the difference between tea-picking opera and the ubiquitous Taiwanese opera .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
Some paddies are full of plants rising above the water to all different heights . Others are set aside just for lotus and water lily . Bits of clouds and blue sky reflect between the plants off the broken surface of the water . Plants of every description cover the raised earthen barriers between the different paddies , their tiny maroon , yellow , and white blossoms standing out brilliantly in the sun .  
In this way , the western part of the Southeast Asian littoral came within China 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , there were great profits to be had . Each expedition set out laden with silk and porcelain , to be exchanged for rare and precious commodities from overseas , and this too helps to explain why Zheng set sail on seven separate voyages .  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
For example , Chang Ta-chun rejects the idea that My Kid Sister and Wild Child are representative of his oeuvre . These were selected for translation mainly because the themes were more comprehensible to a foreign audience . " My other works , " he explains , " are about events or are set against backdrops peculiar to China or Taiwan , and would n't be easy to translate , much less be accessible to most American readers . "  
There is nothing in the main living area save a large desk covered with black plastic matting , a TV set , and mountainous piles of long sheets of calligraphy paper . But there are other signs as well . On the wall hangs a scroll , reading " Dragon flying , phoenix dancing , " done in a flowing , dynamic hand .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
" Passage for myself and several of the students on board a junk loaded with planks was engaged from Tamsui . We set out , but the winds were contrary , and after two days of tossing and seasickness we rounded the northern point of Formosa and ran into Kim-pau-li , on the northeast . Here we got water and food , for our supply was well-nigh exhausted .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
Much to his surprise , someone showed up in the middle of the night with bolt cutters and set him free . Fully awake to the treacherous intentions of his relatives , Wang decided to head for southern China and make a life there together with Yueh-ching , the sweet and innocent daughter of a tenant farmer . The two married , and warfare continued .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
The legend says that these former slaves later slaughtered a group of British soldiers who had landed on the island to explore it . When a British naval vessel discovered the soldiers ' fate , the sailors piled brush at the mouth of the cave in which the slaves were hiding , doused it in oil , and set it alight . The fire burned for three days , killing all of the several hundred slaves inside . This sad event is the origin of the cave 's name .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
One day , acting upon the advice of his ox , the Oxherd retrieved and hid an article of celestial garb he had come upon by the riverside . The Weaving Maid , unable to return to heaven because she no longer possessed her celestial garb , agreed to marry the earnest and straightforward Oxherd . With the husband tilling the fields and the wife weaving her cloth , the couple set about raising two sons .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
In the early ' 70s , his " Mourning the Moon " serigraph series was seen as the beginning of the second phase of his career . A sometimes-strong , sometimes-soft brush style took over from the coarse lines and geometric shapes of his earlier period . The " Large Calligraphy " series , executed with an airbrush , featured a combination of fascinating colors with an agile calligraphic style . The colorful Chinese characters set against a jet-black night sky are reminiscent of the fireworks of a traditional Chinese festival .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
The team she leads took the theme of " family reunion at Mid-Autumn Festival " as the basis to ingeniously integrate content from earth science ( the movement of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon ) , maths ( quadratic functions of Hou Yi shooting down the nine suns ) , history ( mid-autumn legends and the Mongol Empire ) , and counseling activities ( satisfactions and regrets in life ) , which they linked together in a set of thematic activities with a rich content .  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
If you come into the downtown area , the National Policy Foundation and the Taiwan Research Institute , set in the middle of the concrete jungle , would , on the other hand , be more reminiscent of the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution in Washington , with large numbers of retired government officials , and therefore tight security , in their modern office buildings .  
In its traditional form , qigui has always been quite a simple matter . You go to any temple , stand facing any one of the small sacred tortoises set out on display , light three incense sticks to respectfully inform the netherworld of your choice , and then cast the divining blocks ( two matching wooden blocks shaped like the halves of a cashew nut ) .  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
" Personal e-papers cover everything . It 's hard to imagine sometimes , but there are the minimum number of subscribers for all kinds of bizarre stuff , " says Sean Fu , CEO of the Internet Research Company , Maillist 's parent firm . For example , Maillist has even attracted more than 100 web users from mainland China to set up e-papers , some of which are devoted exclusively to attacking the idea of Taiwan independence , and even these are able to maintain the basic level of a hundred or more subscribers .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
Among the relics from Famen Temple , which is located in Fufeng County in Shaanxi Province , is a silver censer with gilded twin bee designs set in floral circlets . The royal family offered this exceptional item as an offering , though it had previously functioned as a scent container , or also as a decorative piece to hang upon a sedan chair .  
Thanks to Lukang 's early prosperity , which brought many arts and crafts masters from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China to teach in Taiwan , Lukang has always been famous throughout the island for its artisanship . In early days , when someone 's daughter was getting married , there was no more demonstrative gift than a complete set of traditional Lukang furniture inlaid with precious metals and shells .  
The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings . The seriousness with which the ritual was taken is evidenced by the fact that a central government official-Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Liu Wann-hong-served as master of ceremonies , with the Changhua County executive and the mayor of Lukang as his seconds .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
We 're not afraid of competition . The more people in Taiwan get into this industry the better , for strength comes from solidarity . " Eric Lee , president of Softstar Entertainment , a major local computer games company , says that companies such as Softstar , Wang Film and CGCG have already formed a strategic alliance . They have also set up an " academy of the new arts , " in which experienced industry workers teach courses in order to pass on their knowledge and skills as quickly as possible .  
According to the laws governing national health insurance , every five years a new set of rates should be calculated to cover the following five years . In addition , whenever the system 's reserve fund goes below the equivalent of medical costs for one month ( currently , that figure is about NT $ 250 billion ) , then the insurance rates can be raised automatically .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
But a year ago when RollCoCo launched another set of cartoon characters called CoCoPlay , featuring four cheeky children wearing animal-head masks , they immediately drew adverse comments such as " Not funny ! " or " Kill them off , do n't make any more ! " so they naturally stopped developing the characters .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House . Zhang pointed out that his film was set in the time immediately before the first Qin emperor had unified all of China . At that moment in history , it would have been impossible for people to foresee his eventual transformation into a tyrant ; therefore , the assassin is able to place trust in the emperor .  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
In charge of general medicine in the assembly hall is a Muslim woman doctor , wearing a beautiful tudong ( Muslim headscarf ) , gently asking each patient where it hurts . Across a lawn from the assembly hall , in a space where the dentist has set up , little children , fearful of having their teeth pulled , eyes filling with tears , seem anxious to escape . The doctor from Singapore , speaking to them in Malaysian , 70-80% of which is similar to Indonesian , stays busy trying to keep them mollified .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
Several older women , looking indescribably happy , start their hands and feet in perpetual motion , and in a short time the entire area has been completely cleaned , a gas stove has been set up , and vegetables have been washed and chopped . Before you know it , the aroma of fried rice-noodles begins to permeate the clinic site .  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year . His entire body turned red and swelled , itching set in , and he had to soak all evening in a tub despite the cold winter weather . While everyone else was enjoying the most festive night of the year , Lai suffered through the bleakest New Year 's Eve of his life .  
It is then spread onto the base . After it dries , it is polished using moistened emery paper . Another coat of lacquer is applied and polished , and the process is repeated a dozen times or so . The lacquer can then be worked using a number of techniques , such as painting , carving , and the application of inlaid designs , before being set to dry in a dark place .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
According to Zhang , the classic forms of the wuxia , or wandering swordsman , genre of Chinese film have already been defined . There are , for example , King Hu 's gentle and even feminine Zen-flavored aesthetics ; Chang Cheh 's tough exteriors that hide gentle hearts ; and even Ang Lee 's evocation of the boldness coupled with restraint central to Chinese culture . Zhang did n't want to replicate any of these , so in Hero he set out to define a new wuxia aesthetic .  
Making his home in Tainan , Shen set up a private academy and practiced medicine . With other literary enthusiasts , he also formed the Tungyin Society , the writings of which were filled with the nostalgia , grief , and resentment of men of standing forced into exile .  
After his understanding of the limits of the tensile and torsional strength of eggs , he used the principle of the screw to fashion an interlocking ring of five eggs .

While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .

If an international crime was to be designated as a qualified case of an international breach of law , there was a need for a special regime governing State responsibility , which must include a set of legal consequences going beyond the consequences of ordinary wrongful acts and which must put the instrumental consequences of the crime under the supervision of a judicial authority .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change .

The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .

Also decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 2,618,600 dollars gross ( 2,217,800 dollars net ) for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,966,500 United States dollars gross ( 1,858,600 dollars net ) , for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 ;

effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
is evident that the continuation of this kind of irresponsible unilateral conduct and arrogant behaviour by the United States Government will set an alarming precedent with far-reaching adverse implications for international peace and security and create uncertainty and insecurity in international relations , for which the United States alone must bear full responsibility .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
Above and beyond the creation of a dense industrial network , the direct involvement of the State in economic management has made it possible for us to take on the considerable and manifold needs of a population deprived of essentials in the areas of education , health , jobs and housing and to set up an infrastructure even in the remotest corners of our vast territory .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course of national and international endeavours for sustainable development in the light of economic , social and environmental goals and in reaffirmation of the importance of obtaining new and additional resources to finance the plan of action to be adopted .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the Summit , containing an important set of commitments and recommendations to be implemented , became a historic landmark that established the international consensus on the goals to be pursued and achieved in the area of social development for the coming decades .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Certainly , the logic of evolution and the rules of transformation indicate that the stages of change carry within them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry , unless an objective and conducive environment exists , accompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of highly advanced values that are crystallized through coordinated and concerted efforts . 
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
We would have preferred that the draft resolution set down as its principal operative conclusion a firm call on the international community to consider further the fundamental and challenging questions that the advisory opinion poses .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session . 
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
The facts revealed since this aircraft began to be used , as set out in our aforementioned letters , in addition to the ill repute the aircraft has acquired following earlier spy flights over other parts of the world , require that the United Nations re-examine the issue of continued forcible use of the aircraft by the United States of America to violate Iraq 's airspace in a manner totally incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as they relate to respect for the sovereignty of all Member States .  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
Therefore , paragraph 4 of the draft resolution stated that the General Assembly noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of indebtedness , stressed that non-payment of undisputed debts reflected badly on the entire diplomatic community , reaffirmed that non-compliance with contractual obligations could not be justified or condoned , and endorsed the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;

A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Instead of tackling the underlying economic policy of the Government , they recognized the importance of sustained economic and social development to the consolidation of social peace and national reconciliation and included a " minimum platform " of commitments which would set this process in motion .

The facts that have come to light since this aircraft was first brought into use , which are set forth in our aforementioned letter , and the ill repute the aircraft has acquired from its past espionage activities in various parts of the world , make it incumbent upon the United Nations to re-examine the question of using an aircraft that is being employed by the United States of America in a coercive manner to violate Iraq 's airspace and to spy on Iraq for purposes other than those of the Special Commission .  
We believe that the Albanian operation has set a significant precedent for potential future interventions by the international community in cases where a State is gripped by a complex crisis with serious humanitarian implications and political repercussions for its neighbours .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .

During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
At the international level , the action plan defined a specific set of complementary actions designed to re-establish the necessary priority for improving agriculture and the rural economy , including two high-profile initiatives .  
The enclosed document , which is prepared on the basis of objective analysis and official sources , intends to set the record straight on a wide range of issues , and thus contribute to a better understanding of the prevailing situations , the facts about the conflict and the general environment surrounding the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict .  
It should be easy to understand why the Government of the Republic of Burundi objects to the talks being held in the United Republic of Tanzania , the fundamental reason for this objection being the current tension resulting from the problems caused by the refugee camps set up all along the shared border by the United Republic of Tanzania , just a dozen or so kilometres from Burundi , which are regularly used as bases for bloody incursions into Burundi territory . 
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
The facts that have come to light since this aircraft was first brought into use , which are set forth in our aforementioned letter , and the ill repute the aircraft has acquired from its past espionage activities in various parts of the world make it incumbent upon the United Nations to re-examine the question of using an aircraft that is being employed by the United States of America in a coercive manner to violate Iraq 's airspace and to spy on Iraq for purposes other than those of the Special Commission .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members .

However , a hasty prohibition of landmines not accompanied by measures to strengthen stability , could have a negative impact , including on anti-terrorist activities .  The proper forum for the discussion of the subject of landmines is the Conference on Disarmament , where it is possible to carry out an in-depth study and discussion of the entire set of respective problems , including from the standpoint of their impact on the strengthening the security of interested States and international security in general .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the areas of education , literacy and health , in particular maternal and child health , and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented by measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .

Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session an item entitled " Convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament " and , in the light of the outcome of the deliberations at the 1998 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to set an exact date for and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session .  * On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries .

Other national legislation relevant to the regime governing the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes article 7 of the Civil Code concerning defamation , providing that upon decision of a court , the mass medium concerned and the officials or citizens responsible shall make compensation in the degree set by the court for moral ( non-property ) injury caused to a citizen as a result of the dissemination by the mass media of inaccurate information damaging to his honour , dignity or business reputation .  
The system of financial assistance for returnees had set the stage for these changes as early as 1982 , but it was not until 1986 with the introduction of strict controls on foreigners ' entry and stay in France and widespread identity checks , that all immigrant groups were designated as potentially responsible for everything wrong with French society , an attitude which encouraged a particularly disturbing racist and xenophobic movement in France , especially at the electoral level . 
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5.6 million dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 dollars gross ( 10-million dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
In its paragraph 5 , Part I , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of action recalled that All human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and , in paragraph 98 , Part II , that to strengthen the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , additional approaches should be examined , such as a system of indicators to measure progress in the realization of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
In order to lay the foundations of this program and set it in motion , we should consider holding an international meeting with the participation of the relevant agencies of the system , regional organs and the respective national programmes of the countries concerned .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .  
In 1885 , when Africa was being colonized , my country was set up as a State that was the personal property of the King of the Belgians ; it endured violence and blatant violations of human rights connected inter alia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds of forced labour . 
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .  
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
During his tenure of office , thanks to his outstanding leadership and his remarkable managerial skill , the Agency has developed into an international body of exemplary effectiveness and efficiency , faithfully fulfilling the objectives and principles set out in the Agency 's statute .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
The project has assembled a set of cross-nationally comparable depersonalized microdata sets based on the 1990 round of national population and housing censuses , which will be used to study the social and economic conditions of older persons in a selected number of ECE member countries .  
At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .

Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .

In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
In addition , it is often argued that minimum wages in developing countries are distortionary , because they are set too high relative to the average income , thus raising production costs in the formal sector and discouraging employment .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
On balance the amount of progress achieved is discouraging : the interminable debates that take place in Parliament are repeated in CNE , as demonstrated by the two months required to elect its bureau and the failure to establish regional commissions ( that of Kinshasa was set up in August ) .  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .

First , while the earlier debate was characterized largely by fears of important contradictions between trade and environment policies , the post-UNCED debate has focused on exploring the scope of the complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection , and has enlarged the development dimension in the discussion on most issues .  Conceptual and empirical analyses and debate have helped to set aside some of the early fears of incompatibility between trade and environment policies which could have induced inappropriate policy choices .  
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .

In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .

The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion .

Article 6 was deemed to provide an important clarification ; indeed it was stated that , while the Commissions work on a comprehensive set of articles on prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities deserved full support , other rules and developments in that area of international law should be admitted , and it was important not to make premature commitments concerning the subject .  
A view was expressed that the 1998 split session had been a success since the Commission had completed both the set of 17 draft articles on prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities and the draft guidelines on reservations to treaties and had offered the possibility to legal advisers of permanent missions at New York to observe the work of the Commission and to meet its members .

As to the exact way in which the notion of an accessory right might be expressed in paragraph ( 1 ) , while the concern was expressed that the second set of bracketed language might be circular , it was agreed that it was preferable , since it left the question of the accessory or independent nature of the security right to law applicable outside the draft Convention .

The Commission recognized that setting time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment would give a strong signal of the increased priority to be accorded to the objective of full employment . 7 In the past many countries have set targets for the intermediate goals of reduction of inflation or for the rate of economic growth but few set targets for the centrally important goal of employment growth and linked them with strategies for their achievement . 
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .

Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
The religious leaders emphasized the peaceful co-existence of the two communities , but with the other two groups focused on the tragic events in January / February 1998 that set the stage in Bahr-el-Ghazal for the worst humanitarian crisis culminating in the deadliest famine since 1988 , when an estimated 250,000 people were killed , and in massive population displacement .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
This will provide an obvious opportunity for country teams , which so desire , to pursue several objectives at the same time lightening the burden on national officials by having fewer evaluations , concentrating on fewer and more important issues and using only one set of procedures ; increasing focus on , and understanding at the national level , of the overall contribution of the United Nations system ; economizing on scarce resources allocated for monitoring and evaluation .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
In late 1998 , the firm Veng S.A . was set up with the aim of developing new-generation space vehicles through unconventional mechanisms of financing by the private sector and scientific and technological bodies .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
A staff member , other than one recruited specifically for a mission , who has completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who has a permanent appointment and who is called upon to serve in the armed forces of the State of which the staff member is a national , whether for training or active duty , may be granted special leave without pay for the duration of such military service , in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in appendix C to these Rules .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
It had set the basis for a forward-looking organization that is flexible , innovative and proactive , able to implement policies and programmes effectively around shared goals , transparent and accountable in its dealings with donors , developing countries and people around the world , and equipped for fruitful partnerships with the rest of the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
It called upon members and associate members that have not yet done so to set up and strengthen national mechanisms on ageing , inter alia , to enable them to coordinate the observance of the International Year of Older Persons , and to set specific time-bound targets on ageing and related issues , in the light of the needs and aspirations of older persons , in keeping with indigenous traditions and their milieux .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
They agreed that strategic and policy analysis relevant to the peace-building and development objectives set out in the report would be more systematically shared among them , and directed all the Committees subsidiary bodies and other relevant inter-agency mechanisms to give special attention to ways of pursuing the objectives set in the report .  
It was the first instrument in the world to set forth a list of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations .  
From my perspective as a former President of the CD , I am inclined more and more to consider the Presidential troika mechanism as a tool in resolving complicated procedural issues , such as the establishment of a subsidiary body , as exemplified by its activities last year , and not as suitable for the conduct of regular discussions on one concrete issue and its set of closely related aspects .  
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
Without energetic implementation both at the national and the international level , however , the insight gained will not lead to the aims set ; at a minimum this includes the reduction of the number of undernourished people to half their 1996 level by 2015 .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time-frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
It should be mentioned that following consultations with non-governmental organizations acting in the field of HIV / AIDS and representatives of United Nations agencies working in Romania , it was decided to set up a national multisectoral AIDS commission to examine the potential spread of AIDS and its consequences for the Romanian population and to assess the programmes developed so far with a view to working out a national strategy against this dreadful malady .  
On the basis of the Cairo Programme of Action , Benin has developed a strategy we call the common minimum social welfare programme , aimed at improving the quality of life of families and covering a set of basic needs in five essential areas : health , education , food , developing people 's ability to create wealth , and opening up communities . 
We also reaffirm that , as set forth at the Fourth World Conference on Women , we are determined to promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services .  
However , I am of the firm belief that with our strong conviction and commitment , coupled with the wide and constructive participation of all relevant actors and with the support of the international community , we will be able to achieve our common objectives , as set out in the ICPD recommendations .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
Furthermore , at a time when the economic and demographic situation is a global issue , it is important to strengthen international cooperation in this inevitable process of globalization and to exchange ideas and know-how , in the spirit of consensus-building , in order to reach the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life of present and future generations set by the ICPD .  
Achieving the multiplicity of goals set at various conferences such as Agenda 21 , the Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States and the Cairo Programme of Action is not easy , but we can fully realize that objective if the international community , international financial institutions , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and national Governments together make a firm and collaborative commitment to such a worthy undertaking .  
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
Rather , its task was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .

The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
As a result of this consensus , there is now no more room for promoting one set of rights as against another , or putting forward some rights , such as economic and social , to be fulfilled prior to or in violation of civil and political rights , or vice versa .  
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
This joint session , to be attended by senior PA officials and representatives of the donor community , would aim to present a coherent set of technical assistance activities identified by the PA and to attract the interest of potential donors to UNCTAD and UNDP proposals . 
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
It provides a basic set of contractual provisions which can ensure that electronic commercial transactions may subsequently be concluded by commercial partners within a sound legal framework .  
As a Latin American , and in particular a South American , I wish to extend a fraternal greeting to the delegation of Ecuador , a country which presided over the General Assembly 's First Committee a few years ago , a co _ participant in the Tlatelolco Treaty regime , a nation which has recently set an historic example by peacefully settling a bilateral dispute within the strict observance of international law , thereby consolidating the pacific vocation of our region . 
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
The representative further stated that it would be a great misfortune for the defenders of human rights if a precedent was set whereby any non-governmental organization involved in a technical-procedural error was to be punished unduly on the basis of one specific case .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
The General Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the item also be considered directly in plenary for the sole purpose of taking action on the draft resolution entitled Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women recommended to the General Assembly for its adoption by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1999 / 13 of 28 July 1999 , on the understanding that this would not set a precedent .  
In the five months that have elapsed , many people have registered to participate , and the Government has selected 181 of them ; dates have been set and postponed ; venues have been selected and changed ; the proposed facilitators referred to earlier have visited the country ; and three committees have been established .  However , a national debate has yet to be held , and only the Organizational Committee is in operation .  
Furthermore , the Committee agreed on a detailed set of recommendations addressed to national parliaments on strengthening parliamentary input into the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session .  
By paying attention to the needs for a concerted action of the international community to address the regional dimensions of the root causes of conflict , the chapter calls for a coordinated regional approach that should be based on a set of agreed principles .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
The main functions of the Division will be to plan and monitor the economic and social reconstruction of East Timor , in close consultation with the East Timorese ; to prepare and evaluate policies and to set up institutions in the economic , social and financial fields ; and to coordinate with the various donors and international financial institutions the resource mobilization efforts of UNTAET .  
The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives , recognized as legal entities , are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises , and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
The specific commitments from developing countries and the donor community to expand basic social services called for at the international meeting on the 20 / 20 initiative held at Hanoi were essential to realizing the goals set at Beijing and Cairo .  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
Calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Turning to the issue of human resources development , he said that ILO considered that there was an urgent need to set in place active labour market policies to help workers cope with the growing problems of job loss and redeployment .  Training and re-training programmes , job search assistance , vocational counselling and access to good labour market information were all essential .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Above all , it was vital that children and young people should be involved in the discussions and actions which sought to improve their social environment and set minimum international living standards for children .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
The wave of economic and corporate restructurings undertaken to respond to an increasingly competitive global market and the widespread dismantling of social security systems have resulted in unemployment , work insecurity and worsening labour conditions giving rise to violations of core economic and social rights set forth in articles 6 to 9 of the Covenant .  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
Also calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
It was proposed that two types of recommendations could normally be addressed to States parties by the Subcommittee : ( a ) those for more or less speedy implementation by the States parties themselves ; and ( b ) those which were supposed to be progressively implemented by the States parties through technical assistance and cooperation financed by the special fund to be set up pursuant to article 17 .  
The Subcommittee , while respecting the principles set out in article 3 , is encouraged to cooperate for the prevention of torture in general with the relevant United Nations organs and mechanisms as well as international , regional and national institutions or organizations working towards strengthening the protection of persons from torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights36 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
So the systemic contest was founded on a similar set of proclaimed values or objectives : rationality , efficiency and equity on a general level , and modernization , growth and an improved living standard for the majority on a more concrete level .  
The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
The task of the Working Group was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered , and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .  
The special session had adopted by consensus a document that identified key measures for the further implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action ( A / S-21 / 5 / Add . 1 ) , which validated the comprehensive approach to population and development issues and provided a set of new interim benchmarks for achievement of the goals of the Conference and reduction of vulnerability to human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments are all based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The expert group agreed that the Ombudsman Institute would be set up primarily to protect the rights and freedoms of all legal entities in Kosovo , by monitoring the activity of the Interim Civil Administration and emerging local institutions prior to and following provisional elections .  
The third issue raised by ICRC concerned the proposal of the Secretary-General that further analysis would be needed to identify the extent to which the human rights abuses which are most prevalent in situations of internal violence can be attributed to the proper and faithful application of derogation clauses set out in international treaties .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Therefore , ITU member States , to facilitate peaceful relations , international cooperation and economic and social development among nations through good operation of telecommunications , have set up a specialized agency of the United Nations ( now with a membership of over 186 ) and adopted the relevant legal documents .  
We hope that this omission will not set a negative precedent in the future , because we consider such a provision to be necessary to guarantee the effective and independent functioning of the Organization , particularly with respect to a Mission that is expected to be financed mainly through voluntary contributions .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
For areas considered non-core ( i.e . , not essential for regulation at the central common system level ) , guidelines set by ICSC could be desirable .  
Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal entities carrying out activities or located in its territory or organized under its laws may be held liable when they have , with the full knowledge of one or more persons responsible for their management or control , benefitted from or committed offences set forth in article 2 .  
Thus we need to set aside the residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc security umbrellas with a new and innovative concept of global security networking , an inclusive and participatory system which uses the existing mechanisms in a complementary rather than competing scheme .  
We will soon be celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing , and the Government of Chile believes that on that occasion in 2002 the international community will have to meet to analyse the progress made and set long-term guidelines and strategies for the coming years , years which , demographic trends indicate , will be characterized by a continuous ageing of our population . 
For too many countries , the target of halving poverty by the year 2015 has proved elusive , and indeed , the President of the World Bank and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) appear to have confirmed , at their recent meeting in Washington , that the goals which the international community had set itself for such important social services as health and housing will not be fulfilled as expected .  
The main purpose of these conferences , held with the direct and active participation of young people , was to raise the general publics awareness of the goals set and the commitments undertaken by Governments , to promote dialogue with the decision makers on follow-ups and to encourage an active involvement of young people , civil society and the local governments in the implementation of the relevant national plans of action .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
The main task of this programme is to set up specific mechanisms aimed at the implementation of the principles of a socially oriented economy and at the enhancement of social policy based on the efficient use of existing resources .  
In implementing that resolution the two institutions set up cooperative machinery , thanks to a cooperative agreement designed to strengthen their ties on issues of common interest , notably in the political , economic , scientific and cultural areas .  
In the light of extensive measures under way to firmly set the University for Peace on a strong platform , adequate and proportionate financial support from various sources is required .  
In a world still governed by a narrow realism , sometimes sterile but always destructive , it is clear that those who envisage a better future for humanity will have much to do to definitively set in motion the dynamic of change that is so necessary for sustainable human development .  
We are convinced that the world Organization is the primary body responsible not only for the maintenance of international peace and security , but also for humanitarian assistance and for economic and social development , as set out in the Charter .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
Despite the budgetary difficulties caused by the drop in official development assistance in the past few years , Spain has held its contribution to the Population Fund steady since 1995 and , bearing in mind the stimulus this special session has given the Cairo Programme of Action and the importance of the objectives we have set ourselves , Spain is studying the possibility of increasing its contribution to the Population Fund over the next few years .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
We set ourselves both quantitative and qualitative goals and accepted that their achievement would not only require the commitment and actions of individual nations , but would also pivot on a new global partnership among all the world ' s countries and peoples , based on a sense of shared but differentiated responsibility for each other and for our planetary home .

This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
The objective of the present guidelines is to provide advice to Governments and set out broad principles on which national cooperative policy might best be based , recognizing that more specific and detailed national policies fall within the responsibility of each Government .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .

This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
In similar fashion , better efforts should be made to achieve improved relations between States , not only because this is mandated in the Charter , but also because it is viewed as essential to the global realization of human rights as indicated in article 28 of the Universal Declaration : quite clearly an international order that is generating terrorist acts hardly qualifies as a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in th [ e ] Declaration can be fully realized . 
The special session of the General Assembly on children was expected to produce a global agenda with a set of goals and a plan of action devoted to ensuring three essential outcomes : the best start in life for all children , good-quality basic education for all children and opportunities for all children , especially adolescents ( who fall into the age cohort of youth ) , for meaningful participation in their communities .

The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .  
A Commission for Social and Human Development has been set up and five key elements for the development policy have been defined : to satisfy at least the minimum requirement of Mexicans with respect to food , housing and education ; to apply a measure of equity in all government policies ; to focus on the population living in extreme poverty , particularly indigenous peoples ; to promote social cohesion and community spirit ; and to protect the environment .  
In his view , the outcomes from the four expert meetings dealt with items which were both central elements of UNCTADs mandate as set out in the Bangkok Plan of Action , as well as constituting key issues on the international trade agenda and subject to intensive multilateral negotiation or review in the WTO .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Reaffirming that , as declared in article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration can be fully realized and that , as declared in article 25 , paragraph 1 , everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Based on these principles , a set of new concepts has emerged and started to take form : a new security concept which consists in mutual trust , disarmament and cooperative security ; a new type of international relationship which centres on partnership and non-alignment ; and a new model of regional cooperation in which all countries , large or small , jointly take the initiative in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation .  
It is our hope that the country concerned will work out a comprehensive and practical destruction programme as soon as possible in accordance with its obligations under the Convention , which should guarantee the safety of the local people and the environment so that the substantive destruction process can be started and the grave danger posed by the abandoned chemical weapons can be eliminated within the time frame set forth in the Convention .  
However , deregulation without accompanying measures , such as the establishment of professional bodies ( haulier associations ) to set professional standards and maintain discipline among members , could create a vacuum which could be exploited by unscrupulous operators engaging in illicit or illegal practices .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
To this end like other countries Burkina Faso has set itself the objective of general and complete disarmament under international control an objective that should be pursued using a carefully balanced approach , accompanied by consistent measures .  
Recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of youth and youth organizations at the local , national , regional and international levels in promoting and implementing the World Programme of Action and in evaluating the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation and of the need to support the activities of youth mechanisms that have been set up by youth and youth organizations , bearing in mind that young people are active agents for positive change and development in society ;  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .

By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
Once , in an organized on-the-spot driving training , little banners , one after another , slowly transmitted commanding information , while more than 100 vehicles , in a noisy disorder , were unable to set out on time , which resulted in a delay of training time and frequent signs of accidents .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .

People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .

Moreover , the information industry has tempting development prospects - - with a simple additional accessory , a television set can be connected to the Internet , which provides access to on-line shopping , stock market news , remote medical service , remote learning , and other services .  
" Go ! "  No sooner had the group leader issued an order in a low , deep voice than the " special combat " soldiers set out by crawling out of the green curtain of tall crops .  In the twinkling of an eye , they submerged in the lake .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .

To effectively solve this problem , the division has conducted research on simulated high-plateau oxygen-deficient training in light of training troops with science and technology in recent years , and has summed up a complete set of methods for physical training .  As a result , routine training has basically produced the actual results of similar training in places over 4,500 m above the sea level , where only half of the normal oxygen content is in the air .  
Besides , some websites set up columns to spread things with feudal , superstitious , pornographic , obscene , and disheartening contents .  All these things may sap the people 's will , corrode the people 's soul , and produce an even worse impact on young people , who account for the majority of the Internet users .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
In this regard , Zhang Li proposed that facing the situation of China 's accession to the WTO soon , the educational sector at the government level should take the work of research , exposition , and verification as a matter of great urgency , use the experience of the 40 countries that have joined the education trade agreement for reference , set up a special organ to coordinate pertinent departments , and begin the procedure of making initial preparations .

Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?

The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .

In the process of moving from underdevelopment to prosperity , the simple , unspoilt Polynesians were not as good at business as the Chinese - - the French government helped them set up a consumer coop , but it had to shut down , while the Chinese were spread over all the islands , forming a broad commercial network that even the French themselves could n't compete with .  
Some of the demands overlap with standard government regulations , but even more of them are based on special local needs , such as a requirement that the firm adhere to effluent standards higher than the national standard , that an environmental impact statement be drawn up , that an inspection team be set up , that the factory reach certain standards within a certain period of time or else be shut down .  
" They used to say if you took tonic food on winter 's day it would set you up for the whole winter ahead , " recalls Mrs . Ts'ao , 70 . On winter 's day in Hunan we ate chicken with herbal decoctions and ground glutinous rice " to make the soil soft and easy to plough the next year . "  
Kenting , situated in the south of Taiwan , has a tropical climate , with ferocious mosquitoes , poisonous snakes and a fierce summer sun . Liu always went off to wait for them before dawn , before the monkeys had set out from home to romp and forage for food , returning only at dusk . He often waited in the forest for eight or nine hours and only sighted the monkeys at sunrise .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
American fast food came to Taiwan in 1984 in the shape of McDonald 's , whose first Taipei outlet achieved a record turnover for the worldwide chain in the first week of opening . They not only encouraged other Western fast food businesses to set up shop here , but also set the pace for local fast food outlets such as Chicken House , Ting Kua Kua and Han Hua , whose common features are based on McDonald 's example of clean , bright surroundings , hygienic food and speedy service with a smile .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics . We need the government to set up a seed source bank to preserve these , while at the same time encouraging private enterprise to develop new improved varieties .  
Three years ago she selected a suitably attractive area set against the hills , called Three Corner Lake , and harried the relevant local departments into building an activities center and restaurant there , for the reception of visitors .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
In the first year after it was founded , the Yangshan foundation held lectures and workshops on aboriginal culture , and on the theory and practice of field research .

The offending concrete was removed and the soil changed , with the result that old roots have begun to bud anew , and there seems to be hope for the survival of the tree .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
Market Expansion : Money is rolling in at these companies that match people up , the credit for which really belongs to those far-sighted entrepreneurs who broadened the " market . " Besides serving the young unmarried men and women of Taiwan , there are now introductions for friendship and marriage across the Taiwan Straits , as well as transnational special columns for Chinese abroad ; the age levels have been broadened to include the " second spring " of divorced or widowed persons , as well as " September romances " for the silver haired set .  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "

Long ago , the busy striving for thoroughness in business and the hectic pace of life led Chen to turn to Confucian principles as an extremely human and practical set of cultural beliefs . He feels sorry that he can not get other modern people to accept them as well .  
Little did people expect that the economy was brittle , and an unprecedentedly severe recession set in . The unemployment rate , including that for high level positions , rose dramatically , and housing prices collapsed . Many people who had had stable incomes were laid off or took paycuts . Moreover , bank interest rates showed a large increase , and monthly payments thus began to exceed people 's budgets .  
To encourage people to participate and understand that bats are nothing to be afraid of , they set up bat-appreciation spots . These are places where people can go near the mouth of a cave in the evening and see one of nature 's most spectacular and lively sights - - bats leaving the roost . The societies also teach people how to build bat feeders to attract suburban bats and allow them to happily live in a human environment .  
Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy . If you just give them a chance , they can escape from the traditional recalcitrant attitude of ' having one more thing to do is not as good as having one less thing to do . ' '  
Chinese ho-yuan could be connected together or divided up , " he explains . After a large family subdivides and each member forms his own family , one need only close the side doors of the rooms ; the main compound and the hulung , or auxiliary rooms set off to the left and right of the main com pound ( separated by an open-air pathway ) , can then become two independent bodies .

Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
Critics hold that Red Sorghum , which carries the mysterious colors of silence on the vast northern plain on which it is set and describes a strong northern man taking a wife , and Judou , which describes the melancholy of a beautiful women suppressing her sexuality , are both " packaged in exoticness . "  
In particular , though there are now many large corporations , many of these were built up from scratch by hard-working and frugal entrepreneurs . It would just be too painful for them to lay out the large amount of cash required to bring in an environmental engineering firm to install a full set of equipment .  
The government has set up a treatment plant for highly concentrated electroplating fluid in the Taichung area , and it is encouraging operators to use collective methods to turn their waste water over to specialists for disposal . Yet there are those who would rather sneak around and evade legal restraints .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
The hard-won joys of bird photographyPhotographing the black-faced spoonbill is arduous work . To avoid disturbing the birds , one must set up a hide in their habitat . Crouching in the camouflaged tent or wading through the black fetid mud with the cold seawater chilling one to the bone , exposed to the force of the bitter northeast wind , is something which is hard to describe with mere words to someone who has not experienced it himself .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
Now that attacking had become more of a challenge , the indigenous people organized 18 settlements together for a joint assault . The residents , fearing the aborigines would set the city wan alight , stacked up tens of oxcarts to build another wall outside the original one , and , after a fierce battle , finally pushed the attackers back into the hills .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
Loopholes in the law " The Voice of Taiwan " violated criminal laws , was investigated by the prosecutor 's office which found sufficient evidence to act , and then was closed down for its unlawful behavior . Meanwhile , the " Green Peace Taiwan Cultural Broadcasting Station " and " Taiwan News Transfer " have not been set up in accord with legal procedures . They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
The shadows cast by war are also reflected in the daily behavior of Chinese refugees from Vietnam . For example , they are used to life in the mountainous wilds , and even when a regular cooking range has been set up in their new billets , they simply leave it unused , for they prefer to pile up several slabs of stone for their cooking fire . And when food is distributed , they are not above snatching or hoarding for they are deadly afraid of not getting another meal .  
Unwilling to be disturbed , Lin refused to be interviewed . Reporters then camped out around her home . Some unfurled banners in protest , others went in a group with their publisher to present a " gift " of a golden Boddhisattva , and others also sent lavish presents . And some " set a new record for the Chinese media in America " by renting a helicopter to watch the wedding ceremony from the air , attracting disapproving stares from the local citizens and greatly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood .  
Adapted from a story in Lin Yu-tang 's Chinese Legends , The Arch is set in a remote village in southwest China , where a 34-year-old widow lives , dutifully supporting her mother-in-law and raising her only daughter - - as workers build a traditional arch attesting to the widow 's faithful and self-sacrificing behavior .  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
Under the assimilation policy , the Japanese issued the Taiwan education law , eliminated differential education , implemented the common study system , recognized improperly documented marriages , set basic principles for internal governance , and more .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
In 1932 China 's Minister of Industry Kung Ta , a 72nd generation descendant of Confucius , presented them as a gift to the school of journalism . And since the lions crossed the wide ocean and settled down in this foreign land , new arrivals who set their eyes on them usually gain the warm feeling of bumping into old friends in a strange place .  
To my surprise , the children all set to with enthusiasm , some painting a mothers ' singing group , some painting the accompanying orchestra , along with a blue sky , the green grass and red flowers of the park , and fountains , trees , butterflies and birds , to make a vivid , richly colorful picture .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
But recently , at the request of international organizations , the Directorate General of Telecommunications set up a weather balloon station on the island to monitor the upper atmosphere . To ensure that the data gathered is valid and accurate , the directorate also shipped a generator to the island to supply the equipment with electricity at a stable voltage .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
Sixteen years ago , surgery to separate Siamese twins Chung-jen and Chung-yi captivated the nation . The 12-hour operation produced the world 's first successful separation of male Siamese-twin infants joined at the hip and born with only three legs . Some of the many people crowded around TV sets set off firecrackers in celebration , or thanked providence .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
The decoration was no longer set off in panels , but composed in continuous scenes on the body of the pieces , and included landscapes with buildings and human characters , and narrative scenes from novels and plays . The designs stressed their Chineseness , and were tailored to the tastes of European consumers .  
Having been busy for a while , by the time they got set up for a formal takeoff they noticed the sky darkening . But it proved impossible for them to resist the seduction of flying . "  
The cans and bottles , with a thin layer of dirt and decayed leaves stuck to the bottom , have been picked up , but few of the onlookers realize yet that the real secret lies in the water inside the container . The two veterans at this game open their backpacks , take out a strainer and a small handled pan , and set to work .  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
The Huayu Foundation has held seven classics courses for children . Every time the kids come to class , they must first put on dark blue robes and bow in front of a statue of the great sage Confucius . Then , while sitting cross-legged at low tables , the class recites fluently in loud and clear voices from the works of the Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai , " I set myself to understand the ways of Heaven and Earth , and to bring peace and stability to the people .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
There 's nothing difficult about running an official publication : " Just handle it like a regular official document . " Topics were set out by the Printed Materials Department , which handled all government publications , and relevant agencies were asked for material and photographs .  
But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
" The artistic aura of Hou Hsiao-hsien 's The Puppet Master was similar in lighting and hue to that of the 17th Century Dutch painter Rembrandt . It needs to be illuminated with excellent facilities , " says Chiao . When screened in inadequately equipped theaters , the film is transformed into a murky block . The situation is even worse on a television set , whose ability to differentiate between strong and soft light is considerably inferior .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again . The idea of setting up something eternal by a short term effort emphasizes the idea of a panacea . The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
Han Pao-te , who now heads the preparatory office to set up the Tainan National College of the Arts , says that the Chinese were skilled in the use of water , which was the most common source of motive power . An example is the water wheels used to raise water for irrigation . " The astronomical clock tower represents Chinese water culture , and from the celestial globe and armillary sphere we can see the Chinese conception of the heavens , so they are an expression of the Chinese soul . "  
" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
The characters evolved from the elongated curved lines of the early zhuan ( seal ) script , to the square , flat style of li ( clerical ) script , to the simplified but ordered cao ( " free-flowing " or cursive ) script , up to the writing systems of today , the kai ( standard ) script and the xing ( " running " or semicursive ) script , stylistically set midpoint between cao and kai .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) . This replaced the former system of multiple exporters , and introduced a unified approach to the business , with global coordination covering every stage from improved cultivar selection to production , packing , cool storage , transport , shipping , overseas distribution , marketing and promotion , " says NZKMB new project manager Stuart Abbott .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
Vegetable substitutes for poultry , red meat , and all kinds of seafood can in fact taste even better than the real thing . Chinese have always set great store by selecting holiday foods that symbolize high hopes for the coming year . Thus over time many dishes have acquired auspicious sounding names designed to add to the festive atmosphere .  
Many people set themselves up as great religious masters , but their actions are quite at odds with their own teachings , " Sogyal Rinpoche says . He says a real master must be of a certain " lineage " through which teachings are transmitted to him . He must have a flawless character , and most importantly , has to be " selfless , " " compassionate " and " wise . " If people observe carefully , they should be able to tell the difference .  
Possibly the earliest story of rhododendron cultivation in China is set in the freewheeling days of the Zhen'guan reign ( 627-649 ) of the Tang dynasty . A penniless monk arrives at a monastery in southern China from faraway Mt . Tiantai in Zhejiang , asking for lodging . He is dressed in a simple robe , and carries with him a crock in which he has planted a red rhododendron , which he transplants at Helin Temple in Runzhou .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
ROCSAT-1 is set to be launched at the end of next year , and although the project is progressing smoothly at present , it is understood that because satellite technology is extremely complex , and aerospace is a vast industry which can not be established overnight , there are still many challenges to be faced .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
In an industrial society , as extended families living under one roof have given way to smaller and smaller nuclear families , the family can no longer serve the same functions it once did in supporting the needs of all segments of the population . Yet traditional Eastern attitudes , morality and values rooted in thousands of years of history are not easy to change , and they have a big effect on how policy toward the elderly is set .  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
As well as Chinese stone lions from all over , lions from minority peoples are also here , making up for their small numbers by their distinctive appearance . A pair of lions from Yunnan , as tall as a man , have ears in curly shapes reminiscent of the stylized clouds of Chinese art , and protruding eyes more than three inches long set in deep sockets . The lioness 's long tongue lolls down against the mouth of her cub , which is stretched up on tiptoes to meet it .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
Mr . Koo did not avoid politically sensitive issues , clearly and unambiguously giving voice to the Republic of China 's political principles . And by avoiding the mainland 's trap , Mr . Koo expanded the scope of the dialogue to include the rights of the people and lured the mainland into agreeing to four points of consensus set by Taiwan . While working within the major differences outlined above , the two sides together sought out minor points to agree upon .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
" The Marshall Islands have a severe shortage of water for industrial use , so it is not appropriate to set up fish processing operations there such as canning factories . But their geographical location makes them suitable to be developed as a Pacific base for Taiwan 's fishing industry , if they are amenable to this kind of cooperation , " says Koo Kuan-min .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
As for the imperial clubs , according to The Book of Chuiwan they were edged with pure gold , inlaid with jade , and their shafts sumptuously decorated . When their majesties had finished playing , their equipment was not put away in bags , but placed in brocaded cases . Even today 's top-flight golf clubs , which sell for NT $ 800-900,000 a set , would look pretty shabby next to kit like this .  
He also felt that nanguan had gotten into a terrible rut with hackneyed , sentimental lyrics that did not speak to the concerns of modern society . He wrote lyrics for over 200 new songs which Zhuo then set to music . Among other themes , his songs described Singaporean scenes , delivered satirical commentary on social ills , and expressed the author 's own feelings .  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
In Anhui Province there was Ouyang Xiu 's self-effacingly named Pavilion of the Drunk Old Gentleman , where the mind of the aforementioned gentleman was preoccupied with scenic wonders rather than the next drink . The settings of these retreats reflected the aesthetic ideals of the literati and their detached approach to life , and it was these same people , the educated elite , who set the tone for national and local administration during the Song dynasty .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .  
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience . " If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
A temporary outdoor stage has been set up immediately opposite an Earth God temple . The purpose of hiring a drama troupe is to thank the gods for their benevolence and supplicate them for their continued good graces , but the audience is sparse , and the performers look rather uninspired . Tea-picking opera is only performed these days at an occasional temple function . Apart from the language , probably most people in Taiwan ca n't tell the difference between tea-picking opera and the ubiquitous Taiwanese opera .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
In addition to being an important cultural center in ancient India , the Gandhara region of northwest India ( straddling the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , had also been a part of the Greek empire for a time , and was deeply influenced by Hellenic culture . In Buddhist sculpture from Gandhara , the figures have the deeply set eyes , aquiline noses , and curly hair so typical of Greek statues .  
Some paddies are full of plants rising above the water to all different heights . Others are set aside just for lotus and water lily . Bits of clouds and blue sky reflect between the plants off the broken surface of the water . Plants of every description cover the raised earthen barriers between the different paddies , their tiny maroon , yellow , and white blossoms standing out brilliantly in the sun .  
In this way , the western part of the Southeast Asian littoral came within China 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , there were great profits to be had . Each expedition set out laden with silk and porcelain , to be exchanged for rare and precious commodities from overseas , and this too helps to explain why Zheng set sail on seven separate voyages .  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
For example , Chang Ta-chun rejects the idea that My Kid Sister and Wild Child are representative of his oeuvre . These were selected for translation mainly because the themes were more comprehensible to a foreign audience . " My other works , " he explains , " are about events or are set against backdrops peculiar to China or Taiwan , and would n't be easy to translate , much less be accessible to most American readers . "  
There is nothing in the main living area save a large desk covered with black plastic matting , a TV set , and mountainous piles of long sheets of calligraphy paper . But there are other signs as well . On the wall hangs a scroll , reading " Dragon flying , phoenix dancing , " done in a flowing , dynamic hand .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
" Passage for myself and several of the students on board a junk loaded with planks was engaged from Tamsui . We set out , but the winds were contrary , and after two days of tossing and seasickness we rounded the northern point of Formosa and ran into Kim-pau-li , on the northeast . Here we got water and food , for our supply was well-nigh exhausted .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
Much to his surprise , someone showed up in the middle of the night with bolt cutters and set him free . Fully awake to the treacherous intentions of his relatives , Wang decided to head for southern China and make a life there together with Yueh-ching , the sweet and innocent daughter of a tenant farmer . The two married , and warfare continued .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
The legend says that these former slaves later slaughtered a group of British soldiers who had landed on the island to explore it . When a British naval vessel discovered the soldiers ' fate , the sailors piled brush at the mouth of the cave in which the slaves were hiding , doused it in oil , and set it alight . The fire burned for three days , killing all of the several hundred slaves inside . This sad event is the origin of the cave 's name .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
One day , acting upon the advice of his ox , the Oxherd retrieved and hid an article of celestial garb he had come upon by the riverside . The Weaving Maid , unable to return to heaven because she no longer possessed her celestial garb , agreed to marry the earnest and straightforward Oxherd . With the husband tilling the fields and the wife weaving her cloth , the couple set about raising two sons .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
In the early ' 70s , his " Mourning the Moon " serigraph series was seen as the beginning of the second phase of his career . A sometimes-strong , sometimes-soft brush style took over from the coarse lines and geometric shapes of his earlier period . The " Large Calligraphy " series , executed with an airbrush , featured a combination of fascinating colors with an agile calligraphic style . The colorful Chinese characters set against a jet-black night sky are reminiscent of the fireworks of a traditional Chinese festival .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
The team she leads took the theme of " family reunion at Mid-Autumn Festival " as the basis to ingeniously integrate content from earth science ( the movement of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon ) , maths ( quadratic functions of Hou Yi shooting down the nine suns ) , history ( mid-autumn legends and the Mongol Empire ) , and counseling activities ( satisfactions and regrets in life ) , which they linked together in a set of thematic activities with a rich content .  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
If you come into the downtown area , the National Policy Foundation and the Taiwan Research Institute , set in the middle of the concrete jungle , would , on the other hand , be more reminiscent of the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution in Washington , with large numbers of retired government officials , and therefore tight security , in their modern office buildings .  
In its traditional form , qigui has always been quite a simple matter . You go to any temple , stand facing any one of the small sacred tortoises set out on display , light three incense sticks to respectfully inform the netherworld of your choice , and then cast the divining blocks ( two matching wooden blocks shaped like the halves of a cashew nut ) .  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
" Personal e-papers cover everything . It 's hard to imagine sometimes , but there are the minimum number of subscribers for all kinds of bizarre stuff , " says Sean Fu , CEO of the Internet Research Company , Maillist 's parent firm . For example , Maillist has even attracted more than 100 web users from mainland China to set up e-papers , some of which are devoted exclusively to attacking the idea of Taiwan independence , and even these are able to maintain the basic level of a hundred or more subscribers .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
In 1972 , UNESCO , considering the damage that war , natural disasters , and industrial development have been doing to precious cultural and natural assets , adopted the " Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . " This set out rigorous and comprehensive conditions for determining what places are qualified to be deemed World Heritage sites ; it also encouraged signatories to apply to have the assets within their territories that are " of outstanding universal value " included on the World Heritage list .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen .

Among the relics from Famen Temple , which is located in Fufeng County in Shaanxi Province , is a silver censer with gilded twin bee designs set in floral circlets .

Thanks to Lukang 's early prosperity , which brought many arts and crafts masters from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China to teach in Taiwan , Lukang has always been famous throughout the island for its artisanship . In early days , when someone 's daughter was getting married , there was no more demonstrative gift than a complete set of traditional Lukang furniture inlaid with precious metals and shells .  
The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings . The seriousness with which the ritual was taken is evidenced by the fact that a central government official-Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Liu Wann-hong-served as master of ceremonies , with the Changhua County executive and the mayor of Lukang as his seconds .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .

When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area .

" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang .

" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says .

It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .

While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House .

The doctor from Singapore , speaking to them in Malaysian , 70-80% of which is similar to Indonesian , stays busy trying to keep them mollified .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .

Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year .

Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
According to Zhang , the classic forms of the wuxia , or wandering swordsman , genre of Chinese film have already been defined . There are , for example , King Hu 's gentle and even feminine Zen-flavored aesthetics ; Chang Cheh 's tough exteriors that hide gentle hearts ; and even Ang Lee 's evocation of the boldness coupled with restraint central to Chinese culture . Zhang did n't want to replicate any of these , so in Hero he set out to define a new wuxia aesthetic .

" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .

Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .

After base areas are set up at Meifeng , vegetable crops suitable for cool , high elevations can be planted by machine instead of by hand ; fruit trees too are planted in rain-sheltered systems and managed for increased yields . The wooded areas that separate cultivated fields from the original land provide staged filtration of contaminants from rainwater runoff . Meifeng 's soil management methods have proven effective enough to preserve its resources over an eight-year period that has seen numerous typhoons and the 921 earthquake .  
Farm director Chang Yu-sen explains , " We base the camps on our existing crops and cultivation areas .

The last two have stayed as large parts of local culture , but brickwork somehow fell out of favor , and so Liao set herself to reviving brickworking as a living part of the culture .  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches . Having such a major company recognise their work has encouraged Liao and Chang immensely .

Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 378,600 United States dollars gross ( 373,800 dollars net ) for the period from 16 December 1994 to 16 June 1995 ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
is evident that the continuation of this kind of irresponsible unilateral conduct and arrogant behaviour by the United States Government will set an alarming precedent with far-reaching adverse implications for international peace and security and create uncertainty and insecurity in international relations , for which the United States alone must bear full responsibility .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
Above and beyond the creation of a dense industrial network , the direct involvement of the State in economic management has made it possible for us to take on the considerable and manifold needs of a population deprived of essentials in the areas of education , health , jobs and housing and to set up an infrastructure even in the remotest corners of our vast territory .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course of national and international endeavours for sustainable development in the light of economic , social and environmental goals and in reaffirmation of the importance of obtaining new and additional resources to finance the plan of action to be adopted .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the Summit , containing an important set of commitments and recommendations to be implemented , became a historic landmark that established the international consensus on the goals to be pursued and achieved in the area of social development for the coming decades .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Certainly , the logic of evolution and the rules of transformation indicate that the stages of change carry within them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry , unless an objective and conducive environment exists , accompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of highly advanced values that are crystallized through coordinated and concerted efforts . 
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
We would have preferred that the draft resolution set down as its principal operative conclusion a firm call on the international community to consider further the fundamental and challenging questions that the advisory opinion poses .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session . 
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
The facts revealed since this aircraft began to be used , as set out in our aforementioned letters , in addition to the ill repute the aircraft has acquired following earlier spy flights over other parts of the world , require that the United Nations re-examine the issue of continued forcible use of the aircraft by the United States of America to violate Iraq 's airspace in a manner totally incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as they relate to respect for the sovereignty of all Member States .  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
Therefore , paragraph 4 of the draft resolution stated that the General Assembly noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of indebtedness , stressed that non-payment of undisputed debts reflected badly on the entire diplomatic community , reaffirmed that non-compliance with contractual obligations could not be justified or condoned , and endorsed the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
One of the purposes of the Central American Integration System , as set forth in the Tegucigalpa Protocol , is to attain the sustainable development of Central America , which presupposes defining a new , unique , comprehensive and indivisible regional security model inspired by the region 's achievements during its intensive process of pacification and integration ;  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
His delegation rejected the draft resolution , particularly the provisions concerning the deployment of human rights monitors throughout Iraqi territory , since those provisions violated the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and might set an alarming precedent for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
It is particularly difficult to apply meaningfully when the respondent is asked to express a value for many functions of the forest that have no established monetary market value , such as provision of cleaner water , which might become available in a hypothetical set of circumstances , such as through reduction in upstream harvesting activities . 
Several representatives reported that new structures had been set up to strengthen the office of the Attorney-General in their respective States to investigate and take action against criminal organizations , while others reported the adoption of measures to make judicial cooperation more flexible and transparent , particularly with regard to extradition and mutual assistance . 
It may be recalled that the General Assembly , in its decision 49 / 483 of 12 July 1995 , decided that there would be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 , inclusive .  
At its third annual session , the Subcommittee established an initial set of 12 themes , of which 5-8 would be prepared in a first round , to be completed prior to the convening of the thirty-ninth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
They reaffirmed their commitment to work cooperatively towards achieving the prime objective of the Programme of Action which is to arrest the further deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least developed countries , to reactivate and accelerate growth and development in these countries and , in the process , to set them on the path of economic growth and sustainable development based on shared responsibility and strengthened partnership .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action 1 / and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
My country welcomes the Secretary-General 's current report , which some contains very positive and encouraging elements regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti and congratulates UNMIH for the progress achieved during the fulfilment of its mandate , as set out in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) , to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a safe and stable climate , to protect international personnel and essential installations , to ensure the desired conditions for the holding of elections and to create a new professional police force .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The digital data set , which includes a complete set of electromagnetic , magnetic and spectrometric data as well as geologic and planimetric information in digital form , is a valuable tool in the search for new mineral deposits .  
Strategic alliances , however , have several qualities that set them apart from other linkages : they are long-term , they involve " tight operating linkages " , they are based on some kind of formal or tacit agreement and they are underpinned by mutual expectations of continued cooperation .  
51 The response by Australia to the threat of organized crime has developed into a comprehensive set of measures representing a " whole-system " approach , whose principal features include the creation of a specialized agency , emphasis on cooperation and coordination between the different levels of government and between law enforcement agencies , legislation targeting key aspects of organized crime , and a strategic approach to the problem , based on high-quality strategic intelligence and assessments .  
The Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , complemented by the action already taken by the Commission at its fourth session , have set in motion a process of increased awareness of the threat posed by organized transnational crime and of the need for urgent action at the national and international levels .  
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
Other representatives stated that the congresses on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders , the status of which had been modified since they had begun acting as consultative body to the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , should henceforth be better able to respond to the actual needs of Member States , but should nevertheless not fail to set precise objectives and reduce the number of resolutions adopted .  
The United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency ( The Riyadh Guidelines ) set forth standards for the protection of young persons who are abandoned , neglected , abused or in marginal circumstances , in other words , at social risk , covering the pre-conflict stage , before juveniles come into conflict with the law , having a child-centred orientation , and being based on the premise that it is necessary to offset those conditions that adversely influence and impinge on the healthy development of the child ; 
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .

The Moroccan delegation 's initiative sought to impose a singular , selective , partisan and tendentious interpretation of the reports of the Secretary-General and to accept it would have set an unfortunate and dangerous precedent .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
It is the Greek Cypriot side which rejects the set of ideas by putting forward totally unrealistic demands , alien to the negotiating process , with the professed aim of doing away with the Treaty of Guarantee as well as other fundamental elements of a realistic solution , in a transparent attempt to bring about the ultimate Greek domination of Cyprus .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .

As to the specific proposal raised by Malta ( see A / 50 / 142 ) , the question of how the United Nations machinery for dealing with international environmental issues should be developed is a very important substantive issue that needs to be addressed in the first instance by the policy machinery that the General Assembly has set up to consider coordination of environmental and development issues - the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
In Brazil , for example , the National Confederation of Health-care Cooperatives ( Unimed do Brasil ) has grown from a single cooperative set up in 1967 to a business complex now comprising 304 provider-owned health cooperatives , many owning hospitals , organized in 17 State-level networks , and a national holding company that owns subsidiaries in insurance and provides bulk purchasing and common services for members ' hospitals and clinics ; data management and communications ; and training , research and development .  
In particular , minimum guarantee capital requirements are usually set on the basis of international standards and the " top end " of the market and often exceed considerably the value of premiums underwritten by a cooperative enterprise , given that these relate to the needs of members and , although critical to large numbers of persons , are modest in aggregate .  
A number of quantitative parameters included in FAO 's periodic forest resources assessment and possible future national reports required under the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Combating Desertification and the information collected for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( CITES ) may potentially constitute such a core set .  
If two adjoining countries do not agree on a set of common rules on how goods passing through each other 's territory will be treated , then national law will prevail in each case , and a motor vehicle , for example , might be subject to multiple unnecessary inspections , might require different insurance coverage , might be subject to special license requirements , etc .

As part of the plan , which involved the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and several international non-governmental organizations , relief food and essential drugs were provided to vulnerable groups , seeds and tools were distributed to farming families , special feeding centres were set up and vaccination campaigns were conducted .  
Having regard to the requirements " within existing resources " and " in a coordinated way " set forth in paragraph 3 of resolution 50 / 51 , the Secretary-General decided to select those existing units within the Secretariat which might be in a position to best complement their respective competencies in carrying out the functions set out in paragraph 3 in an effective manner , instead of creating new and costly structures .

The attitude and statements of the United States set a grave precedent in the history of international relations and run counter to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , Article 2 , paragraph 4 , of which reads : " All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations . "

A set of agreed conclusions was adopted ( agreed conclusions 1996 / 1 ) , in which the Council stressed the important role played by the United Nations system in the overall effort for poverty eradication and in assisting Member States in translating the global goals and commitments of the international conferences and the statutory mandates of each organization into concrete actions and activities at all levels .  
In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .

The Working Group was established by the Commission in its resolution 1991 / 42 of 5 March 1991 , by which the Commission decided " to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned " . 
Because of the obstacles experienced and the serious hindrances caused by the Israeli leadership 's failure to respect its commitments , our Council must today face the logical results of such a situation and of the Israeli attitude , which differs greatly from what the international community has set down as the fundamental principles for a peaceful , comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict .  
In my view , the presence and assistance of the international community will continue to be required beyond November 1996 to help the Government of Haiti set up a professional , well - managed and well-equipped civilian police and ensure that a stable environment will be consolidated , that democracy will take root and that economic and social development will translate into a visible improvement of the living conditions of the people . 
Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
Moreover , Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot leader , Mr . Denktash , through their recent actions and most revealing intentions have not only undermined the very basis of the High-level Agreements and the agreed principles as set out in relevant United Nations resolutions , accepted even by Turkey itself , but have clearly attempted to foil or discontinue any renewed promising efforts in lifting the long-persisting impasse in the negotiating process .

In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .

The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
Within the framework of the WHO project , implemented in three stages , national specialists have been undergoing training , both abroad and in-country ; laboratories for analyses have been set up in provinces and towns ; and the necessary equipment , instruments , chemical substances and diagnostic devices for analysis have been supplied to urban and rural areas .  
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
We have however set forward these views , given our strong commitment to the achievement of a viable , effective and credible treaty which must reinforce the international nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation regime .  
Human rights are understood to be the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the third generation of human rights set forth in the Constitution , the laws and the treaties in force , together with those contained in the declarations and principles approved by the United Nations or the Organization of American States ( PDDH Act , art .  2 ) .  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The third report , devoted to the definition of reservations , covered the majority of chapter II of the provisional plan of the study set forth in the introductory chapter of the second report . 148-Two of the planned sections , Distinction between reservations and other procedures aimed at modifying the application of treaties and The legal regime of interpretive declarations , have , however , been omitted for different reasons . 
The Sub-Committee , while respecting the principles set out in article 3 , is encouraged to cooperate for the prevention of torture in general with the relevant United Nations organs and mechanisms as well as international , regional and national institutions or organizations working towards strengthening the protection of persons from torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
As to the exact way in which the notion of an accessory right might be expressed in paragraph ( 1 ) , while the concern was expressed that the second set of bracketed language might be circular , it was agreed that it was preferable , since it left the question of the accessory or independent nature of the security right to law applicable outside the draft Convention .  
A dangerous precedent has been set for the revival of the policy of imposing ones will by force , and the entire modern international legal order has been jeopardized .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Only 82 of the 185 States Members of the United Nations reported the full set of major macroeconomic aggregates in the last five years . 19 This is despite the fact that economic statistics , and in particular national accounts , are well-established statistical areas , with internationally agreed upon standards and methodologies and with a history of data collection . 
The Commission recognized that setting time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment would give a strong signal of the increased priority to be accorded to the objective of full employment . 7 In the past many countries have set targets for the intermediate goals of reduction of inflation or for the rate of economic growth but few set targets for the centrally important goal of employment growth and linked them with strategies for their achievement . 
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
That the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and access to health care , as set out in article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is an integral part of the full realization of all their human rights , which are universal , indivisible and interdependent ;  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
On the basis of the reports prepared by the technical experts and attached to the documentation , which set forth the material damage sustained by public and private installations in the two aforementioned cities ;  
In other national laws a link is required between the property to be attached and the claim in that , for example , immunity can not be pleaded in respect of funds allocated for economic or commercial activity governed by private law upon which the claim is based or that immunity can not be pleaded with respect to assets set aside by the State to pursue its commercial activities .  
Special development situations require an integrated approach to security and development , one that entails programmes set in a time-frame larger than three years and that has as an integral part , from the outset of the peace-building process , social and community development programmes designed to meet the basic needs of the population .  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
As reflected in paragraphs 12 and 13 of its eleventh report on the programme budget for the biennium 1990-1991 , 1 / the Advisory Committee agreed with the Secretary-General 's conclusion that a structural change in the level of the emoluments of the members of the Court was justified at that time and recommended that the annual salary of members of the Court be set at $ 145,000 , effective 1 January 1991 , with the next review to take place no later than three years from 1 January 1991 .  
Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;  
That the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and access to health care , as set out in article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is an integral part of the full realization of all their human rights , which are universal , indivisible and interdependent ;  
The main objective of the Model Law was to offer national legislators a set of internationally acceptable rules allowing a number of legal obstacles to be removed and a more secure legal environment created for electronic commerce .  
advertising activities on the Internet for the promotion of any form of goods or services , set standards of ethical conduct to be observed by all advertisers and marketers to increase the public 's confidence in marketing in the interactive media , to safeguard advertisers ' freedom of expression , to minimize the incentive for governmental regulation , and to meet reasonable consumer privacy expectations . 
In its resolution S-20 / 4 , entitled Measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem , the Assembly set out specific actions to be taken by Member States and by UNDCP and called for UNDCP to play a catalytic role in mobilizing international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , United Nations organizations and the private sector for work on the drug problem and for assisting interested Governments .  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
The religious leaders emphasized the peaceful co-existence of the two communities , but with the other two groups focused on the tragic events in January / February 1998 that set the stage in Bahr-el-Ghazal for the worst humanitarian crisis culminating in the deadliest famine since 1988 , when an estimated 250,000 people were killed , and in massive population displacement .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
This will provide an obvious opportunity for country teams , which so desire , to pursue several objectives at the same time lightening the burden on national officials by having fewer evaluations , concentrating on fewer and more important issues and using only one set of procedures ; increasing focus on , and understanding at the national level , of the overall contribution of the United Nations system ; economizing on scarce resources allocated for monitoring and evaluation .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
In late 1998 , the firm Veng S.A . was set up with the aim of developing new-generation space vehicles through unconventional mechanisms of financing by the private sector and scientific and technological bodies .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
A staff member , other than one recruited specifically for a mission , who has completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who has a permanent appointment and who is called upon to serve in the armed forces of the State of which the staff member is a national , whether for training or active duty , may be granted special leave without pay for the duration of such military service , in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in appendix C to these Rules .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
It had set the basis for a forward-looking organization that is flexible , innovative and proactive , able to implement policies and programmes effectively around shared goals , transparent and accountable in its dealings with donors , developing countries and people around the world , and equipped for fruitful partnerships with the rest of the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
It called upon members and associate members that have not yet done so to set up and strengthen national mechanisms on ageing , inter alia , to enable them to coordinate the observance of the International Year of Older Persons , and to set specific time-bound targets on ageing and related issues , in the light of the needs and aspirations of older persons , in keeping with indigenous traditions and their milieux .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
They agreed that strategic and policy analysis relevant to the peace-building and development objectives set out in the report would be more systematically shared among them , and directed all the Committees subsidiary bodies and other relevant inter-agency mechanisms to give special attention to ways of pursuing the objectives set in the report .  
It was the first instrument in the world to set forth a list of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations .  
From my perspective as a former President of the CD , I am inclined more and more to consider the Presidential troika mechanism as a tool in resolving complicated procedural issues , such as the establishment of a subsidiary body , as exemplified by its activities last year , and not as suitable for the conduct of regular discussions on one concrete issue and its set of closely related aspects .  
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
Without energetic implementation both at the national and the international level , however , the insight gained will not lead to the aims set ; at a minimum this includes the reduction of the number of undernourished people to half their 1996 level by 2015 .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time-frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action and those contained in the present document is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights .  6 .  The Programme of Action recommended a set of interdependent quantitative goals and objectives .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
It should be mentioned that following consultations with non-governmental organizations acting in the field of HIV / AIDS and representatives of United Nations agencies working in Romania , it was decided to set up a national multisectoral AIDS commission to examine the potential spread of AIDS and its consequences for the Romanian population and to assess the programmes developed so far with a view to working out a national strategy against this dreadful malady .  
On the basis of the Cairo Programme of Action , Benin has developed a strategy we call the common minimum social welfare programme , aimed at improving the quality of life of families and covering a set of basic needs in five essential areas : health , education , food , developing people 's ability to create wealth , and opening up communities . 
We also reaffirm that , as set forth at the Fourth World Conference on Women , we are determined to promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services .  
However , I am of the firm belief that with our strong conviction and commitment , coupled with the wide and constructive participation of all relevant actors and with the support of the international community , we will be able to achieve our common objectives , as set out in the ICPD recommendations .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
Furthermore , at a time when the economic and demographic situation is a global issue , it is important to strengthen international cooperation in this inevitable process of globalization and to exchange ideas and know-how , in the spirit of consensus-building , in order to reach the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life of present and future generations set by the ICPD .  
Achieving the multiplicity of goals set at various conferences such as Agenda 21 , the Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States and the Cairo Programme of Action is not easy , but we can fully realize that objective if the international community , international financial institutions , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and national Governments together make a firm and collaborative commitment to such a worthy undertaking .  
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
Rather , its task was ( a ) to agree on the basic elements of a workable definition of unilateral acts as a starting point for further work on the topic as well as for gathering relevant State practice , ( b ) to set the general guidelines according to which the practice of States should be gathered and ( c ) to point the direction that the work of the Special Rapporteur should take in the future .

The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
As a result of this consensus , there is now no more room for promoting one set of rights as against another , or putting forward some rights , such as economic and social , to be fulfilled prior to or in violation of civil and political rights , or vice versa .  
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
This joint session , to be attended by senior PA officials and representatives of the donor community , would aim to present a coherent set of technical assistance activities identified by the PA and to attract the interest of potential donors to UNCTAD and UNDP proposals . 
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
It provides a basic set of contractual provisions which can ensure that electronic commercial transactions may subsequently be concluded by commercial partners within a sound legal framework .  
As a Latin American , and in particular a South American , I wish to extend a fraternal greeting to the delegation of Ecuador , a country which presided over the General Assembly 's First Committee a few years ago , a co _ participant in the Tlatelolco Treaty regime , a nation which has recently set an historic example by peacefully settling a bilateral dispute within the strict observance of international law , thereby consolidating the pacific vocation of our region . 
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
The representative further stated that it would be a great misfortune for the defenders of human rights if a precedent was set whereby any non-governmental organization involved in a technical-procedural error was to be punished unduly on the basis of one specific case .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
The General Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the item also be considered directly in plenary for the sole purpose of taking action on the draft resolution entitled Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women recommended to the General Assembly for its adoption by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1999 / 13 of 28 July 1999 , on the understanding that this would not set a precedent .  
In the five months that have elapsed , many people have registered to participate , and the Government has selected 181 of them ; dates have been set and postponed ; venues have been selected and changed ; the proposed facilitators referred to earlier have visited the country ; and three committees have been established .  However , a national debate has yet to be held , and only the Organizational Committee is in operation .  
Furthermore , the Committee agreed on a detailed set of recommendations addressed to national parliaments on strengthening parliamentary input into the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session .  
By paying attention to the needs for a concerted action of the international community to address the regional dimensions of the root causes of conflict , the chapter calls for a coordinated regional approach that should be based on a set of agreed principles .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
The main functions of the Division will be to plan and monitor the economic and social reconstruction of East Timor , in close consultation with the East Timorese ; to prepare and evaluate policies and to set up institutions in the economic , social and financial fields ; and to coordinate with the various donors and international financial institutions the resource mobilization efforts of UNTAET .  
The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives , recognized as legal entities , are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises , and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
The specific commitments from developing countries and the donor community to expand basic social services called for at the international meeting on the 20 / 20 initiative held at Hanoi were essential to realizing the goals set at Beijing and Cairo .  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
Calls upon all States to translate into concrete action their commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , and urges them , inter alia , to immediately eliminate the worst forms of child labour as set out in the new International Labour Organization Convention No .  182 ;  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The General Assembly , Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein , without distinction of any kind , in particular as to race , colour or national origin ,  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Turning to the issue of human resources development , he said that ILO considered that there was an urgent need to set in place active labour market policies to help workers cope with the growing problems of job loss and redeployment .  Training and re-training programmes , job search assistance , vocational counselling and access to good labour market information were all essential .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Above all , it was vital that children and young people should be involved in the discussions and actions which sought to improve their social environment and set minimum international living standards for children .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
The wave of economic and corporate restructurings undertaken to respond to an increasingly competitive global market and the widespread dismantling of social security systems have resulted in unemployment , work insecurity and worsening labour conditions giving rise to violations of core economic and social rights set forth in articles 6 to 9 of the Covenant .  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .

The objective of the present guidelines is to provide advice to Governments and set out broad principles on which national cooperative policy might best be based , recognizing that more specific and detailed national policies fall within the responsibility of each Government .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 324,900 dollars gross ( 297,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 18 above ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 57,990,000 dollars gross ( 53,116,100 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 19 above ;  
For their part , most LDCs have pursued economic reform programmes set out in the previous Programmes of Action , including eliminating or substantially reducing tariffs and other trade barriers , liberalizing currency regimes , privatizing public enterprises , establishing and strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks and adopting liberal investment policies .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
In similar fashion , better efforts should be made to achieve improved relations between States , not only because this is mandated in the Charter , but also because it is viewed as essential to the global realization of human rights as indicated in article 28 of the Universal Declaration : quite clearly an international order that is generating terrorist acts hardly qualifies as a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in th [ e ] Declaration can be fully realized . 
The special session of the General Assembly on children was expected to produce a global agenda with a set of goals and a plan of action devoted to ensuring three essential outcomes : the best start in life for all children , good-quality basic education for all children and opportunities for all children , especially adolescents ( who fall into the age cohort of youth ) , for meaningful participation in their communities .  
These are the precise considerations that led to Russias initiative to convene a Balkan summit , with a view to the conclusion , by the States of the region and interested neighbouring countries , of a legally binding agreement that would set out mutual obligations for absolute compliance with the fundamental principles of State relations , the most important of which are the inviolability of borders , sovereign equality , respect for territorial integrity , non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the non-use of force . 
One approach , associated with Anzilotti , described the legal consequences deriving from an internationally wrongful act exclusively in terms of a binding bilateral relationship thereby established between the wrongdoing State and the injured State , in which the obligation of the former State to make reparation is set against the subjective right of the latter State to require reparation . 
The main objective of the meeting was to define minimum acceptable standards for an international system of certification of rough diamonds , consistent with the mandate set out in the United Nations General Assembly resolution 55 / 56 of 1 December 2000 .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
Even though the right to development as set out in the 1986 Declaration was reaffirmed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , several industrialized countries are now attempting to question and reformulate its content and scope , including the definition of the beneficiaries of the right .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .  
A Commission for Social and Human Development has been set up and five key elements for the development policy have been defined : to satisfy at least the minimum requirement of Mexicans with respect to food , housing and education ; to apply a measure of equity in all government policies ; to focus on the population living in extreme poverty , particularly indigenous peoples ; to promote social cohesion and community spirit ; and to protect the environment .  
In his view , the outcomes from the four expert meetings dealt with items which were both central elements of UNCTADs mandate as set out in the Bangkok Plan of Action , as well as constituting key issues on the international trade agenda and subject to intensive multilateral negotiation or review in the WTO .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Reaffirming that , as declared in article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration can be fully realized and that , as declared in article 25 , paragraph 1 , everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Based on these principles , a set of new concepts has emerged and started to take form : a new security concept which consists in mutual trust , disarmament and cooperative security ; a new type of international relationship which centres on partnership and non-alignment ; and a new model of regional cooperation in which all countries , large or small , jointly take the initiative in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation .  
It is our hope that the country concerned will work out a comprehensive and practical destruction programme as soon as possible in accordance with its obligations under the Convention , which should guarantee the safety of the local people and the environment so that the substantive destruction process can be started and the grave danger posed by the abandoned chemical weapons can be eliminated within the time frame set forth in the Convention .  
However , deregulation without accompanying measures , such as the establishment of professional bodies ( haulier associations ) to set professional standards and maintain discipline among members , could create a vacuum which could be exploited by unscrupulous operators engaging in illicit or illegal practices .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
To this end like other countries Burkina Faso has set itself the objective of general and complete disarmament under international control an objective that should be pursued using a carefully balanced approach , accompanied by consistent measures .  
Recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of youth and youth organizations at the local , national , regional and international levels in promoting and implementing the World Programme of Action and in evaluating the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation and of the need to support the activities of youth mechanisms that have been set up by youth and youth organizations , bearing in mind that young people are active agents for positive change and development in society ;  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
Our objective observation of these approaches and situations which can under no circumstances be dealt with separately from an understanding of the common framework of their causes and motives prompts us to call upon the international community to set a binding international strategy for security cooperation among all States , whose components are based on the principles of international law , the Charter , resolutions , agreements , conventions and protocols of the United Nations that do not discriminate between States and peoples .  
The public expenditure level set under the national budget must ensure that the social and economic sectors are adequately financed , taking into account the absorptive and fiscal capacity of the economy over the medium term .  
The European Union also wished to stress that the victims of HIV / AIDS should receive adequate social protection ; that minimum standards should be set for social protection tailored to individual countries ; and that it unreservedly supported the Secretary-Generals Global Compact as an instrument for promoting the responsibility of the private sector for social development and social protection .  
The EU had undertaken to modernize the European social model in order to create a dynamic Union of active social States and had set itself the objectives of improving the quality of employment promoting social inclusion , encouraging participation of the social partners in managing change , ensuring the responsibility of enterprises and designing social-protection systems , including reliable retirement schemes .  
The new format , which was intended to reflect an approach that was more qualitative than quantitative , set forth the objectives around which each programme had been designed , as well as expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and external factors that could affect the level of success in meeting those expectations .  
The ambitious agenda set forth in the Declaration could not be implemented without highly qualified , productive staff working in an efficient , well-coordinated Organization capable of providing quality services at the lowest cost and dispensing with obsolete or redundant activities .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance , if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that persons race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that persons position for any of these reasons .  
The events of 11 September and the angry or opportunistic reactions that followed them , including the brutal aggression against Afghanistan based on a suspicion and the accompanying innuendos and statements emanating from the media or from officials , both American and non-American , have shown that the entire world could be set ablaze by a spark from the West , even one coming from beyond the Atlantic .  
After surveying Member States to determine the order of priority in which they would classify the various recommendations in the Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development adopted by UNISPACE III , the Committee had decided to set up 11 open-ended action teams corresponding to recommendations in priority areas that included disaster management , environmental monitoring strategy , management of Earths resources , promotion of sustainable development , space-based navigation and positioning systems , capacity-building and increasing public awareness of the importance of space activities . 
Recalling that international law set strict limits on the use of outer space for military purposes , she said that the issue of ways and means of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be studied in depth by all the bodies concerned within the context of their respective mandates . 
In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
As a consequence , the plague of hijackings of aircraft in mid-flight soon spread to the United States itself , where , for the most varied reasons , a number of people , most of them unbalanced individuals , adventurers or common criminals , from both the United States and Latin America , began to hijack aircraft , armed with firearms , knives , Molotov cocktails and sometimes just bottles of water made to look as though they contained gasoline , with which they threatened to set the aircraft on fire .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Recognizing that , while it is the primary responsibility of States to attain economic and social development and to achieve the development and poverty eradication goals as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , the international community should support the efforts of the developing countries to eradicate poverty and ensure basic social protection and to promote an enabling international environment ,  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
Recognizing that , while it is the primary responsibility of States to attain economic and social development and to achieve the development and poverty eradication goals as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , the international community should support the efforts of the developing countries to eradicate poverty and ensure basic social protection and to promote an enabling international environment ,

To promote the reinforcement of open public and private institutions and clearly defined standards that will help all individual and collective actors to forge their own development process and strengthen institutional links among economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population , as set forth in Agenda 21 , through national sustainable development councils .  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
In the light of the foregoing , we call upon you to intervene on the basis of the facts set forth above and to urge Kuwait to halt its unilateral exploitation of the shared transboundary oilfields , which causes the constant migration of our oil resources , and to reach agreement with Iraq on the manner in which these fields can be exploited so as to safeguard the rights of both parties .  
With respect to the claim of the Egyptian postal authority , the Panel recalls the conclusion in its previous report that the requirements of paragraph 11 were satisfied by telecommunication claimants who had established a regular course of dealing with Iraq and Kuwait under bilateral agreements that set forth basic obligations . 
The claimant has also demonstrated a well-founded expectation of further business dealings with Iraq under ascertainable terms which were set out , notably , in the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention and in the quarterly billing statements exchanged between the parties , and that a consistent level of profits had been realized from these dealings .  
With regard to trade and environment , the World Trade Organization has agreed to negotiations on the relationship between existing World Trade Organization rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , 13 procedures for regular information exchange between MEA secretariats and the relevant World Trade Organization committees , and the reduction or , as appropriate , elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services .  
In addition to the criteria set out above , the expert groups were required to take specific account of the indicators contained in the main existing sets of high-level indicators , unless there was an overriding technical reason for recommending an alternative .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .  
Globalization and its consequences , which may limit the possibility of achieving sustainable development in the Arab region , and the need to set up the Arab region in line with its own economic and institutional conditions and create a strong Arab regional bloc based on the regions cultural , civilizational and economic constituents ;  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
The adjustment procedure should only commence after an Annex I Party has had opportunities to correct a problem and if the expert review team finds that an Annex I Party has not adequately corrected the problem through the provision of an acceptable revised estimate , in accordance with the time-frames set out in paragraphs 64 to 69 above ; The expert review team shall officially notify the Annex I Party concerned of the calculated adjustment within the time-frame set out in these guidelines .  
When ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , to raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment of persons into their national armed forces from that set out in article 38 , paragraph 3 , of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , bearing in mind that under the Convention persons under 18 years of age are entitled to special protection , and to adopt safeguards to ensure that such recruitment is not forced or coerced ;  
When ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , to raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment of persons into their national armed forces from that set out in article 38 , paragraph 3 , of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , bearing in mind that under the Convention persons under 18 years of age are entitled to special protection , and to adopt safeguards to ensure that such recruitment is not forced or coerced ;  
Assisting LDCs to set up effective health infrastructures and to increase access to necessary medicines and vaccines , including urging the pharmaceutical industry to make drugs related to communicable diseases , particularly HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , more widely available and affordable , particularly for the LDCs , while reaffirming the need for strict compliance with safety and quality assurance and other relevant laws and regulations ;  
The adjustment procedure should only commence after the Party has had opportunities to correct a problem and if the expert review team finds that the Party has not adequately corrected the problem through the provision of an acceptable revised estimate , in accordance with the time-frames set out in paragraphs 60 to 65 above ; The expert review team shall officially notify the Party concerned of the calculated adjustment within the time-frame set out in these guidelines .  
Adopt national educational and training strategies which set achievable targets for raising participation levels among young people and which make a strong commitment to adequate and sustained investment in human resource development .  
Contribute to the development of small and medium enterprises and assist Member States in the development and the implementation of effective policies , and in the establishment of a coherent set of specialized support institutions and programmes , paying special attention to rural entrepreneurship development as well as to women entrepreneurs , particularly in the poorest countries ;
