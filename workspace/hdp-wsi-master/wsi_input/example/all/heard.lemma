The central leading comrades have come to the grassroots units , directly heard grassroots cadres ' briefings and pertinently pointed out problems .  This fact fully shows their understanding , trust and loving care of grassroots cadres , shows the high degree of importance attached by the Party Central Committee to the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level , shows their firm conviction in Marxism and the strategic vision of them as party and state leaders , and shows the correctness of the policy decision made by the Party Central Committee .  
and having heard and examined five special reports - - the State Council 's report on ensuring basic living allowance for people such as laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises , report on raising peasants ' incomes and reducing their burdens , report on building of public security contingents in recent years , report on management of the cultural market , and report on preventing and tackling atmospheric pollution in Beijing Municipality .  
While he was in Hainan , Wei Jianxing went deep to rural areas and peasant households to inspect work , held meetings of discipline inspection and supervision as well as on trade union cadres , and heard reports on the work of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government .  He fully approved of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government , in the light of Hainan 's reality .  
And then he heard a heaven-shocking and earth-shaking roar .  Although he was in a hurry , he still bid farewell in a leisurely manner .  Wang Wei departed from his beloved fighter plane as if a meteor painted a magnificent rainbow between the ocean and sky with his last light .  
Li Donghai pointed out that in the past year the Taiwan authorities refusing to acknowledge the one China principle and sparing no efforts to deny the " 1992 consensus " reached by the two associations has led to a worsening and deterioration of cross-strait relations , and has also led to Taiwan being in a constant state of chaos .  The political and economic crises have worsened , the unemployment rate has unceasingly climbed upward , and complaints are heard everywhere from the majority of the public .  
Young missile experts toil hard at places ranging from the missile launch site where thundering roars are heard to the " underground palace " where " thunder " and " electricity " are stored , and from the silent and mysterious laboratories to lecture halls that light the torch of science and technology .  
He held informal discussion meetings in Changsha , Xiangtan , and other localities , at which he heard reports on the work of the standing committees of the Hunan provincial people 's congress and people 's congresses of local cities , and extensively exchanged views with deputies to people 's congresses at various levels , as well as with leading comrades of Hunan and local cities and counties .  He also inspected some districts and units .  
It was a hot , foggy morning not long ago at a certain place in the Central Plains .  Suddenly intense artillery and small arms fire were heard , warplanes were flying over in formation , and an airborne signal unit with various communications equipment was making a landing there .  
The above views were heard by this reporter at a training site in mid-August , where a unit of a certain armored regiment of the Jinan Military Region had just completed a tactical confrontation exercise , when two " adversaries " involved in the exercise , namely , a " red unit " and a " blue unit , " began exposing each other 's loopholes in an effort to raise training quality .  
We have of late paid a visit to a certain air strike division of the Chinese Air Force , a hero unit known far and wide for its military prowess in the southeast , and interviewed the division 's Commander Zhang and political Commissar Su . What we saw and heard there has left us such a deep impression that the " fist " flight division has all along remained as a vanguard .

Having heard the cases related to the above three Burmese criminals and criminal Yan Zai , the Kunming city Intermediate People 's Court confirmed their crimes and acquired real and sufficient evidence .  The court maintained that their criminal activities had all violated the Criminal Law of the State , constituted crimes , and seriously produced great sabotage to society .  
Beginning at the end of last month [ June 2000 ] the investigation team announced " two fixes " ( confession at a fixed time and place ) , or isolated examination of Cangzhou municipal Party committee secretary Bo Shaoquan , provincial Communications Department vice chief Zhang Jian , and provincial State Administration of Taxation bureau chief Li Zhen . The Central Discipline Committee heard " two fixes " confession of standing deputy governor of Hebei Cong Fukui at the end of last month .  
The article pointed out : Since Taiwan 's " premier " has been changed recently , the political situation of the island has been shaky and unstable .  The stock market has slumped , grumbling by the people is heard everywhere , and voices of condemning the leadership of the Taiwan authorities and the Democratic Progressive Party are lingering on incessantly .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
The people 's courts have carefully heard criminal cases of organizing and using the " Falungong " cult to sabotage the implementation of laws , cause deaths , gather crowds to disrupt social order , print illegal publications , conduct and spread cult propaganda , and so on , in strict accordance with the criminal law and applicable judicial interpretations .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .  
he heard briefings by leading comrades of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , the Xinjiang Production and construction Corps , and Shaanxi Province on implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region as well as views and suggestions made by them on army units ' support of such development .  He inspected a number of key projects built with aid provided by units of armed forces .  He also took part in voluntary tree planting and met with leading cadres at or above the division level from units stationed in Xinjiang and Shaanxi .  
The existing 60 VIRs , all of which have become operational , are located at different bureaux , regional crime units and most major divisional stations for interviewing persons involved in cases which are likely to be heard in the District Court or the Court of First Instance .  
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .  
The Court heard that Customs officers of the Man Kam To Control Point stopped and searched an in-bound container truck on October 13 , 1999 and two incoming lorries on October 18 and December 29 , 1999 respectively .  The officers found a total of 33,081 pieces of assorted garments bearing false origin labels and 16,100 pieces of assorted garments bearing forged trade marks from the three vehicles .  
At about 11.30 am , a worker of a secondary school on Pak Wo Road , Sheung Shui , discovered that a seat bowl inside a male student toilet in the school was broken after she heard a loud sound there .  Smoke was seen emitting from the bowl .  
Where , in accordance with the Bill of Rights Ordinance , an appellant is entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , it is accepted that such appeals should not be heard by ExCo .  
The court heard that after extensive investigations , the man , who was identified to be an active member of a counterfeit credit card syndicate , has been making fake credit card inside an abandoned vehicle .  
Giving up on the prospect , he went home , put it in his dresser , and went out for the evening . Later that night , Ch'en heard on the radio that the grand prizewinning number was the same as that on the section of tickets which he was unable to sell . He rushed home , but only to realize that his wife had already sold the remaining ticket earlier in the evening . Every term , one winning number is chosen .  
Lu reports that one day in the late nineteenth century , a chef for an official family heard his employer singing the praises of a great dish he had just eaten , an exquisite meal of duck and chicken baked in a wine jug . The first efforts at imitation were less than ideal , so the official took the cook to the original house to learn it straight from the wife who had prepared the dinner . Later , when the chef started his own restaurant , he kept adding to and improving the recipe .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
Lee Huei-fan , an engineering student who lives in New College , had this experience : walking over the Bridge of Sighs ; along an ancient , silent , narrow alley ; opening an imposing carved wooden door ; and entering a quadrangle of flowered greenery , surrounded by solemn and classically beautiful halls ; everywhere could be heard the sounds of songs and music ; students , instructors , administrators , all sharing meals together . . . it is like a warm family garden .  
It 's almost as if golden linings had already been woven within the gray , and as soon as they are turned over , a myriad of golden rays will shoot forth . The birds have n't fully awakened yet ; only an occasional few short hoarse chirps are heard as they awaken from a night of dreaming in the treetops before they turn over and go back to sleep .  
The sound of the waking clappers is actually very low , which the ordinary people generally can not hear as they sleep . The monks are tranquil and quiet in body and mind ; to them , even a falling twig can be heard , not to mention the clappers .  
Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
At the time , Cantonese could be heard everywhere in Mexicali and checks written out in Chinese Characters were accepted as legal tender . Neat rows of social halls , temples and other Chinese organizations sprung up throughout the bustling city . Every evening in the tea houses and Chinese theaters you could hear the beating of Chinese drums and the rasping of Chinese fiddles .  
By myself now at the mountain 's heart , I sat quietly , feeling my pulse gradually slow until it faded into inaudibility . A susurrant mountain breeze sprang up to accompany the insects I heard chirping from their hiding places underneath the soil and in the trees . I wondered if there were any birds or beasts concealed in the branches or behind the trunks of the surrounding trees , spying upon me , a stranger in these parts . Occasionally , the forest 's disparate noises seemed to coalesce into a mournful yet sumptuous symphony .  
When the 27,000 residents of Shuili Rural Township heard that the Chichi line would be dismantled as soon as their fleet new highway was finished , they launched a mass petition drive and formed the Chichi Line Preservation Committee , pooling local tourist resources and holding special activities to attract outside visitors .  
Equally ill at ease , the Inner Mongolian Cultural Travel Service prepared to receive them . Never before had they guided a group so far afield . They had also heard that people from Taiwan were auther unruly ; many were pretentious and arrogant and nasty . . . Chinese from both sides of the Strait were eyeing each other , a little grudgingly .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
It is called " Warm and lustrous , with a vibration heard far away , breakable but not bent , with a sharpness that does not hurt , like a fine gentleman . " It is endowed with rich connotations and emotions .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
Stories from those days record that those Chinese laborers who risked their very lives to work overseas never failed to mail the money they accumulated back home , to improve the lives of their family . When they had the rare opportunity to return and reunite with their families , inevitably they brought some exotic curiosities , as well as tales of what they had seen and heard in the colorful world abroad , bringing smiles to the faces of loved ones .  
At that moment the sound of weeping again drifted across from the dune , and she recognized her lover 's voice . Giving a loud cry of " Dune Boy , " Crescent Moon fell into a faint inside the palanquin . The bearers heard her cry , turned round to look , and shouted in surprise , " The bride 's fainted ! "  
When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
Developing countries can not be expected to have the depth of accumulated research of say , the data going back 100 years on average for every trout and salmon species in Europe and America , or one rare British species of lycaenid butterfly which has been researched for thirty or forty years , or researchers in the mold of the British entomologist R.H.L . Disney , who has spent 25 years completing over 100 papers about " scuttle flies , " which most people have never even heard of .  
For example , every time he heard tell of a construction project going on within the range of the ruins , Tacheng Middle School teacher Chien Shih-lang would grab a metal screen and head for the dirt pile to " search for treasure , " sifting out from the dirt pile shards of stone coffin and other objects stirred up by the backhoes and arranging them in separate bags . He saved them , both as a record of local history and also as classroom material of local interest .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
Returning from distant travels , neither happy faces nor passionate embraces welcomed him . A lonely figure in front of a ramshackle house , he heard sobbing from inside . He bounded through the door to discover his youngest son lying dead on the bare planks of the wooden bed . Grouped around the small corpse were the rest of his family-as thin as rails , dressed in rags , hungrier even than his dead son .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Three years ago , Wu San-ho , an associate professor at National Taiwan University 's Department of Agriculture , heard of Chuang Yu-long 's ability to grow gorgeous , healthy crops on red clay without the use of chemical fertilizers . He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
" When relatives first heard that we were moving into a retirement community , they thought it was a sad and disgraceful affair , and even blamed my children for being unfilial , " Mrs . Lee recalls with a smile . When relatives later came to visit and saw the orderly rows of two-story condos , with carefree seniors enjoying the beautifully landscaped grounds and recreational facilities , their commiseration turned to envy .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Lie-chi likes to recall the time a music troupe came all the way from southern Taiwan with a large gong that needed tuning . Lin Wu tapped it a few times , sized up the problem , and with one sharp whack of his wooden mallet announced that the gong was fixed . The visitors were deeply disappointed at Lin s seemingly cavalier attitude , but when they struck the gong and heard the results , the elated musicians could n't stop marveling at Lin 's uncanny skill .  
In the last few years , Buddhist music-in various guises ranging from traditional chanting to folk , rock and dance music-has made itself heard in every corner of Taiwan life . There is now even a Religious Music category at the annual Golden Melody Awards . But concern has been expressed that as Buddhist music extends its creative scope , the form is failing in its essential function of promoting salvation .  
In contrast to the solemn chanting heard in temples and monasteries , this new melodic , orchestral form made for good background music at places of worship , where it enhanced the atmosphere of devotion . It also found favor with ordinary believers , who could play it at home while cooking , eating and doing their chores , confident that Buddha would n't be offended .  
Scripture includes an account of Buddha telling a nearby monk to stop reciting his texts in a singsong fashion . Sutras had to be intoned , not sung , and there was none of the melodic , rhythmic type of incantation that is heard in temples today . Members of the clergy were not allowed to take part in the music that worshippers presented by way of devotional offering , and the religious code prohibited monks and nuns from watching musical performances .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
Wang admitted to military investigators during initial questioning that six months earlier , acting alone , he had lowered himself down from the rooftop into his neighbors ' apartment looking for money . When Wu Ming-han heard noises and woke up , Wang panicked and hacked both Wu and his wife to death with a meat cleaver . Wang then stole NT $ 6,000 before returning to his own apartment .  
In little Taiwan , jam packed with its own media , not many people have heard of Arthur Liu , a man from Taiwan now living in the US who owns 30 radio stations . But when his name comes up in US television and radio circles , people are certainly impressed , and there are many legends surrounding the recent entrepreneurial rise of this media veteran .  
In this crucial period of a strategic realignment of global political and economic forces , Taiwan needs to increase its opportunities for international exposure and actively participate in international activities , in order to make its voice heard . Only in this way can Taiwan truly manifest its national status and dignity .  
Final verdict comes guilty / Which officially directed me / To cell 1st F , 39-B / Shared with an inmate / My helpless ward indeed / That often receives a visit even in my time of sleep / In my lonely cell , it 's lifeless undeniably / Language unspoken , no phones from family / Privacy invaded / Sound of silence is what was heard / Depression , anxiety and fears made my life disappear at an alarming rate . ( tr . by Lorna Kung )  
Mr . Lin , a writer who generally speaking is not averse to tuina massage , once went to a TCM traumatology clinic near his home for some skeletal manipulation . The hundred-square-meter clinic was packed full of patients , and in the middle were three reclining chairs attended a young tuina masseur . The masseur worked on Lin 's neck and back and rotated his shoulders and arms for 20 minutes . Lin heard the sound of his own joints cracking , and felt that his muscles had relaxed quite a lot .  
Many of these visitors were afflicted by chronic diseases , and seemed like someone adrift in the ocean who suddenly feels a glimmer of fresh hope on catching sight of a piece of driftwood to cling on to . Other people too , when they heard there was a way to stay healthy without injections or medicines , were eager to come and give it a try .  
In the days before physiotherapy was generally accepted , it was very normal for people to seek out a " bonesetter " or tuina therapist in Chinese martial arts studios . He believes that many bonesetters are skilled , but he has also heard stories of people being injured in such treatment , and there is too large a gray area in popular tuina .  
Gao Xingjian did not want dancing bodies , or formulaic performance , so Lin had to develop an entirely new body language . This body language often uses the vocabulary of imagery , and she could be heard telling performers : " Your body has to be like a cloud floating by . " " You 're a person walking in a crowded night market . " " It 's as if you 're desperate to shake off a snake that has wound itself around you . "  
In 2001 , Natural Beauty commissioned a communications company to conduct a survey in which they discovered that 87% of those polled in Shanghai reported having heard of Natural Beauty . An additional 81% identified Natural Beauty as a Chinese brand of cosmetics , and 92% agreed that Natural Beauty products suited Asian women .  
Early one morning when she was seven years old , and in her first year of elementary school , just as she was all set for school , she suddenly heard a wretched cry , and saw one of the family 's dogs come flying over the fence . She and her father hurried over to investigate , and found their dog Hsiao-huang lying on the ground gasping for breath , eyes wide open and staring , with blood trickling from his mouth .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
Pai first heard Mei Lanfang perform the " Walking in the Garden , Waking from a Dream " episode of The Peony Pavilion in Shanghai when he was ten years old . Though he did n't really understand it , the lines , " Once the violet and vermilion blossoms ran riot round the broken walls and through the ruined wells ; What has happened to the glorious times and beautiful scenes , in whose courtyards are pleasures and entertainments now to be found ? " etched themselves into deep into his brain .  
Seeing the industry on the decline hurt him deeply , and when he heard about the Cultural Association 's plan to try and revive it , he leapt straight in , despite not quite getting the idea himself . After reflecting on the current situation-all his children and grandchildren had moved elsewhere to work in other industries , so there would be no-one to carry on the tradition-he decided to devote himself to trying to help rebuild the old farms and give them a second shot at life .  
If the cries of the maimed and killed , their families and friends could be heard , they would demand effective action from responsible and complacent Governments , callous people and the indifferent military .  
Over the years this call , addressed to a world undergoing continuous and rapid change , has not ceased to be heard , even if the voice has sometimes been muted by political and economic circumstances , by wars and calamities , by social movements , and by walls destroyed or raised .  
My delegation has on numerous occasions called for an end to the embargo that has crippled the Cuban economy and , as members heard from the Secretary of the Council of Ministers of Cuba , cruelly endangered the lives of many innocent people , including children , the sick and the elderly , who have had to bear the brunt of untold suffering .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
It had been pointed out in its biennial report for 19961997 that if the Programmes voice was to be loud enough to be heard above the clamour of unfettered economic growth and globalization it would need adequate , stable and predictable funding .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
The Council heard a comprehensive report presented by President Yasser Arafat , in which he discussed all aspects of the political situation and the principal tasks to be accomplished in the Palestinian arena , foremost among which is the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital .  
The hearing shall be attended by a judicial authority of the requested State , assisted by an interpreter where necessary , who shall also be responsible for ensuring both identification of the individual to be heard and compliance with the fundamental principles of the law of the requested State .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this situation , combined with peer pressure and misconceived collegial loyalty , may work to the detriment of civilian victims and their families and seriously circumscribe their opportunities to have their cases heard before a competent , independent and impartial tribunal , as provided for in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary .  
The voting results on this counter-draft resolution and on the original Russian-United States bilateral nuclear arms negotiation that it is designed to belittle will have far more impact on my Government ' s attitude towards the concept of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to nuclear disarmament than will all the rhetoric that we have heard alleging genuine desire in the international community to seek progress towards nuclear disarmament .  
It is a vexing and tragic mosaic of suffering , and its seemingly endless civil war exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation , as we heard in the briefing this morning .  
Not once in this entire sevenyear debate on Security Council reform have we heard any major State declare that it deserves permanent membership because it is willing to give a solemn commitment to put global interests ahead of national interests .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
They heard each member of the Council make comments and ask relevant and specific questions of the President of Rwanda , namely concerning the presence of forces of aggression on the Congolese territory , the permeability of common borders and the need to build a free , secure and democratic Rwandan society based on human rights , equality and respect for diversity .  
UNIFEM believed that it was critical for women to take part in shaping the policies and practices that governed national , regional and global agreements in such areas as social responsibility of corporations , new trade agreements , reconstruction of societies emerging from war , or actions to respond to the scourge of HIV / AIDS . Womens voices and priorities must be heard .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
At its 25th meeting , on 15 August 2001 , the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , having considered the final working paper submitted by the Special Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene A . Daes , on indigenous peoples and their relationship to land ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 2001 / 21 ) , having heard the significant and constructive statement by the Special Rapporteur and expressing deepest appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent , valuable final working paper , decided :  
The central leading comrades have come to the grassroots units , directly heard grassroots cadres ' briefings and pertinently pointed out problems .  This fact fully shows their understanding , trust and loving care of grassroots cadres , shows the high degree of importance attached by the Party Central Committee to the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level , shows their firm conviction in Marxism and the strategic vision of them as party and state leaders , and shows the correctness of the policy decision made by the Party Central Committee .  
and having heard and examined five special reports - - the State Council 's report on ensuring basic living allowance for people such as laid-off workers of state-owned enterprises , report on raising peasants ' incomes and reducing their burdens , report on building of public security contingents in recent years , report on management of the cultural market , and report on preventing and tackling atmospheric pollution in Beijing Municipality .  
While he was in Hainan , Wei Jianxing went deep to rural areas and peasant households to inspect work , held meetings of discipline inspection and supervision as well as on trade union cadres , and heard reports on the work of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government .  He fully approved of the Hainan provincial CPC committee and government , in the light of Hainan 's reality .  
And then he heard a heaven-shocking and earth-shaking roar .  Although he was in a hurry , he still bid farewell in a leisurely manner .  Wang Wei departed from his beloved fighter plane as if a meteor painted a magnificent rainbow between the ocean and sky with his last light .  
Li Donghai pointed out that in the past year the Taiwan authorities refusing to acknowledge the one China principle and sparing no efforts to deny the " 1992 consensus " reached by the two associations has led to a worsening and deterioration of cross-strait relations , and has also led to Taiwan being in a constant state of chaos .  The political and economic crises have worsened , the unemployment rate has unceasingly climbed upward , and complaints are heard everywhere from the majority of the public .  
Young missile experts toil hard at places ranging from the missile launch site where thundering roars are heard to the " underground palace " where " thunder " and " electricity " are stored , and from the silent and mysterious laboratories to lecture halls that light the torch of science and technology .  
He held informal discussion meetings in Changsha , Xiangtan , and other localities , at which he heard reports on the work of the standing committees of the Hunan provincial people 's congress and people 's congresses of local cities , and extensively exchanged views with deputies to people 's congresses at various levels , as well as with leading comrades of Hunan and local cities and counties .  He also inspected some districts and units .  
It was a hot , foggy morning not long ago at a certain place in the Central Plains .  Suddenly intense artillery and small arms fire were heard , warplanes were flying over in formation , and an airborne signal unit with various communications equipment was making a landing there .  
The above views were heard by this reporter at a training site in mid-August , where a unit of a certain armored regiment of the Jinan Military Region had just completed a tactical confrontation exercise , when two " adversaries " involved in the exercise , namely , a " red unit " and a " blue unit , " began exposing each other 's loopholes in an effort to raise training quality .  
We have of late paid a visit to a certain air strike division of the Chinese Air Force , a hero unit known far and wide for its military prowess in the southeast , and interviewed the division 's Commander Zhang and political Commissar Su . What we saw and heard there has left us such a deep impression that the " fist " flight division has all along remained as a vanguard .

Having heard the cases related to the above three Burmese criminals and criminal Yan Zai , the Kunming city Intermediate People 's Court confirmed their crimes and acquired real and sufficient evidence .  The court maintained that their criminal activities had all violated the Criminal Law of the State , constituted crimes , and seriously produced great sabotage to society .  
Beginning at the end of last month [ June 2000 ] the investigation team announced " two fixes " ( confession at a fixed time and place ) , or isolated examination of Cangzhou municipal Party committee secretary Bo Shaoquan , provincial Communications Department vice chief Zhang Jian , and provincial State Administration of Taxation bureau chief Li Zhen . The Central Discipline Committee heard " two fixes " confession of standing deputy governor of Hebei Cong Fukui at the end of last month .  
The article pointed out : Since Taiwan 's " premier " has been changed recently , the political situation of the island has been shaky and unstable .  The stock market has slumped , grumbling by the people is heard everywhere , and voices of condemning the leadership of the Taiwan authorities and the Democratic Progressive Party are lingering on incessantly .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
The people 's courts have carefully heard criminal cases of organizing and using the " Falungong " cult to sabotage the implementation of laws , cause deaths , gather crowds to disrupt social order , print illegal publications , conduct and spread cult propaganda , and so on , in strict accordance with the criminal law and applicable judicial interpretations .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .  
he heard briefings by leading comrades of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , the Xinjiang Production and construction Corps , and Shaanxi Province on implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region as well as views and suggestions made by them on army units ' support of such development .  He inspected a number of key projects built with aid provided by units of armed forces .  He also took part in voluntary tree planting and met with leading cadres at or above the division level from units stationed in Xinjiang and Shaanxi .  
The existing 60 VIRs , all of which have become operational , are located at different bureaux , regional crime units and most major divisional stations for interviewing persons involved in cases which are likely to be heard in the District Court or the Court of First Instance .  
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .  
The Court heard that Customs officers of the Man Kam To Control Point stopped and searched an in-bound container truck on October 13 , 1999 and two incoming lorries on October 18 and December 29 , 1999 respectively .  The officers found a total of 33,081 pieces of assorted garments bearing false origin labels and 16,100 pieces of assorted garments bearing forged trade marks from the three vehicles .  
At about 11.30 am , a worker of a secondary school on Pak Wo Road , Sheung Shui , discovered that a seat bowl inside a male student toilet in the school was broken after she heard a loud sound there .  Smoke was seen emitting from the bowl .  
Where , in accordance with the Bill of Rights Ordinance , an appellant is entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , it is accepted that such appeals should not be heard by ExCo .  
The court heard that after extensive investigations , the man , who was identified to be an active member of a counterfeit credit card syndicate , has been making fake credit card inside an abandoned vehicle .  
Giving up on the prospect , he went home , put it in his dresser , and went out for the evening . Later that night , Ch'en heard on the radio that the grand prizewinning number was the same as that on the section of tickets which he was unable to sell . He rushed home , but only to realize that his wife had already sold the remaining ticket earlier in the evening . Every term , one winning number is chosen .  
Lu reports that one day in the late nineteenth century , a chef for an official family heard his employer singing the praises of a great dish he had just eaten , an exquisite meal of duck and chicken baked in a wine jug . The first efforts at imitation were less than ideal , so the official took the cook to the original house to learn it straight from the wife who had prepared the dinner . Later , when the chef started his own restaurant , he kept adding to and improving the recipe .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
Lee Huei-fan , an engineering student who lives in New College , had this experience : walking over the Bridge of Sighs ; along an ancient , silent , narrow alley ; opening an imposing carved wooden door ; and entering a quadrangle of flowered greenery , surrounded by solemn and classically beautiful halls ; everywhere could be heard the sounds of songs and music ; students , instructors , administrators , all sharing meals together . . . it is like a warm family garden .  
It 's almost as if golden linings had already been woven within the gray , and as soon as they are turned over , a myriad of golden rays will shoot forth . The birds have n't fully awakened yet ; only an occasional few short hoarse chirps are heard as they awaken from a night of dreaming in the treetops before they turn over and go back to sleep .  
The sound of the waking clappers is actually very low , which the ordinary people generally can not hear as they sleep . The monks are tranquil and quiet in body and mind ; to them , even a falling twig can be heard , not to mention the clappers .  
Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
At the time , Cantonese could be heard everywhere in Mexicali and checks written out in Chinese Characters were accepted as legal tender . Neat rows of social halls , temples and other Chinese organizations sprung up throughout the bustling city . Every evening in the tea houses and Chinese theaters you could hear the beating of Chinese drums and the rasping of Chinese fiddles .  
By myself now at the mountain 's heart , I sat quietly , feeling my pulse gradually slow until it faded into inaudibility . A susurrant mountain breeze sprang up to accompany the insects I heard chirping from their hiding places underneath the soil and in the trees . I wondered if there were any birds or beasts concealed in the branches or behind the trunks of the surrounding trees , spying upon me , a stranger in these parts . Occasionally , the forest 's disparate noises seemed to coalesce into a mournful yet sumptuous symphony .  
When the 27,000 residents of Shuili Rural Township heard that the Chichi line would be dismantled as soon as their fleet new highway was finished , they launched a mass petition drive and formed the Chichi Line Preservation Committee , pooling local tourist resources and holding special activities to attract outside visitors .  
Equally ill at ease , the Inner Mongolian Cultural Travel Service prepared to receive them . Never before had they guided a group so far afield . They had also heard that people from Taiwan were auther unruly ; many were pretentious and arrogant and nasty . . . Chinese from both sides of the Strait were eyeing each other , a little grudgingly .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
It is called " Warm and lustrous , with a vibration heard far away , breakable but not bent , with a sharpness that does not hurt , like a fine gentleman . " It is endowed with rich connotations and emotions .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
Stories from those days record that those Chinese laborers who risked their very lives to work overseas never failed to mail the money they accumulated back home , to improve the lives of their family . When they had the rare opportunity to return and reunite with their families , inevitably they brought some exotic curiosities , as well as tales of what they had seen and heard in the colorful world abroad , bringing smiles to the faces of loved ones .  
At that moment the sound of weeping again drifted across from the dune , and she recognized her lover 's voice . Giving a loud cry of " Dune Boy , " Crescent Moon fell into a faint inside the palanquin . The bearers heard her cry , turned round to look , and shouted in surprise , " The bride 's fainted ! "  
When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
Developing countries can not be expected to have the depth of accumulated research of say , the data going back 100 years on average for every trout and salmon species in Europe and America , or one rare British species of lycaenid butterfly which has been researched for thirty or forty years , or researchers in the mold of the British entomologist R.H.L . Disney , who has spent 25 years completing over 100 papers about " scuttle flies , " which most people have never even heard of .  
For example , every time he heard tell of a construction project going on within the range of the ruins , Tacheng Middle School teacher Chien Shih-lang would grab a metal screen and head for the dirt pile to " search for treasure , " sifting out from the dirt pile shards of stone coffin and other objects stirred up by the backhoes and arranging them in separate bags . He saved them , both as a record of local history and also as classroom material of local interest .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
Returning from distant travels , neither happy faces nor passionate embraces welcomed him . A lonely figure in front of a ramshackle house , he heard sobbing from inside . He bounded through the door to discover his youngest son lying dead on the bare planks of the wooden bed . Grouped around the small corpse were the rest of his family-as thin as rails , dressed in rags , hungrier even than his dead son .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Three years ago , Wu San-ho , an associate professor at National Taiwan University 's Department of Agriculture , heard of Chuang Yu-long 's ability to grow gorgeous , healthy crops on red clay without the use of chemical fertilizers . He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
" When relatives first heard that we were moving into a retirement community , they thought it was a sad and disgraceful affair , and even blamed my children for being unfilial , " Mrs . Lee recalls with a smile . When relatives later came to visit and saw the orderly rows of two-story condos , with carefree seniors enjoying the beautifully landscaped grounds and recreational facilities , their commiseration turned to envy .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Lie-chi likes to recall the time a music troupe came all the way from southern Taiwan with a large gong that needed tuning . Lin Wu tapped it a few times , sized up the problem , and with one sharp whack of his wooden mallet announced that the gong was fixed . The visitors were deeply disappointed at Lin s seemingly cavalier attitude , but when they struck the gong and heard the results , the elated musicians could n't stop marveling at Lin 's uncanny skill .  
In the last few years , Buddhist music-in various guises ranging from traditional chanting to folk , rock and dance music-has made itself heard in every corner of Taiwan life . There is now even a Religious Music category at the annual Golden Melody Awards . But concern has been expressed that as Buddhist music extends its creative scope , the form is failing in its essential function of promoting salvation .  
In contrast to the solemn chanting heard in temples and monasteries , this new melodic , orchestral form made for good background music at places of worship , where it enhanced the atmosphere of devotion . It also found favor with ordinary believers , who could play it at home while cooking , eating and doing their chores , confident that Buddha would n't be offended .  
Scripture includes an account of Buddha telling a nearby monk to stop reciting his texts in a singsong fashion . Sutras had to be intoned , not sung , and there was none of the melodic , rhythmic type of incantation that is heard in temples today . Members of the clergy were not allowed to take part in the music that worshippers presented by way of devotional offering , and the religious code prohibited monks and nuns from watching musical performances .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
Wang admitted to military investigators during initial questioning that six months earlier , acting alone , he had lowered himself down from the rooftop into his neighbors ' apartment looking for money . When Wu Ming-han heard noises and woke up , Wang panicked and hacked both Wu and his wife to death with a meat cleaver . Wang then stole NT $ 6,000 before returning to his own apartment .  
In little Taiwan , jam packed with its own media , not many people have heard of Arthur Liu , a man from Taiwan now living in the US who owns 30 radio stations . But when his name comes up in US television and radio circles , people are certainly impressed , and there are many legends surrounding the recent entrepreneurial rise of this media veteran .  
In this crucial period of a strategic realignment of global political and economic forces , Taiwan needs to increase its opportunities for international exposure and actively participate in international activities , in order to make its voice heard . Only in this way can Taiwan truly manifest its national status and dignity .  
Final verdict comes guilty / Which officially directed me / To cell 1st F , 39-B / Shared with an inmate / My helpless ward indeed / That often receives a visit even in my time of sleep / In my lonely cell , it 's lifeless undeniably / Language unspoken , no phones from family / Privacy invaded / Sound of silence is what was heard / Depression , anxiety and fears made my life disappear at an alarming rate . ( tr . by Lorna Kung )  
Mr . Lin , a writer who generally speaking is not averse to tuina massage , once went to a TCM traumatology clinic near his home for some skeletal manipulation . The hundred-square-meter clinic was packed full of patients , and in the middle were three reclining chairs attended a young tuina masseur . The masseur worked on Lin 's neck and back and rotated his shoulders and arms for 20 minutes . Lin heard the sound of his own joints cracking , and felt that his muscles had relaxed quite a lot .  
Many of these visitors were afflicted by chronic diseases , and seemed like someone adrift in the ocean who suddenly feels a glimmer of fresh hope on catching sight of a piece of driftwood to cling on to . Other people too , when they heard there was a way to stay healthy without injections or medicines , were eager to come and give it a try .  
In the days before physiotherapy was generally accepted , it was very normal for people to seek out a " bonesetter " or tuina therapist in Chinese martial arts studios . He believes that many bonesetters are skilled , but he has also heard stories of people being injured in such treatment , and there is too large a gray area in popular tuina .  
Gao Xingjian did not want dancing bodies , or formulaic performance , so Lin had to develop an entirely new body language . This body language often uses the vocabulary of imagery , and she could be heard telling performers : " Your body has to be like a cloud floating by . " " You 're a person walking in a crowded night market . " " It 's as if you 're desperate to shake off a snake that has wound itself around you . "  
In 2001 , Natural Beauty commissioned a communications company to conduct a survey in which they discovered that 87% of those polled in Shanghai reported having heard of Natural Beauty . An additional 81% identified Natural Beauty as a Chinese brand of cosmetics , and 92% agreed that Natural Beauty products suited Asian women .  
Early one morning when she was seven years old , and in her first year of elementary school , just as she was all set for school , she suddenly heard a wretched cry , and saw one of the family 's dogs come flying over the fence . She and her father hurried over to investigate , and found their dog Hsiao-huang lying on the ground gasping for breath , eyes wide open and staring , with blood trickling from his mouth .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
Pai first heard Mei Lanfang perform the " Walking in the Garden , Waking from a Dream " episode of The Peony Pavilion in Shanghai when he was ten years old . Though he did n't really understand it , the lines , " Once the violet and vermilion blossoms ran riot round the broken walls and through the ruined wells ; What has happened to the glorious times and beautiful scenes , in whose courtyards are pleasures and entertainments now to be found ? " etched themselves into deep into his brain .  
Seeing the industry on the decline hurt him deeply , and when he heard about the Cultural Association 's plan to try and revive it , he leapt straight in , despite not quite getting the idea himself . After reflecting on the current situation-all his children and grandchildren had moved elsewhere to work in other industries , so there would be no-one to carry on the tradition-he decided to devote himself to trying to help rebuild the old farms and give them a second shot at life .  
If the cries of the maimed and killed , their families and friends could be heard , they would demand effective action from responsible and complacent Governments , callous people and the indifferent military .  
Over the years this call , addressed to a world undergoing continuous and rapid change , has not ceased to be heard , even if the voice has sometimes been muted by political and economic circumstances , by wars and calamities , by social movements , and by walls destroyed or raised .  
My delegation has on numerous occasions called for an end to the embargo that has crippled the Cuban economy and , as members heard from the Secretary of the Council of Ministers of Cuba , cruelly endangered the lives of many innocent people , including children , the sick and the elderly , who have had to bear the brunt of untold suffering .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
It had been pointed out in its biennial report for 19961997 that if the Programmes voice was to be loud enough to be heard above the clamour of unfettered economic growth and globalization it would need adequate , stable and predictable funding .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
The Council heard a comprehensive report presented by President Yasser Arafat , in which he discussed all aspects of the political situation and the principal tasks to be accomplished in the Palestinian arena , foremost among which is the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital .  
The hearing shall be attended by a judicial authority of the requested State , assisted by an interpreter where necessary , who shall also be responsible for ensuring both identification of the individual to be heard and compliance with the fundamental principles of the law of the requested State .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this situation , combined with peer pressure and misconceived collegial loyalty , may work to the detriment of civilian victims and their families and seriously circumscribe their opportunities to have their cases heard before a competent , independent and impartial tribunal , as provided for in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary .  
The voting results on this counter-draft resolution and on the original Russian-United States bilateral nuclear arms negotiation that it is designed to belittle will have far more impact on my Government ' s attitude towards the concept of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to nuclear disarmament than will all the rhetoric that we have heard alleging genuine desire in the international community to seek progress towards nuclear disarmament .  
It is a vexing and tragic mosaic of suffering , and its seemingly endless civil war exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation , as we heard in the briefing this morning .  
Not once in this entire sevenyear debate on Security Council reform have we heard any major State declare that it deserves permanent membership because it is willing to give a solemn commitment to put global interests ahead of national interests .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
They heard each member of the Council make comments and ask relevant and specific questions of the President of Rwanda , namely concerning the presence of forces of aggression on the Congolese territory , the permeability of common borders and the need to build a free , secure and democratic Rwandan society based on human rights , equality and respect for diversity .  
UNIFEM believed that it was critical for women to take part in shaping the policies and practices that governed national , regional and global agreements in such areas as social responsibility of corporations , new trade agreements , reconstruction of societies emerging from war , or actions to respond to the scourge of HIV / AIDS . Womens voices and priorities must be heard .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
At its 25th meeting , on 15 August 2001 , the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , having considered the final working paper submitted by the Special Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene A . Daes , on indigenous peoples and their relationship to land ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 2001 / 21 ) , having heard the significant and constructive statement by the Special Rapporteur and expressing deepest appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent , valuable final working paper , decided :
