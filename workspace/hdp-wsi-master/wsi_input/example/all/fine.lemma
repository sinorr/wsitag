These lions are fine statuary , and despite weathering caused by exposure to the European climate the sculptor 's verve is still evident .

Of course , if the targets for expansion of the wild salmon population are reached , there are regulations governing the raising of animals which , strictly applied , should prevent artificially propagated animals from getting mixed into the species in the wild .
