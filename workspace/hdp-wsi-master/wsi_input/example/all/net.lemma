As the state 's stock of grain was doubled and redoubled between 1995 and 1999 , and the grain stored in peasant households exceeded 500 kg per capita during the same period , equivalent to two years ' quantity for personal consumption , we can believe that the total net import volume of 30.19 million tonnes in 1995 and 1996 was not a result of real demand due to domestic grain shortage .

Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .

He most loves early morning in the family compound , pulling aside the bed curtain and the mosquito net , walking out of the room in the entrancing shafts of sunlight , turning into the interior hall , then going through the exterior hall into the forecourt .

The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds .

As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market .

The body 's immune responses to these germs-cell-mediated immunity , which is called " type 1 immune response , " and the " type 2 immune response , " known as humoral immunity-are mutually antagonistic . This can result in imbalances , much like when the police deploy all their forces to catch a big criminal and end up letting small-time thieves slip through the net . To an allergic person 's immune system , finding the right balance is as difficult as it is for a seesaw to stay horizontal with children on it .

The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The net decreases in resources for the economic and social areas which had been noted by some representatives represented significant one-time expenditures approved in 1994-1995 for the major global conferences that had taken place during the current biennium .  
The estimated measurable loss on the basis of the unrealized social product , as well as of the unrealized net inflow of invisible transactions with foreign countries , and on the basis of the additional costs of the increased number of unemployed persons and refugees is US $ 147.3-billion for the entire 1991-2011 period - US $ 45.1-billion for the period 1991-1994 and US $ 102.2-billion for the period 1995-2011 . 
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .

During the same period , total net official development finance fell by about 5 per cent in nominal terms to $ 66 billion in 1994 , after remaining relatively constant at around $ 70-billion between 1990 and 1993 .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .

The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .

Implementation is usually directed towards both increasing economic opportunity - for example , through land reform and land rehabilitation , strengthening the agricultural sector , education and training , job creation , and access to seed capital - and towards providing a social safety net , through the provision of shelter and support to community groups and broad participation in decision-making .  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;

The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
If an Annex A or Annex B Party achieves real reductions in net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases which are greater than that determined by its commitments , this difference ( in terms of the sum of annual reductions of tonnes of carbon equivalent ) is registered as a contribution to the fulfillment of that Party 's commitments for the next period .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .

All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .

The primary goals of enhancing the social safety net of individuals and promoting their integration into society could be achieved only with the firm political will to invest at the national as well as the international level for the well-being of all .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
Any proposal must be examined in light of ( i ) a constrained United Nations budget which leaves no room for net growth in the organization ; ( ii ) the imperative to avoid duplication and to direct scarce United Nations system resources to activities having the greatest impact and benefits ; and ( iii ) the availability of voluntary funding . 
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
Nor is it necessarily desirable to accelerate the process of freeing controlled prices ( it is well known and accepted that public and semi-public housing rents are heavily subsidized in the transition economies and that a move to more economic levels is necessary for an improvement in the housing stock , but this can not be done abruptly as the subsidies are an important part of the social safety net in these countries ) .  
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .

The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
Decides further that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;

The same difficulty resurfaces in the relationship between economic adjustment programmes , on the one hand , and social or environmental goals such as fighting poverty , providing basic education or health , offering a safety net for the unemployed and protecting tropical forests , on the other . 
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
The simple classification of a country as a net exporter or net importer could , however , be misleading in understanding the country-specific impact of the Agreement , as many NFIDCs also had a substantial level of export interest in specific commodities ( mainly cash-crop commodities such as coffee , tea , cotton , soy beans and sugar ) in terms of their shares of total export earnings .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .

In April 1998 , the Interim Committee proposed a broadening of SDDS , so that the system would also cover additional financial data such as net reserves ( after allowance for central banks liabilities under forward or derivative transactions ) , the debt ( in particular the short-term debt ) of economic agents and other indicators bearing on the stability of the financial sector .  
However , key parts of the deterioration ( such as the accumulation in the spring of 1997 by the central bank of Thailand of a large part of the forward exchange liabilities that depleted its net foreign exchange reserves ) may take place during short periods , so that improved disclosure would not necessarily protect the debtor from sudden reactions by creditors and investors which are highly concentrated in time .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Calculate the revised net base floor salaries at the dependency and single rates at each grade and step by increasing the corresponding net salaries from the existing scale by a predetermined percentage by which the existing base floor salary scale is to be increased .

It is generally acknowledged that a comparative income approach is not feasible because of the inability to separate out the implicit unit price and quantity elements , especially in the case of gross or net operating surplus .  
As a consequence , the Secretary-General submitted an updated revised budget for MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 in the amount of $ 47 , 402 , 100 gross ( $ 44 , 419 , 700 net ) ( see A 52-730 Add . 2 ) , which reflected the additional requirements for demining activities while at the same time revising downward the additional requirements for the identification process set out in his earlier report ( A 52-730 ) .

Most countries declared their intention to create an effective and comprehensive safety net , accompanied by efforts to control costs and waste , thereby leading to a more efficient use of resources .  
Although official development finance ( ODF ) has risen from its level in 1996 , that increase of about $ 15-billion has not been sufficient to prevent a sharp drop in the total net resource flow to developing countries in 1998 .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .

The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
This , as noted above , requires in turn an enabling international environment , including dynamic trade opportunities and a substantial , stable and sustained net transfer of resources to developing countries and lowerincome transition economy countries .  
The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .  
It was held pursuant to paragraph 134 of the Bangkok Plan of Action , adopted by UNCTAD X , and its major objective was to identify , on a country-specific basis , challenges and concerns confronting least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) in the face of the reform process in agriculture and to contribute to the formulation of negotiating proposals by LDCs and NFIDCs in the ongoing World Trade Organization ( WTO ) negotiations on agriculture , so as to ensure that those negotiations would effectively address their concerns .

The net unutilized balance of $ 211,700 under this heading was primarily attributable to lower than budgeted requirements under troop costs ( $ 295,900 ) owing to the earlier than anticipated repatriation of contingent personnel , as well as savings under the emplacement , rotation and repatriation of troops as a result of the non-utilization of funds for the repatriation of the medical unit personnel in the absence , during the financial period of a claim , from the Government concerned ( $ 62,800 ) .  
The net additional requirements of $ 900 under this heading were attributable to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance ( $ 354,200 ) and other official travel costs ( $ 435,100 ) , as well as to unforeseen expenditure under the consultants budget line item ( $ 74,400 ) , offset by savings under the international and local staff salaries ( $ 104,700 and $ 171,500 , respectively ) and common staff costs ( $ 589,000 ) .  
The decrease is the net result of the following adjustments : ( a ) the outward redeployment of six posts ( one-P-2 and five General Service ( Other level ) ) to the Library ( Section 2 , General Assembly affairs and conference services ) following the reorganization of that area of activities as detailed above ; ( b ) the conversion of five posts for sound technicians from general temporary assistance to established posts at the General Service level , given the continuous nature of the function .

It was revealed that the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . discovered that its major shareholders and the parties concerned had misappropriated a huge amount of funds , equivalent to 96 percent of its listed net assets , even more than what some major shareholders had misappropriated from " ST Monkey King " during a period of many years .  In this astonishing case , it can be said , the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . has set a vicious example for major shareholders and the parties concerned to misappropriate funds from a listed company .  
Thanks to the comprehensive agricultural development over the past more than 10 years , an average annual increase of 53.17 billion kg has been registered in the country 's grain production capacity , and the newly increased per capita net income of peasants in project areas stands 260 yuan higher at average than that of peasants in non-project areas .  
As the state 's stock of grain was doubled and redoubled between 1995 and 1999 , and the grain stored in peasant households exceeded 500 kg per capita during the same period , equivalent to two years ' quantity for personal consumption , we can believe that the total net import volume of 30.19 million tonnes in 1995 and 1996 was not a result of real demand due to domestic grain shortage .

Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .

Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .  Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .  
Compared with the same quarter in 2000 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2001 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , a small increase in invisible trade surplus , a substantial increase in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .

As the number of families and individuals requiring financial support by the Government is bound to increase given the current economic situation and high unemployment , the adjustment will enable us to ensure that the safety net can be maintained within our means and that existing resources go further to meet the increasing demand . 
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
" Even so , seventy performances in a hundred-seat venue only amounts to a total audience of 7,000 , " says Li , running off figures fast and precise , Woody Allen fashion . " When direct and indirect production costs for the play are taken into account , including auditorium rental and personnel overneads , we are talking about a net loss of NT $ 150,000 . " What then would satisfy him ?  
Now the researchers put on gloves and take the bat from the net , but the little firebrand does not stop trying to stretch forward and bite people , all the while struggling with its wings . Not having rested for an instant , as the time comes for the bat 's release , it lets out an angry sound as if to curse : " Tough luck ! "  
The angry answer comes back that it is society 's search for simplistic explanations that is the problem and that , at his age , the youth is just discovering what a cold , shallow , arrogant culture he lives in - - where the worth of human beings is rated on the basis of the square footage of their homes , their net incomes and exam results , rather than on love and dignity .  
He most loves early morning in the family compound , pulling aside the bed curtain and the mosquito net , walking out of the room in the entrancing shafts of sunlight , turning into the interior hall , then going through the exterior hall into the forecourt . To this day he can not forget that graduated sensation of layers and the harmonious streams of light they created .  
But the charms of the traditional fishing industry are being threatened . Factories on the land emit poisonous waste , deforming the spines of the fish that swim at the mouth of the river . Liao has witnessed large-scale drift nets thrown by large fishing vessels catching all fish large and small . The heavy iron chains of the drift net destroy the sea bed , and it will take the sea bed , which nourishes the sea , decades to heal its wound .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .

Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
Internationally , the trend is certainly for the big to get bigger . For example , at the end of 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland merged with Swiss Bank Corporation , and the following year Deutsche Bank purchased Bankers Trust , while Citibank merged with Travelers Group . This last merger , between two companies that were already giants , gave the resulting firm a solid grip on its ranking as the financial institution with the highest net worth in the world .  
They are equipped not only with radar , wireless communication equipment , and net winches , but everything actually is operable , and even the doors and windows can be opened and closed . His handiwork captures the real thing so well that it 's downright spooky . Even old seadogs gush in praise when they see his boats .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market .

To this end , in October 2003 the center established the Suicide Prevention Center . It also appointed " informers " in police bureaus , fire brigades , and neighborhood hospitals to build a protection net . As soon as the center receives an attempted suicide report from an emergency ward , it tries to conduct a thoroughgoing follow-up and to provide psychological counseling to the patient to prevent another suicide attempt .  
The body 's immune responses to these germs-cell-mediated immunity , which is called " type 1 immune response , " and the " type 2 immune response , " known as humoral immunity-are mutually antagonistic . This can result in imbalances , much like when the police deploy all their forces to catch a big criminal and end up letting small-time thieves slip through the net . To an allergic person 's immune system , finding the right balance is as difficult as it is for a seesaw to stay horizontal with children on it .  
After a while , the bent of his writing gradually turned towards science fiction , philosophy , and the exploration of the human psyche .

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .

Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
Also decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 2,618,600 dollars gross ( 2,217,800 dollars net ) for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,966,500 United States dollars gross ( 1,858,600 dollars net ) , for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 378,600 United States dollars gross ( 373,800 dollars net ) for the period from 16 December 1994 to 16 June 1995 ;  
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
It may be recalled that the General Assembly , in its decision 49 / 483 of 12 July 1995 , decided that there would be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 , inclusive .  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
Fourth , disbursements of official development finance ( ODF ) fell : concessional disbursements of official development assistance ( ODA ) rose in both nominal and real terms , but multilateral net lending on non-concessional terms dropped substantially and bilateral net lending on non-concessional terms rose only slightly .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
Interested developed and developing country partners should reflect their mutual commitment by allocating , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance , including contributions through multilateral organizations and non-governmental organizations and 20 per cent of the national budgets ( net of aid ) , respectively , to basic social services , as soon as possible and preferably by the year 2000 .  
Decides also to appropriate the amount of 4,632,500 dollars gross ( 4,152,200 dollars net ) for the administrative closing of the Assistance Mission for the period subsequent to 19 April 1996 , inclusive of the amount of 50,200 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations , to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution ;  
Decides also to appropriate the amount of 4,632,500 dollars gross ( 4,152,200 dollars net ) for the administrative closing of the Assistance Mission for the period subsequent to 19 April 1996 , inclusive of the amount of 50,200 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations , to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution ;  
Decides further , as an ad hoc and exceptional arrangement , that Member States shall waive their respective shares in the remaining credits arising from previous budgets of the United Nations Protection Force in an amount of 8,455,336 dollars gross ( 8,601,911 dollars net ) , to be transferred to the Special Account for the International Tribunal from the Special Account for the United Nations Protection Force established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 233 of 19 March 1992 ;  
During the same period , total net official development finance fell by about 5 per cent in nominal terms to $ 66 billion in 1994 , after remaining relatively constant at around $ 70-billion between 1990 and 1993 .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
Some Governments have launched initiatives to eradicate poverty , such as stimulating job creation and growth , maintaining an effective safety net consisting of a comprehensive social security system , universal health care and community and education services , and providing adequate housing ; others have adopted national targets to reduce the level of poverty by a certain year .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
They stressed that the solution to the debt problem must go much further than the establishment of transitory relief measures and be based on a genuine joint effort between debtors and creditors without selectivity , taking into account all the dimensions of the problem and ensuring a net transfer of financial resources to indebted countries .  
The family unit in India was very strong and provided the social security net for vulnerable family members ; however , the traditional extended or joint family was increasingly being eroded because of the strains of modern life . 
Many delegations , while supporting in general the proposals for contributions by host governments towards local office costs ( GLOC ) , requested additional information regarding the financial impact of the proposals , in particular the financial impact of applying the revised programme thresholds for providing international staff to some net contributor countries ( NCCs ) , and the impact of the three-year waiver period following graduation .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;

Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;

Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
Implementation is usually directed towards both increasing economic opportunity - for example , through land reform and land rehabilitation , strengthening the agricultural sector , education and training , job creation , and access to seed capital - and towards providing a social safety net , through the provision of shelter and support to community groups and broad participation in decision-making .  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Overall Socioeconomic Perspective for the World Economy ; six working papers on selected macroeconomic issues , including changing world patterns in income distribution , relationships between economic growth and trade , the relationship between economic growth and merchandise trade , financing the social safety net in services , emerging issues in development finance in the twenty-first century and possible strategies for international development in the twenty-first century ;  
Whereas in its original proposal for 1997 the Tribunal had requested approximately $ 69 million net to fund the activities of the Chambers , the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry , which represented a 94 per-cent increase over the 1996 budget and included provision for an additional 197 posts , the review conducted by the Oversight Office had identified at least $ 6 million in savings , including 39 unnecessary and duplicated posts as well as various plans for non-essential spending such as sophisticated audio-visual equipment .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
The Commission also recalled that the current level of the ceiling ( 25 per cent of net salary ) was based on an administrative decision and that a reduction of the ceiling would be beneficial to duty stations with a large non-pensionable component since a lesser proportion of income would be considered non-pensionable and the relationship between income while in service and income after service would improve . 
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Based on relatively little actual experience to draw upon at that time , the updated budget , amounting to $ 276,898,300 gross ( $ 267,676,300 net ) , reflected only minor changes in monthly operating costs with new requirements for non-recurrent cost items that had been identified since the formulation of the original requirements in early 1996 .  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5.6 million dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 dollars gross ( 10-million dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Paragraph 4 indicated that the net reduction of $ 25.1-million reflected the combined effect of projected additional requirements of $ 31.6-million due to changes in inflation assumptions , commitments entered into under resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses and commitments authorized by the General Assembly ; a $ 28.7-million decrease in income ; and an anticipated reduction of $ 85.4-million due to changes in exchange rate assumptions , variations in post and common staff costs and adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts .  
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the International Civil Service Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] taking into account the views expressed by Member States at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
If an Annex A or Annex B Party achieves real reductions in net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases which are greater than that determined by its commitments , this difference ( in terms of the sum of annual reductions of tonnes of carbon equivalent ) is registered as a contribution to the fulfillment of that Party 's commitments for the next period .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of [ 102,706,078 dollars gross ( 105,971,529 dollars net ) ] in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
An integrated approach to the efficient and equitable development and allocation of water resources requires the use of economic and regulatory instruments designed to maximize social net benefits .  
During the first half of the year , the region was receiving substantial private credit inflows on a net basis , continuing a trend that had started in 1996 owing to low international interest rates and improving growth prospects .  
The primary goals of enhancing the social safety net of individuals and promoting their integration into society could be achieved only with the firm political will to invest at the national as well as the international level for the well-being of all .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
Any proposal must be examined in light of ( i ) a constrained United Nations budget which leaves no room for net growth in the organization ; ( ii ) the imperative to avoid duplication and to direct scarce United Nations system resources to activities having the greatest impact and benefits ; and ( iii ) the availability of voluntary funding . 
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
Nor is it necessarily desirable to accelerate the process of freeing controlled prices ( it is well known and accepted that public and semi-public housing rents are heavily subsidized in the transition economies and that a move to more economic levels is necessary for an improvement in the housing stock , but this can not be done abruptly as the subsidies are an important part of the social safety net in these countries ) .  
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;

The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .

The same difficulty resurfaces in the relationship between economic adjustment programmes , on the one hand , and social or environmental goals such as fighting poverty , providing basic education or health , offering a safety net for the unemployed and protecting tropical forests , on the other . 
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
The simple classification of a country as a net exporter or net importer could , however , be misleading in understanding the country-specific impact of the Agreement , as many NFIDCs also had a substantial level of export interest in specific commodities ( mainly cash-crop commodities such as coffee , tea , cotton , soy beans and sugar ) in terms of their shares of total export earnings .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .

In April 1998 , the Interim Committee proposed a broadening of SDDS , so that the system would also cover additional financial data such as net reserves ( after allowance for central banks liabilities under forward or derivative transactions ) , the debt ( in particular the short-term debt ) of economic agents and other indicators bearing on the stability of the financial sector .  
However , key parts of the deterioration ( such as the accumulation in the spring of 1997 by the central bank of Thailand of a large part of the forward exchange liabilities that depleted its net foreign exchange reserves ) may take place during short periods , so that improved disclosure would not necessarily protect the debtor from sudden reactions by creditors and investors which are highly concentrated in time .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Calculate the revised net base floor salaries at the dependency and single rates at each grade and step by increasing the corresponding net salaries from the existing scale by a predetermined percentage by which the existing base floor salary scale is to be increased .

This , as noted above , requires in turn an enabling international environment , including dynamic trade opportunities and a substantial , stable and sustained net transfer of resources to developing countries and lowerincome transition economy countries .  
The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .

The net unutilized balance of $ 211,700 under this heading was primarily attributable to lower than budgeted requirements under troop costs ( $ 295,900 ) owing to the earlier than anticipated repatriation of contingent personnel , as well as savings under the emplacement , rotation and repatriation of troops as a result of the non-utilization of funds for the repatriation of the medical unit personnel in the absence , during the financial period of a claim , from the Government concerned ( $ 62,800 ) .  
The net additional requirements of $ 900 under this heading were attributable to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance ( $ 354,200 ) and other official travel costs ( $ 435,100 ) , as well as to unforeseen expenditure under the consultants budget line item ( $ 74,400 ) , offset by savings under the international and local staff salaries ( $ 104,700 and $ 171,500 , respectively ) and common staff costs ( $ 589,000 ) .  
The decrease is the net result of the following adjustments : ( a ) the outward redeployment of six posts ( one-P-2 and five General Service ( Other level ) ) to the Library ( Section 2 , General Assembly affairs and conference services ) following the reorganization of that area of activities as detailed above ; ( b ) the conversion of five posts for sound technicians from general temporary assistance to established posts at the General Service level , given the continuous nature of the function .
