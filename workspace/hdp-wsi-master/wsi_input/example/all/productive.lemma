Thereby , setting up a scientific and reasonable taxation structure and standardizing tax collection policies are of extremely important significance to accurately and effectively regulating the re-distribution of national income , promoting the distribution of essential productive factors , directing the optimum distribution of resources , increasing employment opportunities , and facilitating the sustained and sound development of the economy .  
So long as our party always acts as the faithful representative of the demands of the development of the advanced social productive forces in the China , the direction of the development of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party will forever be in an invincible position , and will forever have the heartfelt support of the people of all ethnic groups of the country and continuously lead them forward .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
So long as our party can always remain the loyal representative of the development demands of China 's advanced productive forces in society , the progress orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our party can forever put itself in an invincible position , can forever win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can lead the people to make constant progresses .  
Once we have advanced productive forces and an advanced social system , we can create more and better material and spiritual wealth ; can get a firm foothold , and can march at the head in our competition with different countries and different forces ; and can develop greater power to enhance the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .  
He said : In future , we will further arm the entire party with Deng Xiaoping Theory so that our party will always meet the requirements for the development of the advanced social productive forces , march in the direction toward an advanced culture , be the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the Chinese people , lead the entire country and people to cope with various difficulties and challenges , and victoriously stride into the 21st century .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
Hu Jintao emphasized that the key to seizing and using well the opportunity of the great development of the west to speed up economic and social development lies in doing a good job in building the party organizations at all levels ; in particular , the leading cadres at all levels must play a model role , firmly advance in the forefront of emancipating and developing the productive forces and promoting the building of the two civilizations , and unite and lead the masses to work hard together .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the ï¿½t hree represents .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have worked to sum up historical experience , to carry out reform and opening , to concentrate on economic construction , thereby generating unprecedented development of the productive forces , tremendous improvement in comprehensive national capability , marked improvement in people 's lives , and comprehensive social progress .  
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
Deputy Huang Qifan said : To act as the representative of the advanced productive forces and to be the direction of an advanced culture , it is necessary to continuously forge ahead and perform new meritorious deeds , concentrate our energies on the economic development and the building of spiritual civilization , and accomplish comprehensive and harmonious social development .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
Since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was launched , our party has asserted , in accordance with the theory on China being on the initial stage of socialism , that liberating and developing the productive forces is the essential demand and fundamental task of socialism and proceeded to formulate its own basic line , basic program , and a set of principles and policies , with the stress on unwavering adherence to the party 's basic line , focusing on unwavering adherence to economic construction being the center of all endeavors .  
However , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Under the new historical conditions , through summing up the historical experiences since the founding of the party , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a new , comprehensive , and complete epitome of the advanced nature of the party .  During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
In other words , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but is historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
As long as our party always becomes the faithful representative of the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China our party can always establish itself in an unassailable position , always enjoy the heartfelt support of the people of all nationalities in the whole country , and lead the people to constantly forge ahead .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people are closely interrelated and can embody the essential needs of socialism .  Of these three , the overriding one is representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .  
When inspecting in Guangdong , General Secretary Jiang Zemin noted : Our Party can always stand in a position of permanent victory , receive wholehearted support from all the people nationwide and lead them to march on unceasingly , provided that our Party all along represents the development requirements from the advanced social productive forces in China , represents the development of Chinese advanced culture and represents the essential interests of the overwhelming majority of Chinese people .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
So long as our party can loyally represent at all times the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party can always remain at an invincible position , can always win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can lead the people to forge forward on a constant basis . "  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
Today , by stressing that our party should always represent the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , Comrade Jiang Zemin has upheld and further elaborated , under the present new situation , the most fundamental realistic foundation and philosophical prerequisite of the party-building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
The advancedness of our party is rooted in the historical position of China 's working class which represents the development demands of the social productive forces of our time ; and which is tempered , cultivated , and formed in the protracted struggle .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
So long as it always becomes a loyal representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces , the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
While inspecting Guangdong Province in February of this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that , " Only if our Party is from start to finish the developmental requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of advance of China 's advanced culture , and the faithful representative of the basic interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , only then can our Party forever occupy an invincible position , always obtain the wholehearted support of all the people of this nation , and continually lead the people forward . "  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
To really practice Marxism , it is imperative to meet the requirements of the " three represents " that Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward recently , that is , our party should always represent the development needs of the China 's advance social productive forces , the onward direction of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the largest number of the Chinese people .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
Recently , Comrade Jiang Zemin stated that our party must always be the loyal representative that meets the requirements for development of advanced social productive forces of China , that is in line with the development trend of China 's advanced culture , and that is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people .  
During the 10-year calamity , our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of " developing social productive forces " ; as a result , the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
The standard of our productive forces has risen substantially ; we have further gained comprehensive national strength , and the people as a whole have attained a comfortable standard of living .  
It has accurately epitomized and given a high appraisal to the following three major changes in history .  Namely , the productive forces have been greatly intensified , and the people have generally attained a moderately high standard of living .  Also , three major changes have taken place in social and economic activities in market supply and demand , in institutional environment in economic development , and in economic relations with foreign countries .  
Liu : First of all , we must ascertain that development is the main theme .  We are faced with the political pressure of international hegemonism , the pressure from the developed countries with their superiority in high technology , and our arduous tasks in China 's modernization drive .  Only by greatly raising our productive forces , can we build a material foundation to solve all kinds of social problems .  
From ancient wars through cold-weapon wars and hot-weapon wars to modern mechanized wars and high-tech wars , what weapons to use when a country goes to war is not determined by the subjective will of man , but by the level of productive forces prevailing at the time .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
All this does not tally with the guideline set by the 15th National CPC Congress . To give private enterprises equal treatment is not an expedient measure under the condition of underdeveloped productive forces .  It is a long-term policy for at least 100 years required by our basic system during the initial stage of socialism .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .  " I 'm involved with you and you with me , " and this becomes a powerful , material force restraining world war .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
NPC deputy Zhan Zhongfu cited an example : Take " representing China 's advanced social productive forces " ; how could we speed up development during the Ninth FYP , when we faced the main trend of economic globalization , the rapid development of the revolution in science and technology , and fierce international competition ?  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must persevere in orienting ourselves to the market without wavering at all and ceaselessly eliminate the institutional impediments to the development of productive forces and improve the socialist market economy so as to provide a mighty driving force and institutional guarantee for national economic and social development .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
To keep alive its advanced nature , our party should concentrate on developing the social productive forces , closely follow the major trend of development in the world in terms of science and technology and economy , take economic construction as the center , combine the advanced trends in the knowledge economy , science and technology progress , and social development in an organic way , and strive to serve well as the representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
When new China was established , for historical reasons the mother mainland laid particular stress on putting politics in command and emphasized ideology ; it violated the laws of economic development , and in particular this went to extremes during the " 10-year cultural revolution , " causing great damage to the social productive forces and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy . 
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
At another Senate hearing held the other day , James Kelly , US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , also said : On issues ranging from advocating peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula to non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and to trade , we have shared interests with China , and a productive and positive relationship is bound to benefit the United States most .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
Economically , the relationship of production characterized by the monopoly of the three major estate-holders was abolished , and ownership by individual farmers and herdsmen was established .  The vast number of former serfs and slaves began to possess their own land , sheep , cattle , and means of production .  This greatly aroused their initiative for production and emancipated the productive forces .  
Special efforts should be made to guide the vast number of demobilized cadres to consciously study and implement the important thinking of " three represents " and transform the requirement on communist party members to represent the advanced social productive forces and advanced culture into concrete deeds of subordinating themselves to the vital and overall interest , accepting the arrangement of the party organization , and taking the needs of the party cause into consideration .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The CPC , which had captured victory nationwide , was faced with a daunting challenge : Can it create advanced productive forces on the basis of old China , where poverty and backwardness had been endemic , and raise the living standard of the masses ?  " A serious economic construction task confronts us . "  
History fully shows that the CPC , which all along represents the development requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , represents the advancing direction of China 's advanced culture , and represents the fundamental interests of the broadest Chinese people , is worthy of the title of a great , glorious , and correct party .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
We must stick with the national strategy of making the country prosperous through science and technology implementation and targeting continuous development , making efforts to learn , master , and apply cutting edge science and technology to achieve breakthroughs in social productive forces for China on the foundation of technology advancement , and we must continuously improve China 's overall national capacity and international competitiveness .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
It must closely follow the trend of development and progress in the world , always represent the requirement for the development of the advanced productive forces in China , the direction for the advancement of advanced culture , and the basic interests of the broad masses of people , and resolutely resolve prominent problems in the party .  The starting point and the focus of attention of my putting forward the requirement for persisting in ' three represents ' lie here . "  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
Reviewing the course of struggle and the basic experience over the past 80 years and looking into the arduous tasks and bright future in the new century , our party should continue to stand in the forefront of the times and lead the people in marching from victory to victory .  In a word , we must always represent the development needs of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practicable steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by our party was to abrogate the imperialist privileges in China , eliminate exploitation and oppression by the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class , change the comprador feudal production relations and the rotten political superstructure built on such an economic base , establish a new political superstructure with the people 's democratic dictatorship as the core and fundamentally emancipate the fettered productive forces .  
Over the past 20-plus years , we have conducted bold explorations and practices and pushed forward the reforms in economic and political structures and other areas and greatly emancipated and developed China 's social productive forces , thereby bringing about tremendous changes in national economic development and social progress .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
Participating comrades held : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech reiterated that the working class is the representative of China 's advanced productive forces and our party should always adhere to the fundamental guiding principle of wholehearted reliance on the working class .  This is a tremendous encouragement and spur to the Chinese working class .  
It is implementing the reform and opening up policy that spurred the national economy to develop in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner and raised the social and productive forces , overall national strength and people 's standard of living to higher levels .  
General secretary of CPC Jiang Zemin pointed out at the meeting that " science and technology is the primary productive force as well an intensified representation and major symbol of the advanced productive force . "  Therefore , we must sharply capture the objective trend , advocate the " two bombs and one satellite " spirit carried on by the old generations of science and technology workers , never giving up pursuing the summit of science and technology .  
Summing up the course of endeavor and basic experiences over 80 years , and looking to the arduous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must - - in sum - - always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
To constantly develop advanced productive forces and culture is , in the final analysis , aimed at meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and continuously realizing the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people . "  
As long as our party always faithfully represents the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces , the advance development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever , win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout China forever , and lead the people to forge ahead ceaselessly .  
To promote productive forces under the national condition that ours is a big and populous country with scarce farmland and a weak economic foundation , we must keep strict control over population growth , and must work hard to improve the population quality .  
We have seen clearly that the poor level of productive forces is a major factor that determines people 's willingness in having children .  In view of this , China has worked out its population program and population policies that conform with reality , which have not only successfully ensured healthy development for the country 's population and family planning undertaking ; but has also served to promote the country 's economic growth , push forward social progress , improve the living standards of the people , and enhance the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
In light of the ongoing " three stresses " education activities , Chen Gang , chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the Dongbei Pharmaceutical Group , said : In the past few years , the Pharmaceutical Group , proceeding from the requirement of representing advanced social productive forces , renovated its structure and management and accelerated the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  In this way , the company was able to re-emerge from the brink of bankruptcy and to return to the road of rapid growth .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
We must accord full importance to the functions and role of public finance , implement a correct fiscal policy , and readjust and optimize the composition of outlays in a timely way in order to better serve the development of advanced productive forces and the promotion of the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
After the establishment of New China , China 's athletic project has developed rapidly .  Particularly during the 20 years since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy , China 's national economy has developed in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner ; the social and productive forces , the overall national strength , people 's life and the athletic level have been greatly improved .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that " as long as our Party always represents the requirements of the development of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our Party will be in an invincible position , will always receive the great support of the people of every ethnic group across the country and will lead the people in continuously pressing ahead . "  
These units have also provided many good farming and breeding skills for Tibet residents without compensation .  These years , they have changed their assistance steps and methods in a timely manner .  They have depended on their farms and production bases and exploited their professional , technological , and equipment advantages to translate many research achievements into social productive forces , thus greatly promoting the development of society , the economy , and productive forces of Tibet as well as the improvement of people 's living standards .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market . 
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
in terms of new development , the important concept of " three represents " has enriched and developed the Marxist theory of political parties , classes , and the masses according to the fundamental tenets of Marxism on the relationship between the productive forces and production and between the economic base and the superstructure , by keeping the new century in mind , and by proceeding from the laws of social development and the basic nature of the party ;  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .  One of the basic needs for us to " represent the requirements of the development of advanced productive forces " is to quicken railway development and to strive to change the current insufficient capacity of railway transportation as soon as possible .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
Both sides have seen continuous high-level exchanges , rapid development in trade relations , ever expanding economic and technological cooperation , and productive exchanges in cultural , sports , and other areas .  The forum plans to officially set up a trade representative office in China this year .  
create a sound social order environment for economic development ; and protect and promote the development of the advanced productive forces .  We must resolutely wipe out the ugly social phenomena , such as pornography , gambling , and narcotics ; strengthen management of cultural entertainment places and cultural markets ; firmly crack down on illegal and criminal activities using feudal superstition and religion ; enhance people 's sense of the legal system and ethics ;  
3 .  The " speech " uses the " three represents " important idea to sums up history , analyze reality , and look into the future ; reveals the scientific connotation of representing the requirement of the development of the advanced productive forces , the orientation of the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , as well as their inherent relationships ; and uses the " three represents " as a guideline to put forward the basic tasks of stepping up and improving party building .  
According to experts , China has an ample supply of resources and a surplus of productive capacity .  A buyers ' market is taking shape and there is substantial material guarantee .  An increase in fiscal deficits and government debts can arouse the hidden production factors and stimulate economic growth .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

In the more than 50 years since the founding of New China , especially in the 20-odd years since the start of reform and opening up , our country 's productive forces have developed rapidly , our overall national strength has noticeably increased , the people 's living standards have generally improved , the unity of nationalities has been continuously strengthened , social stability has prevailed , our country 's international prestige has steadily grown , and China has now become one of the countries which have developed fastest in the world .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
refines and summarizes anew the Marxist points on the communist party 's advanced nature ; unveils the substance and implication of the communist party 's advanced nature from the high plane of the law of social development as well as the communist party 's intrinsic progressive quality .  In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .  
Science and technology in ancient China produced some stellar results , but there were some inadequacies , mainly in that no tradition of experimental science was formed and there was no system of academic disciplines .  Science and technology did not gain the social status that it needed , and the impetus and mechanisms by which science and technology could advance the development of the social productive forces were lacking .  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Reportedly , during his inspection tour to the south last February , Jiang Zemin pointed out the need to keep the CPC " a faithful representative of the requirements in the development of advanced productive forces in China , the orientation of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China . " This was later called the " three represents . "  As it was not a " comprehensive exposition , " it was not noticed at that time .  
We must - - from the high planes of promoting the development of the social productive forces , advancing the development of the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " three represents " - - seize the opportunity and take advantage of the favorable situation to forge ahead and spare no effort in creating a new situation in anti-narcotics work to make fresh , even greater contributions to completely prohibiting narcotics .  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
He emphatically pointed out : His thesis that our party should " always be a requirement in the development of advanced productive force in China - - - - a faithful representative of the fundamental interest of the greatest majority of the Chinese people " means that such a historic mission should be carried out as a dynamic historical process .  
Li Chongfu believes that " always be " and " faithful representative " mean that the party 's line , principles and policies and its overall political guidance formulated and implemented during any time must be adapted to the situation of that time and to local conditions , and they must reflect the law and requirements of the development of productive forces , reflect the wish of the working masses , and be able to promote the development of productive forces and the social progress .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
integrated reform efforts , development speed , and social capacity for acceptance ; and formulated a series of principles and policies on developing the productive forces .  We should seize opportunities and advance in an enterprising spirit so as to secure a new great victory in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization .  
When we interviewed some party 's theoretical workers in the capital and other places , they all expressed the same understanding with different languages , pointing out that history and the people have chosen the CPC because it represents the advanced social productive forces , the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the great majority of the people since it was founded . 
We should throw into the garbage heap all the ideas and actions that run counter to the " three represents , " as well as all the feudal , superstitious , and unhealthy bourgeois ideas that have corroded our party organizations and party members , but we should uphold all the statements and actions that are capable of promoting the development of productive forces , conducive to heightening the advanced cultural level , and tallying with the people 's immediate and long-term interests .  
In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .  
In particular , the implementation of measures designed to exercise aggregate control , readjust the economic structure , close down " five kinds of small enterprises , " and eliminate the backward productive capacity has played an important role in pushing for a rebound in industrial efficiency .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
In economic restructuring , there have been marked improvements in the aggregate control of some surplus and obsolete productive capacities and products , such as the textile , coal , metallurgical industries , and the electronic information industry is becoming a new impetus to economic growth .  
In the meantime , we should strengthen law enforcement and prosecute according to law those engaged in illegal productive activities such as unauthorized extraction of minerals , excessive pumping of underground water , and indiscriminate construction , which bring on geological disasters causing enormous losses .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : We should persistently carry out reform to innovate relevant systems , perfect the socialist market economy system , and make the production relations and the superstructure meet the needs of the constantly developing productive forces and economic base .  
In his final days , he wrote " Politics and Economics Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat " and other articles , despite his illness , to explain the basic theory of Marxism and put forward a series of important ideas and viewpoints on strengthening relations between the party and the people , developing the social productive force and exploring the correct ways for China 's socialist construction .  
The rapid progress of science and technology in the world , especially the development of information technology , has created new and broad prospects for the development of the productive force and the society .  It is creating a profound influence on political , economic , military , science and technology , culture and social fields of various countries .  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
Under the system of multiparty cooperation led by the CPC , the democratic parties unite and cooperate with the ruling party in exerting for the cause of building socialism .  Together , they have created a stable environment for liberating and developing the productive forces and maintaining the sustainable development of the economy , thus enabling China to make achievements of world interest in economic construction .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .  
In holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory and sticking unwaveringly to the basic line of the Party , the most important thing is insisting on economic development as the center , concentrating our efforts and being unwavering in our development of the social productive forces .  
In the new century , we must vigorously promote progress and innovation in science and technology in China , getting science and technology to play a major role as the first productive force , continually providing a powerful motive force for China 's economic and social development and enabling China to achieve new and greater development in the intense international competition of the future .  
According to the source , the CPC holds that while in the process of " speeding up " industrialization , China is facing the rare opportunities of the extensive application of achievements in the scientific and technological revolution , the massive transformation of information technology , and the large-scale upgrading of traditional industries .  Hence , it must spur industrialization with informationization , give play to its advantage in " gaining the initiative by surpassing the early starters , " and strive to catch up from behind and realize the rapid development of the social productive forces .  
The highly effective application of aerospace technology in the fields of telecommunications , broadcast , meteorology , resources , satellite navigation and orientation , and so on has brought about tremendous changes in human productive forces and lifestyles and pushed forward economic development and social progress .  
The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .  
During this period , it was the " spring of science , " in which science and technology , as the primary productive forces , were more and more closely integrated with the economic construction .  In particular , with the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and technology being defined as the basic national policy , acceleration of scientific and technological progress was placed in an important position of economic and social development .  
As the primary productive forces , science and technology are growing and expanding rapidly in the fields ranging from synthetic insulin to the cultivation of hybrid rice high-yield variety , and from human genome plan to the basic research and development of nanometer technologies , and the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress to the national economic growth has rapidly risen to nearly 40 percent .  
Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
To persevere in scientific and technological innovation , we must transform the scientific and technological potentialities into practical productive forces , enable it to become the primary driving force for economic and social development , create a favorable environment for innovation , carry out in-depth scientific and educational reforms , and make great effort to encourage innovation ;  
During his inspection tour of Guangdong , he particularly emphasized again that as long as our party always faithfully represents the development needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of China 's advanced cultural progress , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the Chinese people , our party will always be invincible , always win the sincere support of the people of various ethnic groups across the country , and always lead the people in their advances .  
As China 's only agricultural high-technology industrial demonstration zone , Yangling should study and apply well the important ideology on " three represents , " really regard the development requirements for advanced productive forces , the orientation of advancement of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest number of people as the criteria for teaching , scientific research , technological development and all fields of work , and build the Yangling demonstration zone into a first-grade agricultural base for agricultural scientific research and technological development at home and abroad . .  
pay close attention to the tests facing party building under complicated domestic and foreign situations , carry out in-depth study of outstanding problems existing within the party , and earnestly solve them according to the important ideas of the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " ;  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the social productive forces in our country have continuously developed , our comprehensive national strength has greatly increased , the people 's living standards have noticeably improved , and our country 's international standing has risen day by day .  
The important purpose of systemic innovation is to overcome the factors in the relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the development of the productive forces and to keep liberating and developing the productive forces .  We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
This " give-and-take " strategic readjustment became the mainline of the " Eighth Five-year Plan , " and during the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , this was combined with the overall readjustment of the setup of the municipality 's productive forces to promote the continuous " upgrading " of the standard and the quality of the secondary and tertiary industries .  
Wen Jiabao says after more than 20 years , China 's rural reform has achieved huge success .  Agriculture 's comprehensive productive capacity has scaled one height after another ; the peasants ' living standard has clearly improved , and the outlook of the rural society has undergone dramatic changes .  
Economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , and is the new height and stage of this development , in which resources and social production factors are allocated in the most effective way on a global scale .  It represents the most advanced production mode and productive force hitherto seen in human society and will become the economic base of world peace , universal harmony , and the future new society of mankind .  
In measuring China 's political system and political party system , the fundamental point is to proceed from China 's national conditions and from the actual results of China 's revolution , construction , and reform .  First , we must see whether the system can promote the sustained development of the social productive forces and comprehensive social progress .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
They highly praised the brilliant achievements scored in China under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , and felt elated and inspired by the sustained development of social productive forces , the continuously elevated standards of the people 's material and cultural lives , the gradual advance of the socialist democratic politics , and the excellent situation of national unity , national unification , and social stability .  
The party at large must center on this topic , conduct investigations and studies , reach a consensus , and respond by taking into full account changes in the international and domestic situations , growth of our country 's productive forces and profound transformations of the economic system , calls for the development of the material and cultural life of the masses , and major changes in the contingent of party members and cadres .  
Therefore , not only must we not engage in low-standard , blind , and redundant constructions , but we must also eliminate backward productive capability to form the mechanism that allows the superior to eliminate the inferior and in turn achieve vertical elevation of the economy 's overall quality .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
If we are unable to achieve breakthroughs in the progress of agricultural science and technology , it will be hard to enhance the comprehensive productive forces in agriculture and agricultural competitiveness , and it will then be hard to meet the demands of all-round building of a comfortably well-off living standard .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
The ninth five-year plan was smoothly completed ; social productive forces and comprehensive national strength have risen to a new level ;  
The new technological revolution , represented by information technology , biotechnology , and nanometer technology , is now profoundly changing the traditional economic structure , production organization , and operational modes and is bringing about a leap in the quality of the development of productive forces .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
We stress the importance of unleashing and developing productive forces and building an advanced culture , but the purpose of all this is , in the final analysis , to realize , develop , and safeguard the people 's interests and continuously meet the ever-increasing material and cultural demands of the general public .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
Faced with the new situation and tasks during the 10th FYP , in order to achieve the development goals for the new century , it is essential to continue to persist in emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , speed up the pace of system reforms and innovation , continually remove system-style obstacles constraining the development of the social productive forces , and further perfect the socialist market economy system , so as to create a still more favorable system environment and conditions for economic development .  
In line with the principle of getting some things done and leaving others alone , Zhejiang should grasp a number of key technologies and common technologies related to the overall situation of economic development to make breakthroughs at key points , pay particular attention to converting the fruits of science and technology into modern productive forces , continue to develop hi-tech industries , and devote efforts to speeding up the application of high technology and advanced applied technology to revamp traditional industries , so as to promote still faster and better development of Zhejiang 's economy .  
President Jiang Pointed out : Through more than two decades of development , our country has initially built a socialist market economic system , formed the pattern of opening to the outside world in all directions , gained valuable experiences in controlling complicated situations and coping with various risks , and made a marked advance in increasing the productive forces and the comprehensive national strength ; the self-confidence and cohesion of the people of various nationalities across the country have been continuously strengthened .  All this has laid a solid foundation for our continuing advance .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
Now , we have drawn a lesson from our painful experience .  The new round of industrial revolution in today 's world , like a tidal wave , is not only posing a grim challenge to us , but also providing us with a historical opportunity whereby we can catch up with the new revolution in science and technology and achieve leap-forward development of the productive forces .  
In the coming five years , it is imperative to unswervingly carry forward reform , open the country wider to the outside world , remove structural barriers hamstringing the development of productive forces , and provide economic development with a powerful dynamic force .  
On fiscal policy , Mr Kwong said : " Our sound financial position depends largely on our strict discipline in controlling expenditure and our efforts in maintaining a stable and productive revenue base .  
Notwithstanding the sharp currency depreciation in the region , the price competitiveness of Hong Kong 's exports was preserved to a considerable extent by the continued downward adjustment in export prices , moderating domestic inflation , and upgrading of productive efficiency and product quality . 
" To maintain our US / HK dollar link , we have an effective currency board system backed by the third largest foreign reserves in the world , a high savings rate , a strong fiscal position with no government foreign debt , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent , flexible , labour force and first-class infrastructure . "  
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
Members are aware that in the 1998 / 99 Budget I announced last February and in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address last October , a wide range of measures to enhance Hong Kong 's productive capacity and competitive edge were set out .  They underline our resolve to seek greater achievements in science and technology , industrial innovation , infrastructure , development of human resources and efficiency and cost effectiveness of the government .  
He also considered that the most productive focus for international and national economic reforms lay in the four key areas of strengthening financial markets , reducing vulnerability to short term capital flows , promoting greater transparency at all levels , and involving private creditors in debt resolution arrangements .  
" Any proposed new taxes would need to meet the criteria of being revenue productive on a recurrent basis , with revenue productivity largely immune to economic cycles and the impact of e-commence , cost effective to administer , simple to comply with and , of course , equitable , " he said . 
Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
The general planning intention of the area is to conserve the intrinsic natural character of the scenic hilly landscape on the western and northern parts , to promote recreation and productive agriculture on the valley floors , to upgrade the obsolete and sub-standard housing in the central and southern parts , and to maintain the character and intensity of the residential developments in the area .  
This great tradition is seen in the annual increase in the number of overseas Chinese visitors , their augmented investment in productive enterprises here , their insistent and courageous resistance to Chinese Communist united front temptations , and especially in their active moral and physical support of the government in their motherland during the last two months . "  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
" the goal of this revolution is to further liberate and develop the productive forces , and to turn our underdeveloped socialist country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced and modern socialist country , and that will demonstrate the superiority of socialism in china , " jiang said  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) has been impeded by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , mainly at the local level , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
Develop economic policies to mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Much productive work of great social importance is not remunerated , such as caring for children and the elderly , protecting the environment and providing voluntary assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups .  
The causes of poverty were varied and complex , and to alleviate it would require increasing domestic saving , investing in productive sectors , diversifying the economy and creating a favourable international economic environment .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
The poverty alleviation programme aims to enable every Malawian to have access to basic necessities and to be able to develop and exploit his or her full potential to lead a productive , dignified and creative life through social , economic and political empowerment .  
Our Government is fully convinced that if we are to enjoy sustained medium - and long-term growth it must be based on an efficient and competitive productive sector , both domestically and internationally , and to that end we have adopted the requisite economic policy measures .  
We consider that implementation of the Programme of Action is urgent , with a view to establishing a framework for economic growth and sustainable development , and a national and international climate favourable to social development , to the elimination of poverty , to increasing productive employment , to reducing unemployment and to fostering social integration .  
These would include creating and reviving national institutions , rebuilding and expanding the infrastructure , revitalizing the economy and creating and expanding social services , so that the Palestinian people may re-emerge as a proud , productive , independent , sovereign nation , with its own flag flying over all its territory , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , and with full status as a Member State of the United Nations .  
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Deeply concerned about the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to education , training and literacy programmes ,

Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Economic opportunities for rural women should be improved through elimination of legal , social , cultural and practical obstacles to women 's participation in economic activities and ensuring that women have equal access to productive resources .  
Efforts are needed to acknowledge the social and economic importance and value of unremunerated work and to facilitate labour force participation in combination with such work through flexible working arrangements , encouraging voluntary social activities as well as broadening the very conception of productive work and to accord social recognition for such work [ including , by reflecting its value in the satellite accounts of the gross national product ] .

Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
A productive agriculture is an essential prerequisite of SARD , with its multiple objectives of reducing poverty and improving livelihoods while conserving and protecting the natural resource base .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .

Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .

Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .

Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
The World Summit for Social Development was remarkable in its scope : it gave a comprehensive meaning to social development , encompassing the functioning of society and all institutions for the overall objective of the betterment of the human condition and it placed people at the centre of all concerns and policies for sustainable development , proclaiming that all human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with the environment .  
The unique character of the Congress , in which the participants combined political leverage and expertise , and which served as a forum for the world-wide sharing of knowledge , exchange of experience and transfer of technological know-how , has been widely recognized , and its productive results were emphasized both at the Congress and at the Commission 's subsequent session . 
Discrimination in education and training , hiring and remuneration , promotion and horizontal mobility practices , as well as inflexible working conditions , lack of access to productive resources and inadequate sharing of family responsibilities , combined with a lack of or insufficient services such as child care , continue to restrict employment , economic , professional and other opportunities and mobility for women and make their involvement stressful .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .

While stabilization policies of demand restraint are designed to put a floor under a downward spiral in key economic indicators and are critical for the resumption of growth , long-term sustained economic development requires an improvement in the economy 's productive capacity that can only be accomplished by active policies on the supply side . 
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
While stabilization policies of demand restraint are designed to put a floor under a downward spiral in key economic indicators and are critical for the resumption of growth , long-term sustained economic development requires an improvement in the economy 's productive capacity that can only be accomplished by active policies on the supply side . 
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) was hampered by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
it was the economic and social marginalization of poor countries which deprived children of the right to realize their physical and intellectual potential , complete their education , find work and become well-adjusted , economically productive and socially responsible adults .  
In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
The human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge of our time and a serious threat to humanity .  The socio-economic consequences of the disease are a matter of grave concern , and the international community should make concerted efforts to address this human tragedy which affects the young and the productive sectors of our societies in particular before it is too late .  
In response to our d \ x { 5e66 } arche , the Secretary-General informed us that he had submitted to the executive heads of the specialized agencies a series of proposals for the establishment of inter-agency task forces aimed at providing strong coordinated support for country-level action , in the areas of the extension of basic social services , access by the poor to productive assets and employment and the creation of an enabling environment for poverty eradication and social development . 
The Government has formulated specific and concrete plans aimed at modernizing the productive structures of the country , in order to legitimize a new economic plan through genuine proposals for social development , based on the concept of social solidarity and good governance .  
At the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen our Heads of State and Government committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty , expanding productive sectors , creating employment , and creating a favourable and enabling environment for world economic recovery and growth through decisive international and national action .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to provide Nicaragua , at the request of its Government , with all possible assistance to support the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development in such areas as caring for displaced persons , land ownership and land tenure in rural areas , appropriate care for war-disabled persons , mine clearance and the overcoming of difficulties in the restoration of the productive areas of the country , and , in general , a process of sustained economic and social recovery and development so that the peace and democracy already achieved become irreversible ;  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
The Commission may recall that at its fourth session , all delegations and representatives of the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that contributed to the debate on the Ninth Congress expressed their satisfaction with the successful conduct of the proceedings and its productive results , in spite of the fact that the time available for pre-Congress consultations and the Ninth Congress itself had to be shortened , that the venue of the Congress had to be changed , and that all preparatory arrangements had to be completed in only a few months .  
Recognizing the need for effective government and efficient public administrative services to be responsive to the needs of the people , to ensure universal access to quality services and productive assets and to create an enabling environment for sustainable development and provide quality services ,  
The Working Group took note that concerning offshore oil and gas activities , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) had concluded that harmonized environmental regulations had been and were being developed in specific regional programmes , and such discussions were proving productive .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Provide assistance to Governments in support of poverty-alleviation efforts designed to improve the economic status of women , in the framework of national policy and legislation and focusing on productive employment generation and poverty alleviation , working conditions and social protection , skill training schemes , especially with respect to managerial , supervisory and high-level positions , and income-generating activities ; introduce reproductive health and other population components into existing income-generation activities ( ILO , UNFPA , UN / DDSMS ) .  
Recognizing that effectiveness of government requires an efficient and effective public administration in all countries that is responsive to the needs of the people , promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable people-centred development ,  
In summary they are those whose ownership of assets or access to productive resources and whose capacity to participate in new opportunities is so low as to make it difficult for them to have the basic minimum of consumption and services required for a decent life .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
The foreseeable developments in the international context - economic , political and institutional - following the Uruguay Round and the advance of regional and subregional integration agreements can offer some opportunities for countries whose productive and export-driven development has been retarded ; nevertheless , they also entail a significant erosion of the opportunities for implementing selective policies to promote such development .  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
The national and regional development work-sites , which in times of economic difficulty and in the absence of any sustained creation of productive , stable and permanent jobs , as well as in periods of drought , constitute supplementary employment programmes . 
Kenya has had a long and productive association with the AALCC , and it is therefore with pleasure that I address the Assembly on behalf of the Kenya delegation to express our warm thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General and secretariat of the AALCC for their outstanding work in promoting interregional and international cooperation , supportive of the efforts of the United Nations , with a view to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the progressive development and codification of international law as well as in economic and humanitarian matters .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
They also have been asked by many States engaged in democratization to help encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens in political processes , and to foster the emergence of a productive civil society , including responsible and independent communications media .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Responding to this productive mood , and convinced that we could advance the process if we continued , our delegations proposed and the Fourth Committee agreed to defer action on the draft resolution and continue the informal dialogue to tackle the more difficult issues still outstanding .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .  
Strengthened international cooperation and the application of appropriate national policy will also contribute to ensuring a stable environment conducive to promoting social development , including reduction of unemployment and generation of productive employment in developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .  
The process of urbanization facilitates sustainable development by giving more people access to productive and sustainable technologies and reducing pressure on ecologically fragile areas ; but it poses enormous problems for urban planning and management , which must meet the growing demand for energy , water and transportation , while coping with increasing volumes of solid , liquid and gaseous wastes .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons . 
The Parties shall promote the maintenance and development , on a mutually advantageous basis , of productive and scientific and technological cooperation between economic agents , particularly in the development and production of modern goods employing advanced technology , including items for defence needs , through , inter alia , the formulation of comprehensive inter-State and intersectoral cooperation programmes .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
In the United States , the Department of Justice is engaged in an ongoing initiative to establish effective and productive working relationships between the federal Government and state governments and local governmental subdivisions .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
In order to achieve those objectives , it was necessary to establish a modern legal framework in order to protect intellectual property and attract external resources for productive investment and , lastly , to ensure the participation of civil society and the integration of society with a view to harmonious and balanced development .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
The goal of education is to make people wiser , more knowledgeable , better informed , ethical , responsible , critical and capable of continuing to learn , and more productive and creative in the workplace .  
That required an approach to development which valued responsible economic management , respected human rights , affirmed gender equity , assured access to productive assets and met basic human needs .  
The basic idea was to integrate the most disadvantaged population groups into the national economy and to guarantee them equal opportunity for access to basic services , decent housing , productive employment and an adequate standard of living .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
It adopted the Istanbul Declaration , in which the nations present endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more liveable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
Whatever the outcome on public funding arrangements , the essential role of the private sector in the productive , entrepreneurial aspects of sustainable forest management needs to be recognized , reinforced and promoted .  
While stabilization strategy is designed to calm financial and economic turbulence by curbing high inflation rates and curtailing enormous budget deficits in the short term , structural adjustment is aimed at restructuring the productive capacities in order to increase efficiency and help restore growth and , therefore , extends over the medium and long term .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
It would require the support of the international community in order , inter alia to promote full employment as a basic priority of economic and social policies and to encourage the formulation of policies and strategies , at the national and regional level , that would meet the basic needs of the people , strengthen their productive capacities and empower them to participate in decision-making .  
Aid programmes are intended to consolidate the new constitutional system , as well as social programmes , the development of technical assistance projects , the supply of equipment , human resources development , strengthening of the productive sectors , improvement of the environment , conservation of natural resources and the modernization of public administration .  
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
It indicated that in current circumstances Iraq would be unable to export oil and petroleum products in sufficient quantities to realize the total sum established for phase IV under resolution 1154 ( 1998 ) because of the limited productive capacity of the oil sector and the sharp fall there had been in oil prices in world markets . 
The Social Summits commitment 3 , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 stated that the heads of State and Government committed themselves to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , and to enabling all men and women to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work .  
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .

Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
It is now a fully functioning international criminal court , holding regular hearings , with a normative framework completed and in operation and close and productive working relationships developed with international organizations working in the former Yugoslavia .

The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration .

At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,

On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
Thus , as was so well pointed out by the Economic and Social Council during its substantive session in 1999 , the international community has a deciding role to play in supporting action to eliminate poverty , promote productive employment , achieve gender equality and mobilize new and additional financial resources in order to guarantee the implementation of the agreed objectives of social development .  
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .

In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
Science and technology are advancing with each passing day , productive forces have developed to an unprecedented high level and the search for social progress and the development of civilization have become irresistible historical trends .  
The third challenge is to build the base of a modern social policy focused on increasing the productive capacities of people and on satisfying their basic needs , thus achieving social integration .  
Both countries sustained heavy losses of human life and much of their infrastructure and productive economic base have been destroyed , casting more doubts upon the future prospects of these countries to address structural poverty and underdevelopment .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .

The major objective of SARD is to enhance food security ( defined as access to the food required for a healthy and productive life ) in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management .  
We feel that this constructive , pedagogical and united approach , built entirely around the central objective of the full international isolation of Jonas Savimbi and UNITA , will ultimately prove far more productive than a repressive one .  
We consider universal access to basic education and a substantial improvement in its quality to be the pillars of our commitment to social development and a fundamental basis for productive human development and democracy .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
Policy and institutional reforms to create a sound socioeconomic and political environment to transform the social and productive basis for development into one in which sustainable , equitable and genderbalanced development can take place .

The Conference needs to focus on finding solutions to the inherent problem of weak productive capacities in LDCs through improved domestic policy frameworks , human capital development , traderelated capacity building and improved physical infrastructure .  
The three Es competitive economy , sound environment and productive employmentare not isolated targets , but interrelated parts that require a combined approach to achieve sustainable industrial development .  
It also imposed harsh restrictions that prevented the population living under occupation from farming and benefiting from its agricultural land , and destroyed mature , productive trees .  
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
The representative of Ethiopia , speaking on behalf of the African Group , stressed the complex and daunting development challenges facing the LDCs and argued that the resolution of such challenges required a multi-dimensional approach encompassing increased development aid and outright debt cancellation , enhanced productive capacity and reduced supply constraints , improved market access , and a mutually supportive domestic and international policy environment .  
A coherent SME policy framework is an essential component of a private sector development strategy where the primary objective is to create productive employment and foster equitable development .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
The objective of actions by LDCs and their development partners is to provide a reliable physical infrastructure , which is essential for efficient operation of existing productive assets and enterprises , attracting new investment , and assuring meaningful economic development .  
Special emphasis on LDCs and assistance in the progressive integration in the global economy by upgrading competitiveness , enhancing productive capacity , stimulating innovations and increasing the level of incomes through a process of industrialization that is compatible with sustainable development ;

In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .

With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
We are convinced that the United Nations system is uniquely placed to play a key role in supporting Africas efforts and to help create a momentum for a productive and mutually beneficial partnership between Africa and the international community and civil society , including the private sector .  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
In 43 countries , integrated programmes address poverty alleviation through industrial development by improving industrial governance and institutional infrastructure , strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises , upgrading technological capacities , skills and access to modern technology , export and trade capabilities , and adopting energy efficient and cleaner productive measures .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
The development of a coherent , national , regional and international transport network combined with efficient transport services are essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
On their part , the debtor least developed countries will aim at maximizing benefits from debt relief by creating a conducive national framework including fiscal reforms , a budgetary framework , sectoral adjustments , contributing to poverty eradication and faster economic growth , export growth , increased investment , enhanced productive capacities , employment and productivity , savings and international competitiveness .

The development of a coherent , national , regional and international transport network , combined with efficient transport services , are essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
The studies point out that development of a coherent rural , national and international transport network is essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Reaffirms the commitments made by heads of State and Government at the World Summit for Social Development , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 and the Programme of Action , 2 which established a new consensus to place people at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development and pledged to eradicate poverty , promote full and productive employment and foster social integration so as to achieve stable , safe and just societies for all ;

Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through the enhancement of agro-based industries , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming and effective and efficient management systems ,  
Implementation of small-scale productive activities , determined and designed by participating institutions , to provide people living in poverty in environmentally sensitive areas with opportunities for income generation through sustainable utilization of local resources .  
Taking measures to enhance a conducive national policy framework that contributes effectively to poverty eradication and promotes faster economic growth , including fiscal reforms , establishment of a medium-term budgetary framework , sectoral adjustments , faster export growth and increasing investment , productive capacities , employment and productivity , savings and international competitiveness ;  
Thereby , setting up a scientific and reasonable taxation structure and standardizing tax collection policies are of extremely important significance to accurately and effectively regulating the re-distribution of national income , promoting the distribution of essential productive factors , directing the optimum distribution of resources , increasing employment opportunities , and facilitating the sustained and sound development of the economy .  
So long as our party always acts as the faithful representative of the demands of the development of the advanced social productive forces in the China , the direction of the development of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party will forever be in an invincible position , and will forever have the heartfelt support of the people of all ethnic groups of the country and continuously lead them forward .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
So long as our party can always remain the loyal representative of the development demands of China 's advanced productive forces in society , the progress orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our party can forever put itself in an invincible position , can forever win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can lead the people to make constant progresses .  
Once we have advanced productive forces and an advanced social system , we can create more and better material and spiritual wealth ; can get a firm foothold , and can march at the head in our competition with different countries and different forces ; and can develop greater power to enhance the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .  
He said : In future , we will further arm the entire party with Deng Xiaoping Theory so that our party will always meet the requirements for the development of the advanced social productive forces , march in the direction toward an advanced culture , be the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the Chinese people , lead the entire country and people to cope with various difficulties and challenges , and victoriously stride into the 21st century .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
Hu Jintao emphasized that the key to seizing and using well the opportunity of the great development of the west to speed up economic and social development lies in doing a good job in building the party organizations at all levels ; in particular , the leading cadres at all levels must play a model role , firmly advance in the forefront of emancipating and developing the productive forces and promoting the building of the two civilizations , and unite and lead the masses to work hard together .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the ï¿½t hree represents .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have worked to sum up historical experience , to carry out reform and opening , to concentrate on economic construction , thereby generating unprecedented development of the productive forces , tremendous improvement in comprehensive national capability , marked improvement in people 's lives , and comprehensive social progress .  
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
Deputy Huang Qifan said : To act as the representative of the advanced productive forces and to be the direction of an advanced culture , it is necessary to continuously forge ahead and perform new meritorious deeds , concentrate our energies on the economic development and the building of spiritual civilization , and accomplish comprehensive and harmonious social development .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
Since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was launched , our party has asserted , in accordance with the theory on China being on the initial stage of socialism , that liberating and developing the productive forces is the essential demand and fundamental task of socialism and proceeded to formulate its own basic line , basic program , and a set of principles and policies , with the stress on unwavering adherence to the party 's basic line , focusing on unwavering adherence to economic construction being the center of all endeavors .  
However , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Under the new historical conditions , through summing up the historical experiences since the founding of the party , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a new , comprehensive , and complete epitome of the advanced nature of the party .  During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
In other words , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but is historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
As long as our party always becomes the faithful representative of the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China our party can always establish itself in an unassailable position , always enjoy the heartfelt support of the people of all nationalities in the whole country , and lead the people to constantly forge ahead .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people are closely interrelated and can embody the essential needs of socialism .  Of these three , the overriding one is representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .  
When inspecting in Guangdong , General Secretary Jiang Zemin noted : Our Party can always stand in a position of permanent victory , receive wholehearted support from all the people nationwide and lead them to march on unceasingly , provided that our Party all along represents the development requirements from the advanced social productive forces in China , represents the development of Chinese advanced culture and represents the essential interests of the overwhelming majority of Chinese people .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
So long as our party can loyally represent at all times the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party can always remain at an invincible position , can always win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can lead the people to forge forward on a constant basis . "  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
Today , by stressing that our party should always represent the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , Comrade Jiang Zemin has upheld and further elaborated , under the present new situation , the most fundamental realistic foundation and philosophical prerequisite of the party-building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
The advancedness of our party is rooted in the historical position of China 's working class which represents the development demands of the social productive forces of our time ; and which is tempered , cultivated , and formed in the protracted struggle .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
So long as it always becomes a loyal representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces , the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
While inspecting Guangdong Province in February of this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that , " Only if our Party is from start to finish the developmental requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of advance of China 's advanced culture , and the faithful representative of the basic interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , only then can our Party forever occupy an invincible position , always obtain the wholehearted support of all the people of this nation , and continually lead the people forward . "  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
To really practice Marxism , it is imperative to meet the requirements of the " three represents " that Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward recently , that is , our party should always represent the development needs of the China 's advance social productive forces , the onward direction of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the largest number of the Chinese people .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
Recently , Comrade Jiang Zemin stated that our party must always be the loyal representative that meets the requirements for development of advanced social productive forces of China , that is in line with the development trend of China 's advanced culture , and that is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people .  
During the 10-year calamity , our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of " developing social productive forces " ; as a result , the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
The standard of our productive forces has risen substantially ; we have further gained comprehensive national strength , and the people as a whole have attained a comfortable standard of living .  
It has accurately epitomized and given a high appraisal to the following three major changes in history .  Namely , the productive forces have been greatly intensified , and the people have generally attained a moderately high standard of living .  Also , three major changes have taken place in social and economic activities in market supply and demand , in institutional environment in economic development , and in economic relations with foreign countries .  
Liu : First of all , we must ascertain that development is the main theme .  We are faced with the political pressure of international hegemonism , the pressure from the developed countries with their superiority in high technology , and our arduous tasks in China 's modernization drive .  Only by greatly raising our productive forces , can we build a material foundation to solve all kinds of social problems .  
From ancient wars through cold-weapon wars and hot-weapon wars to modern mechanized wars and high-tech wars , what weapons to use when a country goes to war is not determined by the subjective will of man , but by the level of productive forces prevailing at the time .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
All this does not tally with the guideline set by the 15th National CPC Congress . To give private enterprises equal treatment is not an expedient measure under the condition of underdeveloped productive forces .  It is a long-term policy for at least 100 years required by our basic system during the initial stage of socialism .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .  " I 'm involved with you and you with me , " and this becomes a powerful , material force restraining world war .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
NPC deputy Zhan Zhongfu cited an example : Take " representing China 's advanced social productive forces " ; how could we speed up development during the Ninth FYP , when we faced the main trend of economic globalization , the rapid development of the revolution in science and technology , and fierce international competition ?  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must persevere in orienting ourselves to the market without wavering at all and ceaselessly eliminate the institutional impediments to the development of productive forces and improve the socialist market economy so as to provide a mighty driving force and institutional guarantee for national economic and social development .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
To keep alive its advanced nature , our party should concentrate on developing the social productive forces , closely follow the major trend of development in the world in terms of science and technology and economy , take economic construction as the center , combine the advanced trends in the knowledge economy , science and technology progress , and social development in an organic way , and strive to serve well as the representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
When new China was established , for historical reasons the mother mainland laid particular stress on putting politics in command and emphasized ideology ; it violated the laws of economic development , and in particular this went to extremes during the " 10-year cultural revolution , " causing great damage to the social productive forces and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy . 
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
At another Senate hearing held the other day , James Kelly , US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , also said : On issues ranging from advocating peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula to non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and to trade , we have shared interests with China , and a productive and positive relationship is bound to benefit the United States most .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
Economically , the relationship of production characterized by the monopoly of the three major estate-holders was abolished , and ownership by individual farmers and herdsmen was established .  The vast number of former serfs and slaves began to possess their own land , sheep , cattle , and means of production .  This greatly aroused their initiative for production and emancipated the productive forces .  
Special efforts should be made to guide the vast number of demobilized cadres to consciously study and implement the important thinking of " three represents " and transform the requirement on communist party members to represent the advanced social productive forces and advanced culture into concrete deeds of subordinating themselves to the vital and overall interest , accepting the arrangement of the party organization , and taking the needs of the party cause into consideration .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The CPC , which had captured victory nationwide , was faced with a daunting challenge : Can it create advanced productive forces on the basis of old China , where poverty and backwardness had been endemic , and raise the living standard of the masses ?  " A serious economic construction task confronts us . "  
History fully shows that the CPC , which all along represents the development requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , represents the advancing direction of China 's advanced culture , and represents the fundamental interests of the broadest Chinese people , is worthy of the title of a great , glorious , and correct party .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
We must stick with the national strategy of making the country prosperous through science and technology implementation and targeting continuous development , making efforts to learn , master , and apply cutting edge science and technology to achieve breakthroughs in social productive forces for China on the foundation of technology advancement , and we must continuously improve China 's overall national capacity and international competitiveness .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
It must closely follow the trend of development and progress in the world , always represent the requirement for the development of the advanced productive forces in China , the direction for the advancement of advanced culture , and the basic interests of the broad masses of people , and resolutely resolve prominent problems in the party .  The starting point and the focus of attention of my putting forward the requirement for persisting in ' three represents ' lie here . "  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
Reviewing the course of struggle and the basic experience over the past 80 years and looking into the arduous tasks and bright future in the new century , our party should continue to stand in the forefront of the times and lead the people in marching from victory to victory .  In a word , we must always represent the development needs of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practicable steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by our party was to abrogate the imperialist privileges in China , eliminate exploitation and oppression by the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class , change the comprador feudal production relations and the rotten political superstructure built on such an economic base , establish a new political superstructure with the people 's democratic dictatorship as the core and fundamentally emancipate the fettered productive forces .  
Over the past 20-plus years , we have conducted bold explorations and practices and pushed forward the reforms in economic and political structures and other areas and greatly emancipated and developed China 's social productive forces , thereby bringing about tremendous changes in national economic development and social progress .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
Participating comrades held : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech reiterated that the working class is the representative of China 's advanced productive forces and our party should always adhere to the fundamental guiding principle of wholehearted reliance on the working class .  This is a tremendous encouragement and spur to the Chinese working class .  
It is implementing the reform and opening up policy that spurred the national economy to develop in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner and raised the social and productive forces , overall national strength and people 's standard of living to higher levels .  
General secretary of CPC Jiang Zemin pointed out at the meeting that " science and technology is the primary productive force as well an intensified representation and major symbol of the advanced productive force . "  Therefore , we must sharply capture the objective trend , advocate the " two bombs and one satellite " spirit carried on by the old generations of science and technology workers , never giving up pursuing the summit of science and technology .  
Summing up the course of endeavor and basic experiences over 80 years , and looking to the arduous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must - - in sum - - always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
To constantly develop advanced productive forces and culture is , in the final analysis , aimed at meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and continuously realizing the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people . "  
As long as our party always faithfully represents the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces , the advance development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever , win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout China forever , and lead the people to forge ahead ceaselessly .  
To promote productive forces under the national condition that ours is a big and populous country with scarce farmland and a weak economic foundation , we must keep strict control over population growth , and must work hard to improve the population quality .  
We have seen clearly that the poor level of productive forces is a major factor that determines people 's willingness in having children .  In view of this , China has worked out its population program and population policies that conform with reality , which have not only successfully ensured healthy development for the country 's population and family planning undertaking ; but has also served to promote the country 's economic growth , push forward social progress , improve the living standards of the people , and enhance the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
In light of the ongoing " three stresses " education activities , Chen Gang , chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the Dongbei Pharmaceutical Group , said : In the past few years , the Pharmaceutical Group , proceeding from the requirement of representing advanced social productive forces , renovated its structure and management and accelerated the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  In this way , the company was able to re-emerge from the brink of bankruptcy and to return to the road of rapid growth .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
We must accord full importance to the functions and role of public finance , implement a correct fiscal policy , and readjust and optimize the composition of outlays in a timely way in order to better serve the development of advanced productive forces and the promotion of the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
After the establishment of New China , China 's athletic project has developed rapidly .  Particularly during the 20 years since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy , China 's national economy has developed in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner ; the social and productive forces , the overall national strength , people 's life and the athletic level have been greatly improved .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that " as long as our Party always represents the requirements of the development of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our Party will be in an invincible position , will always receive the great support of the people of every ethnic group across the country and will lead the people in continuously pressing ahead . "  
These units have also provided many good farming and breeding skills for Tibet residents without compensation .  These years , they have changed their assistance steps and methods in a timely manner .  They have depended on their farms and production bases and exploited their professional , technological , and equipment advantages to translate many research achievements into social productive forces , thus greatly promoting the development of society , the economy , and productive forces of Tibet as well as the improvement of people 's living standards .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market . 
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
in terms of new development , the important concept of " three represents " has enriched and developed the Marxist theory of political parties , classes , and the masses according to the fundamental tenets of Marxism on the relationship between the productive forces and production and between the economic base and the superstructure , by keeping the new century in mind , and by proceeding from the laws of social development and the basic nature of the party ;  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .  One of the basic needs for us to " represent the requirements of the development of advanced productive forces " is to quicken railway development and to strive to change the current insufficient capacity of railway transportation as soon as possible .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
Both sides have seen continuous high-level exchanges , rapid development in trade relations , ever expanding economic and technological cooperation , and productive exchanges in cultural , sports , and other areas .  The forum plans to officially set up a trade representative office in China this year .  
create a sound social order environment for economic development ; and protect and promote the development of the advanced productive forces .  We must resolutely wipe out the ugly social phenomena , such as pornography , gambling , and narcotics ; strengthen management of cultural entertainment places and cultural markets ; firmly crack down on illegal and criminal activities using feudal superstition and religion ; enhance people 's sense of the legal system and ethics ;  
3 .  The " speech " uses the " three represents " important idea to sums up history , analyze reality , and look into the future ; reveals the scientific connotation of representing the requirement of the development of the advanced productive forces , the orientation of the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , as well as their inherent relationships ; and uses the " three represents " as a guideline to put forward the basic tasks of stepping up and improving party building .  
According to experts , China has an ample supply of resources and a surplus of productive capacity .  A buyers ' market is taking shape and there is substantial material guarantee .  An increase in fiscal deficits and government debts can arouse the hidden production factors and stimulate economic growth .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

In the more than 50 years since the founding of New China , especially in the 20-odd years since the start of reform and opening up , our country 's productive forces have developed rapidly , our overall national strength has noticeably increased , the people 's living standards have generally improved , the unity of nationalities has been continuously strengthened , social stability has prevailed , our country 's international prestige has steadily grown , and China has now become one of the countries which have developed fastest in the world .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
refines and summarizes anew the Marxist points on the communist party 's advanced nature ; unveils the substance and implication of the communist party 's advanced nature from the high plane of the law of social development as well as the communist party 's intrinsic progressive quality .  In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .  
Science and technology in ancient China produced some stellar results , but there were some inadequacies , mainly in that no tradition of experimental science was formed and there was no system of academic disciplines .  Science and technology did not gain the social status that it needed , and the impetus and mechanisms by which science and technology could advance the development of the social productive forces were lacking .  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Reportedly , during his inspection tour to the south last February , Jiang Zemin pointed out the need to keep the CPC " a faithful representative of the requirements in the development of advanced productive forces in China , the orientation of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China . " This was later called the " three represents . "  As it was not a " comprehensive exposition , " it was not noticed at that time .  
We must - - from the high planes of promoting the development of the social productive forces , advancing the development of the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " three represents " - - seize the opportunity and take advantage of the favorable situation to forge ahead and spare no effort in creating a new situation in anti-narcotics work to make fresh , even greater contributions to completely prohibiting narcotics .  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
He emphatically pointed out : His thesis that our party should " always be a requirement in the development of advanced productive force in China - - - - a faithful representative of the fundamental interest of the greatest majority of the Chinese people " means that such a historic mission should be carried out as a dynamic historical process .  
Li Chongfu believes that " always be " and " faithful representative " mean that the party 's line , principles and policies and its overall political guidance formulated and implemented during any time must be adapted to the situation of that time and to local conditions , and they must reflect the law and requirements of the development of productive forces , reflect the wish of the working masses , and be able to promote the development of productive forces and the social progress .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
integrated reform efforts , development speed , and social capacity for acceptance ; and formulated a series of principles and policies on developing the productive forces .  We should seize opportunities and advance in an enterprising spirit so as to secure a new great victory in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization .  
When we interviewed some party 's theoretical workers in the capital and other places , they all expressed the same understanding with different languages , pointing out that history and the people have chosen the CPC because it represents the advanced social productive forces , the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the great majority of the people since it was founded . 
We should throw into the garbage heap all the ideas and actions that run counter to the " three represents , " as well as all the feudal , superstitious , and unhealthy bourgeois ideas that have corroded our party organizations and party members , but we should uphold all the statements and actions that are capable of promoting the development of productive forces , conducive to heightening the advanced cultural level , and tallying with the people 's immediate and long-term interests .  
In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .  
In particular , the implementation of measures designed to exercise aggregate control , readjust the economic structure , close down " five kinds of small enterprises , " and eliminate the backward productive capacity has played an important role in pushing for a rebound in industrial efficiency .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
In economic restructuring , there have been marked improvements in the aggregate control of some surplus and obsolete productive capacities and products , such as the textile , coal , metallurgical industries , and the electronic information industry is becoming a new impetus to economic growth .  
In the meantime , we should strengthen law enforcement and prosecute according to law those engaged in illegal productive activities such as unauthorized extraction of minerals , excessive pumping of underground water , and indiscriminate construction , which bring on geological disasters causing enormous losses .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : We should persistently carry out reform to innovate relevant systems , perfect the socialist market economy system , and make the production relations and the superstructure meet the needs of the constantly developing productive forces and economic base .  
In his final days , he wrote " Politics and Economics Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat " and other articles , despite his illness , to explain the basic theory of Marxism and put forward a series of important ideas and viewpoints on strengthening relations between the party and the people , developing the social productive force and exploring the correct ways for China 's socialist construction .  
The rapid progress of science and technology in the world , especially the development of information technology , has created new and broad prospects for the development of the productive force and the society .  It is creating a profound influence on political , economic , military , science and technology , culture and social fields of various countries .  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
Under the system of multiparty cooperation led by the CPC , the democratic parties unite and cooperate with the ruling party in exerting for the cause of building socialism .  Together , they have created a stable environment for liberating and developing the productive forces and maintaining the sustainable development of the economy , thus enabling China to make achievements of world interest in economic construction .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .  
In holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory and sticking unwaveringly to the basic line of the Party , the most important thing is insisting on economic development as the center , concentrating our efforts and being unwavering in our development of the social productive forces .  
In the new century , we must vigorously promote progress and innovation in science and technology in China , getting science and technology to play a major role as the first productive force , continually providing a powerful motive force for China 's economic and social development and enabling China to achieve new and greater development in the intense international competition of the future .  
According to the source , the CPC holds that while in the process of " speeding up " industrialization , China is facing the rare opportunities of the extensive application of achievements in the scientific and technological revolution , the massive transformation of information technology , and the large-scale upgrading of traditional industries .  Hence , it must spur industrialization with informationization , give play to its advantage in " gaining the initiative by surpassing the early starters , " and strive to catch up from behind and realize the rapid development of the social productive forces .  
The highly effective application of aerospace technology in the fields of telecommunications , broadcast , meteorology , resources , satellite navigation and orientation , and so on has brought about tremendous changes in human productive forces and lifestyles and pushed forward economic development and social progress .  
The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .  
During this period , it was the " spring of science , " in which science and technology , as the primary productive forces , were more and more closely integrated with the economic construction .  In particular , with the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and technology being defined as the basic national policy , acceleration of scientific and technological progress was placed in an important position of economic and social development .  
As the primary productive forces , science and technology are growing and expanding rapidly in the fields ranging from synthetic insulin to the cultivation of hybrid rice high-yield variety , and from human genome plan to the basic research and development of nanometer technologies , and the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress to the national economic growth has rapidly risen to nearly 40 percent .  
Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
To persevere in scientific and technological innovation , we must transform the scientific and technological potentialities into practical productive forces , enable it to become the primary driving force for economic and social development , create a favorable environment for innovation , carry out in-depth scientific and educational reforms , and make great effort to encourage innovation ;  
During his inspection tour of Guangdong , he particularly emphasized again that as long as our party always faithfully represents the development needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of China 's advanced cultural progress , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the Chinese people , our party will always be invincible , always win the sincere support of the people of various ethnic groups across the country , and always lead the people in their advances .  
As China 's only agricultural high-technology industrial demonstration zone , Yangling should study and apply well the important ideology on " three represents , " really regard the development requirements for advanced productive forces , the orientation of advancement of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest number of people as the criteria for teaching , scientific research , technological development and all fields of work , and build the Yangling demonstration zone into a first-grade agricultural base for agricultural scientific research and technological development at home and abroad . .  
pay close attention to the tests facing party building under complicated domestic and foreign situations , carry out in-depth study of outstanding problems existing within the party , and earnestly solve them according to the important ideas of the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " ;  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the social productive forces in our country have continuously developed , our comprehensive national strength has greatly increased , the people 's living standards have noticeably improved , and our country 's international standing has risen day by day .  
The important purpose of systemic innovation is to overcome the factors in the relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the development of the productive forces and to keep liberating and developing the productive forces .  We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
This " give-and-take " strategic readjustment became the mainline of the " Eighth Five-year Plan , " and during the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , this was combined with the overall readjustment of the setup of the municipality 's productive forces to promote the continuous " upgrading " of the standard and the quality of the secondary and tertiary industries .  
Wen Jiabao says after more than 20 years , China 's rural reform has achieved huge success .  Agriculture 's comprehensive productive capacity has scaled one height after another ; the peasants ' living standard has clearly improved , and the outlook of the rural society has undergone dramatic changes .  
Economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , and is the new height and stage of this development , in which resources and social production factors are allocated in the most effective way on a global scale .  It represents the most advanced production mode and productive force hitherto seen in human society and will become the economic base of world peace , universal harmony , and the future new society of mankind .  
In measuring China 's political system and political party system , the fundamental point is to proceed from China 's national conditions and from the actual results of China 's revolution , construction , and reform .  First , we must see whether the system can promote the sustained development of the social productive forces and comprehensive social progress .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
They highly praised the brilliant achievements scored in China under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , and felt elated and inspired by the sustained development of social productive forces , the continuously elevated standards of the people 's material and cultural lives , the gradual advance of the socialist democratic politics , and the excellent situation of national unity , national unification , and social stability .  
The party at large must center on this topic , conduct investigations and studies , reach a consensus , and respond by taking into full account changes in the international and domestic situations , growth of our country 's productive forces and profound transformations of the economic system , calls for the development of the material and cultural life of the masses , and major changes in the contingent of party members and cadres .  
Therefore , not only must we not engage in low-standard , blind , and redundant constructions , but we must also eliminate backward productive capability to form the mechanism that allows the superior to eliminate the inferior and in turn achieve vertical elevation of the economy 's overall quality .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
If we are unable to achieve breakthroughs in the progress of agricultural science and technology , it will be hard to enhance the comprehensive productive forces in agriculture and agricultural competitiveness , and it will then be hard to meet the demands of all-round building of a comfortably well-off living standard .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
The ninth five-year plan was smoothly completed ; social productive forces and comprehensive national strength have risen to a new level ;  
The new technological revolution , represented by information technology , biotechnology , and nanometer technology , is now profoundly changing the traditional economic structure , production organization , and operational modes and is bringing about a leap in the quality of the development of productive forces .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
We stress the importance of unleashing and developing productive forces and building an advanced culture , but the purpose of all this is , in the final analysis , to realize , develop , and safeguard the people 's interests and continuously meet the ever-increasing material and cultural demands of the general public .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
Faced with the new situation and tasks during the 10th FYP , in order to achieve the development goals for the new century , it is essential to continue to persist in emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , speed up the pace of system reforms and innovation , continually remove system-style obstacles constraining the development of the social productive forces , and further perfect the socialist market economy system , so as to create a still more favorable system environment and conditions for economic development .  
In line with the principle of getting some things done and leaving others alone , Zhejiang should grasp a number of key technologies and common technologies related to the overall situation of economic development to make breakthroughs at key points , pay particular attention to converting the fruits of science and technology into modern productive forces , continue to develop hi-tech industries , and devote efforts to speeding up the application of high technology and advanced applied technology to revamp traditional industries , so as to promote still faster and better development of Zhejiang 's economy .  
President Jiang Pointed out : Through more than two decades of development , our country has initially built a socialist market economic system , formed the pattern of opening to the outside world in all directions , gained valuable experiences in controlling complicated situations and coping with various risks , and made a marked advance in increasing the productive forces and the comprehensive national strength ; the self-confidence and cohesion of the people of various nationalities across the country have been continuously strengthened .  All this has laid a solid foundation for our continuing advance .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
Now , we have drawn a lesson from our painful experience .  The new round of industrial revolution in today 's world , like a tidal wave , is not only posing a grim challenge to us , but also providing us with a historical opportunity whereby we can catch up with the new revolution in science and technology and achieve leap-forward development of the productive forces .  
In the coming five years , it is imperative to unswervingly carry forward reform , open the country wider to the outside world , remove structural barriers hamstringing the development of productive forces , and provide economic development with a powerful dynamic force .  
On fiscal policy , Mr Kwong said : " Our sound financial position depends largely on our strict discipline in controlling expenditure and our efforts in maintaining a stable and productive revenue base .  
Notwithstanding the sharp currency depreciation in the region , the price competitiveness of Hong Kong 's exports was preserved to a considerable extent by the continued downward adjustment in export prices , moderating domestic inflation , and upgrading of productive efficiency and product quality . 
" To maintain our US / HK dollar link , we have an effective currency board system backed by the third largest foreign reserves in the world , a high savings rate , a strong fiscal position with no government foreign debt , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent , flexible , labour force and first-class infrastructure . "  
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
Members are aware that in the 1998 / 99 Budget I announced last February and in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address last October , a wide range of measures to enhance Hong Kong 's productive capacity and competitive edge were set out .  They underline our resolve to seek greater achievements in science and technology , industrial innovation , infrastructure , development of human resources and efficiency and cost effectiveness of the government .  
He also considered that the most productive focus for international and national economic reforms lay in the four key areas of strengthening financial markets , reducing vulnerability to short term capital flows , promoting greater transparency at all levels , and involving private creditors in debt resolution arrangements .  
" Any proposed new taxes would need to meet the criteria of being revenue productive on a recurrent basis , with revenue productivity largely immune to economic cycles and the impact of e-commence , cost effective to administer , simple to comply with and , of course , equitable , " he said . 
Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
The general planning intention of the area is to conserve the intrinsic natural character of the scenic hilly landscape on the western and northern parts , to promote recreation and productive agriculture on the valley floors , to upgrade the obsolete and sub-standard housing in the central and southern parts , and to maintain the character and intensity of the residential developments in the area .  
This great tradition is seen in the annual increase in the number of overseas Chinese visitors , their augmented investment in productive enterprises here , their insistent and courageous resistance to Chinese Communist united front temptations , and especially in their active moral and physical support of the government in their motherland during the last two months . "  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
" the goal of this revolution is to further liberate and develop the productive forces , and to turn our underdeveloped socialist country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced and modern socialist country , and that will demonstrate the superiority of socialism in china , " jiang said  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) has been impeded by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , mainly at the local level , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
Develop economic policies to mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Much productive work of great social importance is not remunerated , such as caring for children and the elderly , protecting the environment and providing voluntary assistance to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups .  
The causes of poverty were varied and complex , and to alleviate it would require increasing domestic saving , investing in productive sectors , diversifying the economy and creating a favourable international economic environment .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
The poverty alleviation programme aims to enable every Malawian to have access to basic necessities and to be able to develop and exploit his or her full potential to lead a productive , dignified and creative life through social , economic and political empowerment .  
Our Government is fully convinced that if we are to enjoy sustained medium - and long-term growth it must be based on an efficient and competitive productive sector , both domestically and internationally , and to that end we have adopted the requisite economic policy measures .  
We consider that implementation of the Programme of Action is urgent , with a view to establishing a framework for economic growth and sustainable development , and a national and international climate favourable to social development , to the elimination of poverty , to increasing productive employment , to reducing unemployment and to fostering social integration .  
These would include creating and reviving national institutions , rebuilding and expanding the infrastructure , revitalizing the economy and creating and expanding social services , so that the Palestinian people may re-emerge as a proud , productive , independent , sovereign nation , with its own flag flying over all its territory , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , and with full status as a Member State of the United Nations .  
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Deeply concerned about the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to education , training and literacy programmes ,  
Develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Actions are recommended to create , in a framework of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a national and international environment favourable to social development , to eradicate poverty , to enhance productive employment and reduce unemployment , and to foster social integration .  
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Economic opportunities for rural women should be improved through elimination of legal , social , cultural and practical obstacles to women 's participation in economic activities and ensuring that women have equal access to productive resources .  
Efforts are needed to acknowledge the social and economic importance and value of unremunerated work and to facilitate labour force participation in combination with such work through flexible working arrangements , encouraging voluntary social activities as well as broadening the very conception of productive work and to accord social recognition for such work [ including , by reflecting its value in the satellite accounts of the gross national product ] .  
Pursuing the coordination of macroeconomic policies so that they are mutually reinforcing and conducive to broad-based and sustained economic growth and sustainable development , as well as substantial increases in productive employment expansion and a decline in unemployment worldwide ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
A productive agriculture is an essential prerequisite of SARD , with its multiple objectives of reducing poverty and improving livelihoods while conserving and protecting the natural resource base .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
The report recommended four main areas of future focus at the macro level : advising on social objectives and the efficient handling of the economy ; creating productive employment ; revamping the agriculture sector ; and strengthening the national database to measure social progress .  
Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal and more equitable access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
Deeply concerned by the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to training and literacy programmes ,  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Initially created to foster the economic empowerment of women in the developing world by improving their access to credit , productive resources , training and opportunities for income - generation , the Fund 's scope of work over the last two decades has expanded to include the promotion of women 's social and political empowerment .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
The World Summit for Social Development was remarkable in its scope : it gave a comprehensive meaning to social development , encompassing the functioning of society and all institutions for the overall objective of the betterment of the human condition and it placed people at the centre of all concerns and policies for sustainable development , proclaiming that all human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with the environment .  
The unique character of the Congress , in which the participants combined political leverage and expertise , and which served as a forum for the world-wide sharing of knowledge , exchange of experience and transfer of technological know-how , has been widely recognized , and its productive results were emphasized both at the Congress and at the Commission 's subsequent session . 
Discrimination in education and training , hiring and remuneration , promotion and horizontal mobility practices , as well as inflexible working conditions , lack of access to productive resources and inadequate sharing of family responsibilities , combined with a lack of or insufficient services such as child care , continue to restrict employment , economic , professional and other opportunities and mobility for women and make their involvement stressful .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services ;  
While stabilization policies of demand restraint are designed to put a floor under a downward spiral in key economic indicators and are critical for the resumption of growth , long-term sustained economic development requires an improvement in the economy 's productive capacity that can only be accomplished by active policies on the supply side . 
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
While stabilization policies of demand restraint are designed to put a floor under a downward spiral in key economic indicators and are critical for the resumption of growth , long-term sustained economic development requires an improvement in the economy 's productive capacity that can only be accomplished by active policies on the supply side . 
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) was hampered by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
it was the economic and social marginalization of poor countries which deprived children of the right to realize their physical and intellectual potential , complete their education , find work and become well-adjusted , economically productive and socially responsible adults .  
In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
The human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge of our time and a serious threat to humanity .  The socio-economic consequences of the disease are a matter of grave concern , and the international community should make concerted efforts to address this human tragedy which affects the young and the productive sectors of our societies in particular before it is too late .  
In response to our d \ x { 5e66 } arche , the Secretary-General informed us that he had submitted to the executive heads of the specialized agencies a series of proposals for the establishment of inter-agency task forces aimed at providing strong coordinated support for country-level action , in the areas of the extension of basic social services , access by the poor to productive assets and employment and the creation of an enabling environment for poverty eradication and social development . 
The Government has formulated specific and concrete plans aimed at modernizing the productive structures of the country , in order to legitimize a new economic plan through genuine proposals for social development , based on the concept of social solidarity and good governance .  
At the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen our Heads of State and Government committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty , expanding productive sectors , creating employment , and creating a favourable and enabling environment for world economic recovery and growth through decisive international and national action .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
Given the progress made to date , we can not forget that we must move towards prohibiting and completely eliminating this kind of weapon , because of its mass , indiscriminate and devastating effects , its long-term threat , its tragic human consequences and its widespread hindrance of the productive use of broad areas , particularly affecting those most in need and seriously jeopardizing the living conditions of many peoples .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to provide Nicaragua , at the request of its Government , with all possible assistance to support the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development in such areas as caring for displaced persons , land ownership and land tenure in rural areas , appropriate care for war-disabled persons , mine clearance and the overcoming of difficulties in the restoration of the productive areas of the country , and , in general , a process of sustained economic and social recovery and development so that the peace and democracy already achieved become irreversible ;  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
The Commission may recall that at its fourth session , all delegations and representatives of the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that contributed to the debate on the Ninth Congress expressed their satisfaction with the successful conduct of the proceedings and its productive results , in spite of the fact that the time available for pre-Congress consultations and the Ninth Congress itself had to be shortened , that the venue of the Congress had to be changed , and that all preparatory arrangements had to be completed in only a few months .  
Recognizing the need for effective government and efficient public administrative services to be responsive to the needs of the people , to ensure universal access to quality services and productive assets and to create an enabling environment for sustainable development and provide quality services ,  
The Working Group took note that concerning offshore oil and gas activities , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) had concluded that harmonized environmental regulations had been and were being developed in specific regional programmes , and such discussions were proving productive .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Provide assistance to Governments in support of poverty-alleviation efforts designed to improve the economic status of women , in the framework of national policy and legislation and focusing on productive employment generation and poverty alleviation , working conditions and social protection , skill training schemes , especially with respect to managerial , supervisory and high-level positions , and income-generating activities ; introduce reproductive health and other population components into existing income-generation activities ( ILO , UNFPA , UN / DDSMS ) .  
Recognizing that effectiveness of government requires an efficient and effective public administration in all countries that is responsive to the needs of the people , promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable people-centred development ,  
In summary they are those whose ownership of assets or access to productive resources and whose capacity to participate in new opportunities is so low as to make it difficult for them to have the basic minimum of consumption and services required for a decent life .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
The foreseeable developments in the international context - economic , political and institutional - following the Uruguay Round and the advance of regional and subregional integration agreements can offer some opportunities for countries whose productive and export-driven development has been retarded ; nevertheless , they also entail a significant erosion of the opportunities for implementing selective policies to promote such development .  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
The national and regional development work-sites , which in times of economic difficulty and in the absence of any sustained creation of productive , stable and permanent jobs , as well as in periods of drought , constitute supplementary employment programmes . 
Kenya has had a long and productive association with the AALCC , and it is therefore with pleasure that I address the Assembly on behalf of the Kenya delegation to express our warm thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General and secretariat of the AALCC for their outstanding work in promoting interregional and international cooperation , supportive of the efforts of the United Nations , with a view to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the progressive development and codification of international law as well as in economic and humanitarian matters .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
They also have been asked by many States engaged in democratization to help encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens in political processes , and to foster the emergence of a productive civil society , including responsible and independent communications media .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Responding to this productive mood , and convinced that we could advance the process if we continued , our delegations proposed and the Fourth Committee agreed to defer action on the draft resolution and continue the informal dialogue to tackle the more difficult issues still outstanding .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .  
Strengthened international cooperation and the application of appropriate national policy will also contribute to ensuring a stable environment conducive to promoting social development , including reduction of unemployment and generation of productive employment in developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .  
The process of urbanization facilitates sustainable development by giving more people access to productive and sustainable technologies and reducing pressure on ecologically fragile areas ; but it poses enormous problems for urban planning and management , which must meet the growing demand for energy , water and transportation , while coping with increasing volumes of solid , liquid and gaseous wastes .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons . 
The Parties shall promote the maintenance and development , on a mutually advantageous basis , of productive and scientific and technological cooperation between economic agents , particularly in the development and production of modern goods employing advanced technology , including items for defence needs , through , inter alia , the formulation of comprehensive inter-State and intersectoral cooperation programmes .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
In the United States , the Department of Justice is engaged in an ongoing initiative to establish effective and productive working relationships between the federal Government and state governments and local governmental subdivisions .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
In order to achieve those objectives , it was necessary to establish a modern legal framework in order to protect intellectual property and attract external resources for productive investment and , lastly , to ensure the participation of civil society and the integration of society with a view to harmonious and balanced development .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
The goal of education is to make people wiser , more knowledgeable , better informed , ethical , responsible , critical and capable of continuing to learn , and more productive and creative in the workplace .  
That required an approach to development which valued responsible economic management , respected human rights , affirmed gender equity , assured access to productive assets and met basic human needs .  
The basic idea was to integrate the most disadvantaged population groups into the national economy and to guarantee them equal opportunity for access to basic services , decent housing , productive employment and an adequate standard of living .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
It adopted the Istanbul Declaration , in which the nations present endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more liveable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
Whatever the outcome on public funding arrangements , the essential role of the private sector in the productive , entrepreneurial aspects of sustainable forest management needs to be recognized , reinforced and promoted .  
While stabilization strategy is designed to calm financial and economic turbulence by curbing high inflation rates and curtailing enormous budget deficits in the short term , structural adjustment is aimed at restructuring the productive capacities in order to increase efficiency and help restore growth and , therefore , extends over the medium and long term .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
It would require the support of the international community in order , inter alia to promote full employment as a basic priority of economic and social policies and to encourage the formulation of policies and strategies , at the national and regional level , that would meet the basic needs of the people , strengthen their productive capacities and empower them to participate in decision-making .  
Aid programmes are intended to consolidate the new constitutional system , as well as social programmes , the development of technical assistance projects , the supply of equipment , human resources development , strengthening of the productive sectors , improvement of the environment , conservation of natural resources and the modernization of public administration .  
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
It indicated that in current circumstances Iraq would be unable to export oil and petroleum products in sufficient quantities to realize the total sum established for phase IV under resolution 1154 ( 1998 ) because of the limited productive capacity of the oil sector and the sharp fall there had been in oil prices in world markets . 
The Social Summits commitment 3 , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 stated that the heads of State and Government committed themselves to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , and to enabling all men and women to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work .  
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
I would like in conclusion to express our readiness and sincere desire to work together with all other nations to build a peaceful world in which all people can live happy and productive lives , free from political , social and economic anxieties .  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
We also reaffirm that , as set forth at the Fourth World Conference on Women , we are determined to promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services .  
They include the need for effective demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants into productive civilian life ; post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in stable and secure environments ; reform and capacity-building of police , judicial and penal systems ; and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law , including with regard to the use and transfer of small arms .  
The development of a competitive industry generating productive employment within a healthy environment was the best possible bulwark against poverty and the best means of creating an economically sound global society with minimal risks of economic and social conflict .  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
Finally , the Council agreed that the international community has a key role to play in supporting efforts to eradicate poverty , promote productive employment and achieve gender equality , and that the mobilization of new and additional financial resources from all sources , national and international , is required .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
It is now a fully functioning international criminal court , holding regular hearings , with a normative framework completed and in operation and close and productive working relationships developed with international organizations working in the former Yugoslavia .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
The Government of Jamaica had implemented a national youth policy aimed at giving young people the opportunity to develop their full mental , social , spiritual and physical potential through training programmes to assist youth to be responsible , productive citizens .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,  
Equally important , they must promote and incorporate policies for universal access to basic and primary education , improved literacy , increased life expectancy , reduced infant and maternal mortality rates and the achievement of levels of health that lead to socially and economically productive lives .  
By actively participating in the preparatory process for the special session on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit , my Government would like to contribute to achieving our common goals in fighting poverty , creating productive jobs and making a stable , safe and just society for all .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
Thus , as was so well pointed out by the Economic and Social Council during its substantive session in 1999 , the international community has a deciding role to play in supporting action to eliminate poverty , promote productive employment , achieve gender equality and mobilize new and additional financial resources in order to guarantee the implementation of the agreed objectives of social development .  
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .

The major objective of SARD is to enhance food security ( defined as access to the food required for a healthy and productive life ) in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management .  
We feel that this constructive , pedagogical and united approach , built entirely around the central objective of the full international isolation of Jonas Savimbi and UNITA , will ultimately prove far more productive than a repressive one .  
We consider universal access to basic education and a substantial improvement in its quality to be the pillars of our commitment to social development and a fundamental basis for productive human development and democracy .
