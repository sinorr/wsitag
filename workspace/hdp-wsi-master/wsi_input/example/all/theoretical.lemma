His deeds have reflected the mental outlook of the party 's theoretical workers in the new period and provided profound enlightenment and beneficial lessons for conducting ideological and political work in various military units .  
The book on the " expositions of Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin on Ideological and Political Work " should be regarded as the basic teaching materials , fitted into the theoretical study for party committees at and above the regimental level and into the political education for the PLA units , and included in the political theoretical classes and study of colleges and universities .  The people should be organized to conscientiously study it .  Leading cadres , especially political cadres , should take the lead in studying and understanding these expositions well .  
During the theoretical study , the central study teams of the party committees at all levels of the Navy elaborated the major realistic issues in the Navy 's modernization program and preparations for military struggles to more than 100 specific topics for study and practice .  Focused on these topics , they guided the reading , investigations , research , exchanges , and application of the leading cadres at all levels .  
With Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important expositions and the major policy decisions as the guide , the Navy party committee shared the work among its standing committee members .  Through the activities of inspecting and guiding work at the grassroots units , going to sea on the vessels , working and living with the rank and file , and having heart-to-heart talks with them , the party committee introduced more than 30 theoretical research topics , which included political building , military training , equipment scientific research , and logistics supply for Navy building in the new period .  
Philosophy is an advanced form of theoretical thinking ; and is a fundamental stand , viewpoint , and method used by people for observing , understanding , and guiding both practice and scientific research .  
To our knowledge , these localities , after seriously studying and discussing the central leading comrades ' important speeches , made a further mobilization and set aside more than a week 's time for a concentrated theoretical study .  Following the extensive reading in the preceding stage , they practiced intensive reading , conducted special-subject education , and pondered theories in light of reality .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Xu Zhigong has long been engaged in the work of political theoretical education and research .  Over the years , he has regarded the implementation of Chairman Jiang 's instruction of " arming the people with scientific theories " as his lofty mission , worked with ardent loyalty , studied assiduously , made innovations in a pioneering spirit , and has achieved remarkable results in the teaching and research of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
The publication of this yearbook filled a major void in China 's human rights theoretical building , provided authoritative materials for the international community to understand China 's views on human rights and China 's human rights reality , and provided effective objective facts and theories to refute international hostile forces ' distortion of and attack against China 's human rights conditions .  
In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
This important thinking , with rich content , profound thought and prominent characteristics of the current era , being highly theoretical and practicable , is a new summary of the Party 's nature , of its essential principles and of its historic mission , is a new development in Marxist theory on Party construction and is a new requirement of the Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the new situation .  
In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
For example , some people have laid stress on their professional work while making light of theory .  According to these people , theory is soft and nominal , and it makes no difference how much theoretical knowledge one will master ; whereas professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology is solid and real , and one 's knowledge in this aspect can be measured easily .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
In view of the " shortcomings " and weak points in the building of equipment department , this department vigorously carried out , organized , and directed the training while selecting personnel and grasping professional basic training .  It also cultivated equipment commanders at all levels who have military theoretical accomplishment and macro decision-making awareness , and raised the organizational and planning ability of equipment organs .  
In the drill , on one hand , this department attached prime importance to theoretical study , scientifically analyzed and evaluated the present situation of the theater 's support capacity , especially its own units , and comprehensively grasped the characteristics of the theater 's topography , weather , social situation , popular feelings , and the actual conditions of the equipment and combat readiness , and provided guidance for troops ' practical work .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
The Party Central Committee rallying around Comrade Jiang Zemin raised high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and led forward the entire party and all the peoples of the nation along the road pointed out by Deng Xiaoping Theory , achieving numerous new successes in the building of socialism , while at the same time continuously pursuing theoretical development and innovation based on new experiences and new situations .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
As a result , the troops have achieved the purpose of learning to give self and mutual medical aid on the battle ground ; the exercise has reached a reliable theoretical basis for the troops in grasping and using troop disposition , board and lodging , and fighting and hiding of the squad to reduce to the maximum degree casualties of non-combat personnel for future operations in the lofty mountains and jungles ; and the achievement has filled gaps in the aspect of field survival for troops .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
During the 1950s , along with a high-degree synthetic development from a unitary structure of the Army to a combined structure for all services and arms , including the Navy and the Air Force , and following its coordinated air-ground operations on the battlefield in Korea as well as its preliminary practice of a joint landing operations at Yijiangshan Island , our military started to put on its work schedule the theoretical study of coordinated operations involving all services and arms , and attained major achievements in this aspect .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
All these activities provide rich basic materials for the research of human rights theories , expand the scope of human right theoretical research in China , and have filled up some gaps in the research of human rights in China , enhanced the level of human rights theoretical research , and also provided a benign social environment for the development of human rights theoretical research in China .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Article 4 .  National defense education shall be based on the principle of participation by the whole people , long-term perseverance , and seeking practical results ; the principle of combining regular education with concentrated education , universal education with focused education , and theoretical education with behavioral education should be pursued ; and its implementation should be organized by category , with the contents of education determined according to different recipients of education .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
The basic theories , basic line , and basic program established by the party have provided an important ideological and theoretical weapon for our settlement of these problems ; the constantly enhanced bearing capacity of the vast numbers of masses in society has provided a more favorable social environment for our settlement of these problems ;  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
We should , in accordance with the characteristics of this educational campaign , satisfactorily conduct programs to study , supervise and discuss crucial and specific issues and topics , understand Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " in association with the Marxist theory on Party-building , consider this thinking in accordance with the positive and negative experiences of the CPC and parties of foreign countries , and study this thinking in association with replying and solving the significant theoretical and practical issues we are facing at present .  
We should not only be aware of the significant development and the significant contributions , but also profoundly understand the substantial significance for the practice and the guiding role .  In this way , we can comprehensively and accurately master the ideological and theoretical system and lay down a solid theoretical and ideological foundation for Party members to conscientiously put their advanced nature into practice .  
In line with the work arrangements of the Central Military Commission and the PLA General Political Department , all major units of the PLA have engaged in theoretical studies ; carried out discussions and exchanged experiences ; and have enhanced their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in running well the education activity in close connection with the historical experiences that our party has gained in carrying out its struggle in unity over the past 80 years , and with the complex developments in the present situation of struggle both inside and outside the country .  
These works containing tens of millions of characters have embodied in a concentrated way the two major theoretical achievements of the integration of the Marxist basic tenets with the specific realities in China - - the essence of Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and they are the most precious ideological wealth of the whole party .  
At present , the important " three represents " thinking has become a major topic in the theoretical study of the entire party and a focal point of the " three stresses " education conducted among leading cadres at all levels .  It has also become an important content of our theoretical research and propaganda work conducted by our press circles .  Practicing the " three represents " thinking has become a conscious act of the broad masses of party members and cadres .  
At this moment commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China , we should meticulously study these important expositions , in light of the Party 's glorious history , solve problems by uniting reality with history and combining perspectives with reasoning , genuinely base socialist conviction on a solid ideological and theoretical foundation and transform praises of socialism to a self-mobilized advancement of the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the 21st century .  
The two major theoretical results are the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the party and the people , the valuable spiritual wealth of our party , and the great banner that guides us to advance triumphantly .  
While efforts are made in history researches , attention should also be paid to propaganda , to the collection and sorting-out of raw historical materials , and to theoretical generation and analysis so that the party history work will be raised to a new level .  Second , adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts , adhere to the analytical method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism .  Everything should be based on historical facts , and truth should be sought on the basis of facts .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
and that the speech provides the key to many important questions of understanding , which have long perplexed and shackled our minds .  The speech emphasizes the necessity to carry out theoretical innovation by persistently integrating the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with realities in China ; and to emancipate our minds from outdated concepts and structures , from erroneous and dogmatic understanding of Marxism , and from the shackles of subjectivism and metaphysics .  
given a concentrated expression to the latest achievements in theoretical innovation that have been attained by the party 's leading collective of the third generation ; and is therefore an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory on political parties .  The important thinking of " three represents " has pointed out the direction for our efforts to push forward the great project of strengthening party building under the present new historical conditions and to subsequently attain constant new victories in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech is imbued throughout with a scientific attitude to Marxism and the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts ; it upholds Marxism without rigid adherence to individual conclusion , carries forward the fine traditions while also being bold to clear the way to forge ahead , and proposes a whole series of new ideas and concepts , expressing major theoretical innovations .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .  Jiang Zemin 's speech shows a strategic foresight , provides profound ideas , gives theoretical guidance to many issues , and is another important programmatic document of our party to carry forward its cause into the future .  
They said : The important thinking on " three represents " set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin provides the foundation underlying our efforts for building the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  It inherits and develops the Marxist party-building theory , embodies the ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts , embodies our party 's character and fundamental principle , and embodies the spirit of theoretical innovation and advancing with the times .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Being a theoretical breakthrough for the CPC , the important thinking of " three represents " has summed up the history , taken account of the realities , analyzed a situation at home and abroad , with stress on the former , and has fundamentally enshrined the flesh and blood ties between the CPC and the broad masses of the people , thus bringing to light what the people desire and need , and how the CPC should keep its advanced nature unchanged . 
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
In his " 1 July " speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a penetrating exposition on the important concept of " three represents " and put forward new ideas and views on a number of major theoretical and practical issues concerning party building and the socialist modernization drive , thereby pointing out the direction for advancing the cause of the party and the country in the coming century .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's exposition on continuously building up the party 's class foundation , expanding the party 's mass foundation , and raising the party 's influence on society in the light of the reality in economic development and social advancement has provided the scientific theoretical basis for consolidating and strengthening the party 's leadership and increasing the party 's creativity , cohesive power , and combat capability under the conditions of the socialist market economy .  
It comprehensively summed up the glorious course and basic experiences of the party , systematically expounded the important concept of " three represents , " explicitly set the basic requirements of strengthening and improving party building , and profoundly answered major theoretical and practical questions of fundamental importance with a bearing on the overall situation , about which people had been concerned .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
To triumph in future sea battles under a high-tech environment , in recent years officers and men of the logistical department of the East China Sea Fleet base have centered on the most complex and difficult situations , combined theoretical study and training on the sea , and boldly reformed and innovated logistical measures to stage splendid performances in logistical support on the sea .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
The study activities have thus entered a new stage of assiduous study , conscientious pondering , organization of research on special topics , and firm implementation .  On 29 July , the central group for theoretical study of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee once again organized a study course to exchange what had been gained in the study , and all participants freely aired what they had learned from the study .  The atmosphere was lively throughout the study course .

According to the uniform view expressed , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , grasped the overall situation , was based on an elevated perspective , and comprehensively reviewed and systematically summed up the party 's splendid history and basic experience of 80 years , thereby constituting a programmatic Marxist document rich in theoretical innovation , educating and encouraging the people , and urging the people forward .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Philosophy and social science workers must engage in theoretical studies in light of actual situations .  They should pay attention to studying those important issues that have a close bearing on the situation as a whole , issues that will appear in the future , and strategic issues so that theoretical , institutional , and scientific-technological innovations will proceed vigorously .  
They should establish their footing on the current situation of the country , advance with the time , break new grounds , pay attention primarily to studying the important issues in real life , draw the rich resources and strong power for their theoretical innovation from reforms , opening up and modernization drive , closely follow the trend of world development , and profoundly understand the laws for contemporary China 's economic and social development .

Those attending the meeting earnestly studied General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech and his speech at a meeting on 7 August with some experts in science and technology for national defense and in social sciences .  They also held discussions on the major theoretical issues facing China in early 21st century and the measures to deal with them , the current situation and development prospects of China 's social sciences studies , and the academic studies and personnel cultivation of the China Academy of Social Sciences in the new situation .  
Various units , in conducting training classes on rotation basis for leading cadres at and above regimental level , have guided the participants to emancipate their minds , take a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts , study and grasp the newest theoretical achievements of the speech , and lay stress on penetratingly understanding and fully grasping the basic viewpoints and spirit of the speech .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .

As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The meeting stressed : General Secretary Jiang 's important idea of " three represents " is distinctly characteristic of the times and is very strong as a theory , highly practical , and highly relevant .  This is a major theoretical and practical issue put forward to the entire party .  
The first group of county ( municipal ) " three stresses " educational work have the following special characteristics : First , through emphasis on taking hold of theoretical learning , in particular conscientiously learning Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important ideology of the " three represents " , leading cadres have received a rather systematic theoretical education .  Second , leading cadres are living in the villages and going into the households resulting in extensive arousal of the masses to action , introduction of the " three stresses " , and warm welcomes by the masses .  
Even if we believe that his theory is overly simplistic and has moral relativistic or moral equivalent tendencies if applied to the real world , we must still acknowledge that there is some truth to it and that it serves as a valuable theoretical reference as we ponder today 's international politics .  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
The circular demanded : We should deepen theory study by taking the important thinking of " three represents " as a core content and should further deepen understanding of the basic theoretical view of " three stresses , " and invigorate and grasp study in a down-to-earth manner in light of the characteristics at the grass-roots level and in various forms .

Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .

During the theoretical study , the central study teams of the party committees at all levels of the Navy elaborated the major realistic issues in the Navy 's modernization program and preparations for military struggles to more than 100 specific topics for study and practice .  Focused on these topics , they guided the reading , investigations , research , exchanges , and application of the leading cadres at all levels .  
With Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important expositions and the major policy decisions as the guide , the Navy party committee shared the work among its standing committee members .  Through the activities of inspecting and guiding work at the grassroots units , going to sea on the vessels , working and living with the rank and file , and having heart-to-heart talks with them , the party committee introduced more than 30 theoretical research topics , which included political building , military training , equipment scientific research , and logistics supply for Navy building in the new period .  
Philosophy is an advanced form of theoretical thinking ; and is a fundamental stand , viewpoint , and method used by people for observing , understanding , and guiding both practice and scientific research .  
To our knowledge , these localities , after seriously studying and discussing the central leading comrades ' important speeches , made a further mobilization and set aside more than a week 's time for a concentrated theoretical study .  Following the extensive reading in the preceding stage , they practiced intensive reading , conducted special-subject education , and pondered theories in light of reality .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
Xu Zhigong has long been engaged in the work of political theoretical education and research .  Over the years , he has regarded the implementation of Chairman Jiang 's instruction of " arming the people with scientific theories " as his lofty mission , worked with ardent loyalty , studied assiduously , made innovations in a pioneering spirit , and has achieved remarkable results in the teaching and research of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
The publication of this yearbook filled a major void in China 's human rights theoretical building , provided authoritative materials for the international community to understand China 's views on human rights and China 's human rights reality , and provided effective objective facts and theories to refute international hostile forces ' distortion of and attack against China 's human rights conditions .  
In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
This important thinking , with rich content , profound thought and prominent characteristics of the current era , being highly theoretical and practicable , is a new summary of the Party 's nature , of its essential principles and of its historic mission , is a new development in Marxist theory on Party construction and is a new requirement of the Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the new situation .  
In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
For example , some people have laid stress on their professional work while making light of theory .  According to these people , theory is soft and nominal , and it makes no difference how much theoretical knowledge one will master ; whereas professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology is solid and real , and one 's knowledge in this aspect can be measured easily .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
In view of the " shortcomings " and weak points in the building of equipment department , this department vigorously carried out , organized , and directed the training while selecting personnel and grasping professional basic training .  It also cultivated equipment commanders at all levels who have military theoretical accomplishment and macro decision-making awareness , and raised the organizational and planning ability of equipment organs .  
In the drill , on one hand , this department attached prime importance to theoretical study , scientifically analyzed and evaluated the present situation of the theater 's support capacity , especially its own units , and comprehensively grasped the characteristics of the theater 's topography , weather , social situation , popular feelings , and the actual conditions of the equipment and combat readiness , and provided guidance for troops ' practical work .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
The Party Central Committee rallying around Comrade Jiang Zemin raised high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and led forward the entire party and all the peoples of the nation along the road pointed out by Deng Xiaoping Theory , achieving numerous new successes in the building of socialism , while at the same time continuously pursuing theoretical development and innovation based on new experiences and new situations .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
As a result , the troops have achieved the purpose of learning to give self and mutual medical aid on the battle ground ; the exercise has reached a reliable theoretical basis for the troops in grasping and using troop disposition , board and lodging , and fighting and hiding of the squad to reduce to the maximum degree casualties of non-combat personnel for future operations in the lofty mountains and jungles ; and the achievement has filled gaps in the aspect of field survival for troops .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
During the 1950s , along with a high-degree synthetic development from a unitary structure of the Army to a combined structure for all services and arms , including the Navy and the Air Force , and following its coordinated air-ground operations on the battlefield in Korea as well as its preliminary practice of a joint landing operations at Yijiangshan Island , our military started to put on its work schedule the theoretical study of coordinated operations involving all services and arms , and attained major achievements in this aspect .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
All these activities provide rich basic materials for the research of human rights theories , expand the scope of human right theoretical research in China , and have filled up some gaps in the research of human rights in China , enhanced the level of human rights theoretical research , and also provided a benign social environment for the development of human rights theoretical research in China .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .  
Article 4 .  National defense education shall be based on the principle of participation by the whole people , long-term perseverance , and seeking practical results ; the principle of combining regular education with concentrated education , universal education with focused education , and theoretical education with behavioral education should be pursued ; and its implementation should be organized by category , with the contents of education determined according to different recipients of education .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
The basic theories , basic line , and basic program established by the party have provided an important ideological and theoretical weapon for our settlement of these problems ; the constantly enhanced bearing capacity of the vast numbers of masses in society has provided a more favorable social environment for our settlement of these problems ;  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
We should , in accordance with the characteristics of this educational campaign , satisfactorily conduct programs to study , supervise and discuss crucial and specific issues and topics , understand Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " in association with the Marxist theory on Party-building , consider this thinking in accordance with the positive and negative experiences of the CPC and parties of foreign countries , and study this thinking in association with replying and solving the significant theoretical and practical issues we are facing at present .  
We should not only be aware of the significant development and the significant contributions , but also profoundly understand the substantial significance for the practice and the guiding role .  In this way , we can comprehensively and accurately master the ideological and theoretical system and lay down a solid theoretical and ideological foundation for Party members to conscientiously put their advanced nature into practice .  
In line with the work arrangements of the Central Military Commission and the PLA General Political Department , all major units of the PLA have engaged in theoretical studies ; carried out discussions and exchanged experiences ; and have enhanced their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in running well the education activity in close connection with the historical experiences that our party has gained in carrying out its struggle in unity over the past 80 years , and with the complex developments in the present situation of struggle both inside and outside the country .  
These works containing tens of millions of characters have embodied in a concentrated way the two major theoretical achievements of the integration of the Marxist basic tenets with the specific realities in China - - the essence of Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and they are the most precious ideological wealth of the whole party .  
At present , the important " three represents " thinking has become a major topic in the theoretical study of the entire party and a focal point of the " three stresses " education conducted among leading cadres at all levels .  It has also become an important content of our theoretical research and propaganda work conducted by our press circles .  Practicing the " three represents " thinking has become a conscious act of the broad masses of party members and cadres .  
At this moment commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China , we should meticulously study these important expositions , in light of the Party 's glorious history , solve problems by uniting reality with history and combining perspectives with reasoning , genuinely base socialist conviction on a solid ideological and theoretical foundation and transform praises of socialism to a self-mobilized advancement of the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the 21st century .  
The two major theoretical results are the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the party and the people , the valuable spiritual wealth of our party , and the great banner that guides us to advance triumphantly .  
While efforts are made in history researches , attention should also be paid to propaganda , to the collection and sorting-out of raw historical materials , and to theoretical generation and analysis so that the party history work will be raised to a new level .  Second , adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts , adhere to the analytical method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism .  Everything should be based on historical facts , and truth should be sought on the basis of facts .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
and that the speech provides the key to many important questions of understanding , which have long perplexed and shackled our minds .  The speech emphasizes the necessity to carry out theoretical innovation by persistently integrating the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with realities in China ; and to emancipate our minds from outdated concepts and structures , from erroneous and dogmatic understanding of Marxism , and from the shackles of subjectivism and metaphysics .  
given a concentrated expression to the latest achievements in theoretical innovation that have been attained by the party 's leading collective of the third generation ; and is therefore an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory on political parties .  The important thinking of " three represents " has pointed out the direction for our efforts to push forward the great project of strengthening party building under the present new historical conditions and to subsequently attain constant new victories in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech is imbued throughout with a scientific attitude to Marxism and the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts ; it upholds Marxism without rigid adherence to individual conclusion , carries forward the fine traditions while also being bold to clear the way to forge ahead , and proposes a whole series of new ideas and concepts , expressing major theoretical innovations .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .  Jiang Zemin 's speech shows a strategic foresight , provides profound ideas , gives theoretical guidance to many issues , and is another important programmatic document of our party to carry forward its cause into the future .  
They said : The important thinking on " three represents " set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin provides the foundation underlying our efforts for building the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  It inherits and develops the Marxist party-building theory , embodies the ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts , embodies our party 's character and fundamental principle , and embodies the spirit of theoretical innovation and advancing with the times .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Being a theoretical breakthrough for the CPC , the important thinking of " three represents " has summed up the history , taken account of the realities , analyzed a situation at home and abroad , with stress on the former , and has fundamentally enshrined the flesh and blood ties between the CPC and the broad masses of the people , thus bringing to light what the people desire and need , and how the CPC should keep its advanced nature unchanged . 
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
In his " 1 July " speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a penetrating exposition on the important concept of " three represents " and put forward new ideas and views on a number of major theoretical and practical issues concerning party building and the socialist modernization drive , thereby pointing out the direction for advancing the cause of the party and the country in the coming century .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's exposition on continuously building up the party 's class foundation , expanding the party 's mass foundation , and raising the party 's influence on society in the light of the reality in economic development and social advancement has provided the scientific theoretical basis for consolidating and strengthening the party 's leadership and increasing the party 's creativity , cohesive power , and combat capability under the conditions of the socialist market economy .  
It comprehensively summed up the glorious course and basic experiences of the party , systematically expounded the important concept of " three represents , " explicitly set the basic requirements of strengthening and improving party building , and profoundly answered major theoretical and practical questions of fundamental importance with a bearing on the overall situation , about which people had been concerned .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
To triumph in future sea battles under a high-tech environment , in recent years officers and men of the logistical department of the East China Sea Fleet base have centered on the most complex and difficult situations , combined theoretical study and training on the sea , and boldly reformed and innovated logistical measures to stage splendid performances in logistical support on the sea .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
The study activities have thus entered a new stage of assiduous study , conscientious pondering , organization of research on special topics , and firm implementation .  On 29 July , the central group for theoretical study of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee once again organized a study course to exchange what had been gained in the study , and all participants freely aired what they had learned from the study .  The atmosphere was lively throughout the study course .

Jiang Zemin stressed : Philosophy and social science workers must engage in theoretical studies in light of actual situations .  They should pay attention to studying those important issues that have a close bearing on the situation as a whole , issues that will appear in the future , and strategic issues so that theoretical , institutional , and scientific-technological innovations will proceed vigorously .  
They should establish their footing on the current situation of the country , advance with the time , break new grounds , pay attention primarily to studying the important issues in real life , draw the rich resources and strong power for their theoretical innovation from reforms , opening up and modernization drive , closely follow the trend of world development , and profoundly understand the laws for contemporary China 's economic and social development .

The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .

As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The meeting stressed : General Secretary Jiang 's important idea of " three represents " is distinctly characteristic of the times and is very strong as a theory , highly practical , and highly relevant .  This is a major theoretical and practical issue put forward to the entire party .  
The first group of county ( municipal ) " three stresses " educational work have the following special characteristics : First , through emphasis on taking hold of theoretical learning , in particular conscientiously learning Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important ideology of the " three represents " , leading cadres have received a rather systematic theoretical education .  Second , leading cadres are living in the villages and going into the households resulting in extensive arousal of the masses to action , introduction of the " three stresses " , and warm welcomes by the masses .  
Even if we believe that his theory is overly simplistic and has moral relativistic or moral equivalent tendencies if applied to the real world , we must still acknowledge that there is some truth to it and that it serves as a valuable theoretical reference as we ponder today 's international politics .  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
The circular demanded : We should deepen theory study by taking the important thinking of " three represents " as a core content and should further deepen understanding of the basic theoretical view of " three stresses , " and invigorate and grasp study in a down-to-earth manner in light of the characteristics at the grass-roots level and in various forms .

Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .
