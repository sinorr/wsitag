The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated .

And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds .

" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science . Teachers have carefully created a systematic curriculum , designed diversified teaching activities , and produced supplementary educational materials and lectures not part of the standard textbooks .

These varied activities were aimed at giving people deeper understanding into the inner meaning of religious culture .  
Attentive visitors can also learn some of the many stories the guesthouses have to tell . For example , the exceptionally stylish Garden of Rushes has a beautiful garden , an elegantly decorated interior , and a marvelously graceful innkeeper who looks as if she had just stepped out of one of Chiung Yao 's romances . But the kicker is that the garden , which features a small bridge over running water , was designed and built by the innkeeper and her husband in their spare time .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
As soon as the music stopped , the actors instantly went stock still , their suddenly motionless poses designed the better to exaggerate their formidable power .

But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
Regular shoes are designed to fit normally arched feet . However , because the soles of flat feet are insufficiently arched , making it difficult to maintain a solid footing , it is best for people with flat feet to add an arch support when exercising , as this will reduce the chance of soreness .  
For the children 's forest playground , Chang designed the observation deck , determined the angle at which to set the slide , and calculated how much wood would be needed for the project .
