As the state 's stock of grain was doubled and redoubled between 1995 and 1999 , and the grain stored in peasant households exceeded 500 kg per capita during the same period , equivalent to two years ' quantity for personal consumption , we can believe that the total net import volume of 30.19 million tonnes in 1995 and 1996 was not a result of real demand due to domestic grain shortage .

On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions , a global average of one third ( varying by region from one seventh to two thirds ) of the existing global forested area is likely to undergo a change in broad vegetation types , with the most changes occurring in high latitudes and fewer in the tropics .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

The pay for a general civil servant is divided into " base salary " and " supplementary salary . " It differs according to rating and position . Ratings , from low to high , go from designated rank to recommended rank to selected rank , with the lowest being designated rank-1 and the highest selected rank-14 ( equivalent to an office director ) .  
Because the purpose of the garden is to display all kinds of plant life , and it has been operated for almost 100 years , the trees are tall and vigorous , the floor beneath the trees is damp and dark , and people are prohibited from walking in certain areas . Added to all this , there is a rippling pond . This is the equivalent to manufacturing an optimal environment for living things . "  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land .

The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "

If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level .

Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves .

The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .

On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .
