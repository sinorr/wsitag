The taciturn Megawati , widely seen as aloof and neglectful of ordinary people , has recently worked hard to reverse the perceptions during the month-long presidential campaign .  She held occasional press conferences and visited markets and other centres to mingle with the public .  
Chinese scientists ' research on human genome has been fully supported by the State 's Program 869 and Program 973 , Natural Science Foundation and others .  On April 21 , the relevant person in charge at the State Natural Science Foundation said in an interview that opening the human gene database to the public free of charge can allow ordinary people access to the cutting-edge science .  The person in charge said the more the public get to know about the innovative science , the more motivated scientists will feel for research .  
Etienne Clement , the director of UNESCO office in Cambodia , said the problem of massive looting and trafficking of underground heritages started about five years ago , when the Cambodian government successfully cracked down on illicit trafficking of stone statuary from famous temples , so heritage traffickers have began to smuggle " less spectacular ordinary antiquities . "  
Liu Guangyou , a senior submarine officer who had fought on the sea for 30 years , clearly understood that after a ten-odd-day long voyage , the bearing capabilities of both the equipment and the crew had reached the limits .  So , staying longer for another one minute under water would be several dozen times more dangerous than the ordinary times .  
Marx pointed out in " Critique of the Gotha Program " that in future society , some of total social output should be set aside for replenishing exhausted means of production , for expanding reproduction , for common needs such as ordinary management expenses , schools , and public health facilities , and for use as reserve or guarantee funds for dealing with unfortunate accidents and natural disasters , and for establishing a fund for people who have lost their laboring ability , and so on .  
The worst victims of the bombing and sanctions were ordinary Yugoslav people .  Because of inadequate funds , many industries , mines , and enterprises stopped operations .  Many staff and workers were forced to take compulsory leave and wrer only entitled to partial wages .  
Specifically speaking , the United Nations should stick to the principle that countries , big or small , should be equal , pay attention to the positive principle of world development , implement the principle of generally acknowledged truth of its peacekeeping action , follow the just principle of reforming the United Nations , carry out the consistent principle of opposing power politics of the superpower , observe the peace principle of settling international disputes , and maintaining the principle of neutrality for all UN personnel from the chief executive of the Secretariat to the ordinary working personnel .  
Not only does information industry have a decisive impact on the livelihood of the ordinary people in China today but also , more importantly , it has become an important indicator of China 's comprehensive national strength .  Moreover , it has been universally acknowledged as China 's strategic industry in its economic and social development in the next century .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
Based on the Law of Officers on Active Service in the People 's Republic of China , by implementing systems of officer selection from ordinary universities and colleges , promoting outstanding soldiers and graduates through military academies , the practices have broadened the selection resources of military officers through both channels of internal promotion : military training and external recruitment from ordinary schools of high learning .  In this way , the basic qualities of prospective officers have a sound basis .  
Li Hongzhi and company plotted in secret rooms , lit fires in the grass roots , besieged colleges , disrupted the fight against floods , encircled Zhongnanhai , and carried out self-immolation in Tiananmen Square ; all these were planned and organized , and had program and aims .  As he himself said , this was in order to " change the situation of the society of ordinary persons " .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
The classroom breakdown and a sharp increase in juvenile crime pained the ordinary folks greatly .  The Aum Supreme Truth 's spreading sarin gas at a Tokyo metro station sent a chill down people 's spines and made them uneasey .  And the impending collapse of the social security system , including the pension fund system , made them feel bleak about their future .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
Try and imagine , the moment a rocket lifts off from earth and shoots into the sky , the tremendous sense of accomplishment and happiness that surges in the hearts of every person involved in space flight when seeing the ever shrinking difference between the level of China 's space flight technology and the most advanced international levels and when seeing the ever increasing international position of China as a result of this is something that is difficult for the ordinary person to understand .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
Tianjin has timely quickened the pace of building ordinary senior high schools in various ways and expanded and rebuilt 16 well-managed high schools , increasing the numbers of students admitted to senior high schools , winning local residents ' favorable comments .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Yang Xueyi , associate research fellow of the " 18 September Historical Museum , " briefed that after the " 18 September Incident , " the Japanese aggressor troops engineered a series of atrocious massacres in Liaoning . On 16 September 1932 , the Japanese army carried out a barbarous policy of burning and killing .  About 3,000 innocent ordinary people living in the neighborhood of Pingding Shan in Fushun were killed and all the houses were burned down .  
Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

During the period while on reserve service , officers are required to receive training for three months ; soldiers of ordinary arms who were once on active service or have gone through the basic training of the militia are required to receive training for one months , while those who have never received any basic training should be trained for an additional month ; and those serving in professional and technical arms are required to receive training for two months , while the training time is relatively longer for those who need to master more sophisticated technologies .  
Through eliminating bad assets and instilling fine assets , some listed companies running in the red or those whose achievements are just ordinary have seen a thoroughgoing change and adopted a new outlook .  Their unpopular stocks , which were originally not in investors ' favor , or their " garbage stocks , " have become hot stocks pursued by the market and have entered the rank of high-price stocks enjoying good sales .  
Some law experts note that because LC fraud involves many middle links , and units and personnel at home and overseas that take part in the fraud are entitled to service charges illegally .  They say that fraud carried out in collusion by lawless elements at home and abroad , while preventing banks from collecting the loans they have extended and increasing their bad debts by geometric progression , is often accompanied by corruption , bribery , and other forms of lawlessness .  Thus its danger to society is even more penetrating and extensive than ordinary crimes .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
Because of influence by the United States ' traditional anti-Communist ideology and China policy , there are fairly strong anti-China forces in the American society , and some public opinions are deeply biased against and hostile to China . Under such an atmosphere , some politicians regarded playing " espionage cases " as the most convenient and effective anti-China tactic and thereupon made Wen Ho Lee , an ordinary scientist , their first target of attack .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
Because of well-developed IT infrastructure and the appearance of many intelligent buildings and wired communities and because net life and information-based consumption are accessible to ordinary citizens , more and more people can experience the virtues of distance learning , distance medical care , digital library , and shopping , house search , stock trading , and sightseeing on cyberspace .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
Strictly speaking , the reason given by this customer for his choice of a commodity may not be scientific enough , yet it does have a strong " humanistic " color , for loving one thing on account of another is only natural to all ordinary people .  
They colluded with Huang Guolin , a dismissed worker of customs , smuggled goods valued at more than $ 88 million , and evaded a tax worth more than 17.6 million yuan .  The judgement was : Fu Zhijian and Huang Guolin committed a crime of smuggling ordinary goods ; they were sentenced to death , and deprived of political rights for life , with their personal property confiscated and turned over to the national treasury .  
We should continue to properly distribute supplementary loans allocated under national debts , and ensure that enterprises - - whose products are saleable , and which are efficient and trustworthy - - can attain current funds needed for their production .  We should be very cautious when considering extending loans for ordinary fixed assets , and pay attention to preventing new and redundant projects in processing industries .  
His conduct constituted crimes of smuggling ordinary goods , accepting bribes , embezzlement , unauthorized partitioning of state-owned assets and possessing large amounts of property of unaccountable origins .  Due to the enormous amount of money involved and the especially serious circumstances , in the judgment of first instance , he was sentenced to death , deprived of political rights for life , and subjected to confiscation of all personal property .  
As pointed out by Regina Ip , the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa is no ordinary organization .  Besides being heretical and making people obsessed , it is also a tightly built organization with strong mobilization power and financial resources and is targeting itself directly at the central authorities .  Its activities have caused public concern , and it is also necessary for the government to pay attention to their activities .  
From the national capital to the most impoverished province of Gansu and from ordinary seminars in various localities to the current annual session of the National People 's Congress , the supreme organ of power , everybody is talking about one thing : " Are you prepared for China 's WTO accession ? "  
After the initial excitement subsided upon hearing Premier Zhu Rongji 's report on the outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which lists " new carrier rocket models , " " high-speed , broad-band information networks , " and " key integrated circuits " as three major high-tech projects that China will give priority to supporting over the next five years , he has been pondering these questions : New carrier rocket models seem to have very little to do with the lives of ordinary people .  Why are we paying so much attention to them ?  
Speaking at a ceremony of the Community Building Project " We Build And We Care " in Tseung Kwan O , he said the Government attached great importance to housing issues , especially on how to help ordinary people own their homes at reasonable and affordable prices .  The ultimate objective was to build a society in which people can live and work in peace and harmony .  Mr Tung said the objective was important in enhancing a sense of belonging to the community and maintaining social stability .  
" As business of captive insurers is restricted to underwriting exclusively general business of its group companies and it is not permitted to engage in statutory insurance businesses like motor and employees ' compensation insurance , captive insurers are subject to a much less stringent regulatory regime than that applicable to ordinary insurers , " he said .  
The paper noted that the existing Indemnity Fund does not compensate clients for money lost by reason of the fraudulent act of solicitors who are sole practitioners or partners of a firm .  Moreover , it compensates clients in respect of a fraud perpetrated by a solicitor 's employee only if the solicitor could have prevented the fraud by exercising ordinary care and skill in the management of the practice .  The paper considered this position to be unsatisfactory .  
Section 19A ( 1 ) provides that , where a provision of an Ordinance is ambiguous or obscure , or its ordinary meaning in the context in which it is used leads to a result that is absurd or unreasonable , then material not forming part of the Ordinance but which is capable of assisting in ascertaining the meaning of the provision ( " extrinsic material " ) , may be considered for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the provision .  
A " non-immunity " clause is normally included in Ordinances establishing a corporation or other body which is empowered to perform public or semi-public functions but which is intended to operate independently of the Government . The " non-immunity " clause makes it clear that the body is independent and ensures that it is treated in law as an ordinary private body .  
Students with moderate to profound hearing impairment and having acquired sufficient language skills are integrated in ordinary classes .  Inspectors of ED visit schools regularly to advise teachers and social workers on how best to support these students .  
" The award winners include a blind acting Chief Executive Officer who has been with the Government for 21 years ; a deaf senior cook who has been working in a hotel for four years ; a Chinese calligraphist who , though without his right arm , can type faster than ordinary people ; and a single-eyed mentally retarded cleaner who participates in voluntary service after work , and has been commended as an outstanding young volunteer . "  
Behind this internationally accepted definition is the consensus that there is a qualitative difference between terrorist acts capable of inflicting massive and indiscriminate injury and damage to the public and ordinary criminal activities , such as criminal damage , assault or even murder . 
In relation to broadcasting , the television and radio Codes of Practice issued by the Broadcasting Authority require licensees to observe at all times certain basic standards in the presentation of programmes , including news broadcasts .  A licensee should not include in its programmes any material that is indecent , obscene , or of bad taste and which is not acceptable to ordinary viewers .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Clear , white , grey , and yellow are the more highly valued colors , while blue and green are considered more ordinary .  
According to Chinese legend , during the T'ang dynasty there were two enlightened holy mee from the sacred Buddhist area of T'ien T'ai mountain , Shih Te and Han Shan . They lived as ordinary monks responsible for the kitchen duties in the Kuo Ch'ing Temple . Speaking to each other in a language unintelligible to others , they were considered crazy by the other monks .

As such tales of discovery go , the development of the wind surfer did not occur in some grandiose manner , but instead , in the ordinary confines of a suburban California garage , some 18 years ago . Two young friends , one an avid surfer , the other a disciple of sailing , were engaged in a friendly debate over the relative merits of their favorite pastimes .  
Halfway up the slope of a mountain on the Chiufen-Shuanghsi road rests a silent wooden workers ' hut . Chiufen resident Lin Hsin-hsiung takes us up a section of road and into the hut . This hut is built next to an unobtrusive and ordinary mine pit opening , and were it not for the gold panning paraphernalia just outside it would be hard to tell that this was indeed a gold mine .  
The sound of the waking clappers is actually very low , which the ordinary people generally can not hear as they sleep . The monks are tranquil and quiet in body and mind ; to them , even a falling twig can be heard , not to mention the clappers .  
The painstaking process of raising them , in which expense is no object , would be inconceivable in ordinary hog raising , which is aimed at economic efficiency , but religious or spiritual values can never be measured in terms of economic efficiency .  
Try and imagine pa-pao fan [ eight treasures rice ] made from ordinary rice . No one would find it fully satisfying , even if it were studded with purple dates or green plums . Nien-kao [ New Year 's cake ] is another sticky food that is fit for eating only when made from glutinous rice .  
These flowers are not the same as common plants because they move about and they are probably five times the size of ordinary plants - - but common plants are no match for the beauty of these migrant plants which are purple , red , blue , yellow , and green colored suns - - their stalks are pretty girls and they float around rootless like duckweed .  
The fourth costume consists of a plain blue dress of the early Republican period reflecting ordinary family life of the time . The fifth costume is a cheongsam , originally worn in the Ch'ing dynasty but still popular today , a typically Chinese style of women 's dress .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
Decoration costs and rising rents were soon reflected in menu prices , and " sometimes their meals were more pricey than any ordinary restaurant . " Mr . Yang maintains that once beer parlors started charging stiff prices and had lost the advantage of novelty all the charm went out of them , their unique atmosphere evaporated and their business started tailing off .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
Some people have criticized the education of gifted children as elitist , as a " gilded lily " taking up valuable educational resources , but Tzeng Su-jung , a doctor of education , disagrees . " If gifted students are put in ordinary classes and wind up with blank expressions all the time because they 've mastered the material , is n't that a form of learning disadvantage , too ? "  
Thinking back to the dictatorial imperial system , " worshipping Heaven " was a special privilege reserved for the Son of Heaven ( the Emperor ) . in the Ching dynasty , there was still the regulation that any ordinary person caught worshipping Heaven directly would be punished with 80 strokes of the rod , so that common folk had no choice but to worship in secret .  
The ordinary teachers are also rigorously tested , attend lessons and write theses . Publishing articles in academic journals is compulsory work and under-taking research occupies at least half the workload . The topics of research are decided from above and there is no autonomy here . " Researchers in national defense have all been through a strict process of selection , " says V . Prudnikov .  
The rise in TB in the U . S . is probably related to the huge increase in AIDS , " says Lin Tao-ping , director of the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau . Once their immune system breaks down , AIDS sufferers are defenseless against communicable diseases . Twenty to 30 percent of them contract tuberculosis , especially atypical forms of the bacillus that ordinary people are not readily susceptible to and which are highly resistant to medication .  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
An IQ of from 50 to 70 is considered mildly retarded ; the focus of education is similar to that of ordinary children , with more emphasis on practical applied learning . People with IQs from 35 to 50 are classified as moderately retarded , with the focus of education placed on taking care of one 's own daily necessities , communication with others , developing job skills , and basic knowledge .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
In terms of land management , besides continuing the " royal demesne " system , the " garrison field system " was adopted . Under this system , in ordinary times soldiers would farm the land and be self-sufficient . This saved the government money , gave the soldiers land to farm , established a sound foundation for agriculture , and even led to major accomplishments in terms of economic activities important to the daily life of the people ( such as salt and sugar production , water conservancy , and paddy cultivation ) .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
Liang Chiungpai notes that not only do pickled veggies keep well for a long time , they come in many flavors , covering the gamut from sour and salty to sweet and hot ; they also help relieve that bloated feeling . Available to both rich and poor alike , and appropriate for both holidays and ordinary meals , these little appetizers are eminently suited to accompany fine cuisine .  
Song people really played out their penchant for probing things ' inner nature . Not bothered with ordinary flowers Thus categorized by the people of the Song , not only was the plum flower judged the most virtuous of the " noble four " of the black plum , the orchid , the bamboo and the chrysanthemum-the names of its cousins the peach , the Japanese plum , the cherry and the almond were all blackened .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
The brutal murder of an ordinary postgraduate student at a prestigious university , in a research institute building with access restricted by the use of a magnetic card reader , shocked the public and aroused the special concern of the police .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
In an ordinary class there are too many students to do any activities , and you 're stuck with traditional teaching methods . In order to keep things moving along , it is n't possible to look after the needs of students who fall behind . But in the experimental class , students are divided into four groups according to ability , with no more than eight students in each group . Every student has a chance to speak , and students of different abilities can be brought along at their own pace , and not abandoned .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
In contrast to the solemn chanting heard in temples and monasteries , this new melodic , orchestral form made for good background music at places of worship , where it enhanced the atmosphere of devotion . It also found favor with ordinary believers , who could play it at home while cooking , eating and doing their chores , confident that Buddha would n't be offended .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
The main protagonists : a young , runaway unmarried mother , and her older brother-the director-who films the documentary . How will they deal with the events that upset the ordinary pattern of family life ? How will family members react to these crises ? And how will they overcome their mutual misunderstandings to recreate a harmonious and happy family atmosphere ?  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World . It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
" Independent , close to ordinary people 's hearts , vital , spring-flowering , sublimely pure and noble . " Students involved in the student movement of the late 1980s created a huge wild lily modeled on the Statue of Liberty , to symbolize the spirit of the Taiwanese student movement .  
Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
The contents of the exhibit can be divided into four categories . First are the splendid and ornate gold and silver pieces of the Tang dynasty royal family , followed by the tricolor glaze pottery and ceramic pieces that were used by the ordinary folk of that time . Then there are the Buddhist and Taoist statues that evoke the Tang 's flourishing and diverse religious environment .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
In imposing its rule over Taiwan , Japan deliberately gave concrete forms to its imperial authority , as we can see from many historical documents . For example , there were precise rules governing the number of buttons , the weapons , and the shoes of ordinary policemen . With the adoption of such detailed forms , throughout society a new body language took shape that expressed degrees of authority . You can still see this in the body language of older people .  
Because , in the eyes of an ordinary person , their abilities border on pure magic . A painter uses a brush , a bit of ink , and a few colors to create a world beyond anything we could imagine . A poet takes the words we all learned in elementary school and writes them into verses that people recite for centuries . Musicians compose simple sounds into musical pieces that are played for generations .  
In terms of literary value , Wang Dan 's essays do not come up to the same level as his poetry . But for the ordinary reader , in contrast to the more obscure poems the essays seem to offer a more accessible point of entry for understanding the soul of the exile . This is despite the fact that it is quite obvious that Wang carefully works to preserve his private space .  
In the eyes of the Japanese colonial authorities , Chiang was Public Enemy No . 1 . Among Taiwanese intellectuals , he was widely recognized as a pioneer . And among ordinary citizens he was revered as a charismatic leader , a guiding force for cultural renaissance and a dedicated opponent of the injustices of the colonial regime .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
He was born in 1968 in Shanhua Township , Tainan County . In middle school he began to attend the local Holy Church , where Rev . Wang Tung-ho filled him with inspiration and guided his religious development . In his 30s , Wang had given up a bright future in the city and moved to the countryside to minister to the ordinary folk of the township .  
Second , there is the question as to how specific intent to commit an act of genocide ( where an accused is alleged to have killed a single human being ) is to be distinguished from an act of ordinary murder or the killing of several from mass murder .

Of more far-ranging significance is the fact that the issue of political status has now been dubbed too complicated , too confusing and too separated from the everyday issues of economic , political and social life to be of any moment to the ordinary resident of the Territory .  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
This ignorance of norms is compounded by deficiencies of legal interpretation and reasoning , as evidenced in the literal and disjointed application of ordinary law and a marked emphasis on procedural - as opposed to substantive - issues .  
Having considered the issue thoroughly , the contact group noted that : ( 1 ) the word " gender " had been commonly used and understood in its ordinary , generally accepted usage in numerous other United Nations forums and conferences ; ( 2 ) there was no indication that any new meaning or connotation of the term , different from accepted prior usage , was intended in the Platform for Action .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
Having considered the issue thoroughly , the contact group noted that : ( 1 ) the word " gender " had been commonly used and understood in its ordinary , generally accepted usage in numerous other United Nations forums and conferences ; ( 2 ) there was no indication that any new meaning or connotation of the term , different from accepted prior usage , was intended in the Platform for Action .  
If an international crime was to be designated as a qualified case of an international breach of law , there was a need for a special regime governing State responsibility , which must include a set of legal consequences going beyond the consequences of ordinary wrongful acts and which must put the instrumental consequences of the crime under the supervision of a judicial authority .  
The civil service is trying to provide specific answers to this popular concern through transparent processes that are available to ordinary citizens , who in this way can find out not only how , why and for what purpose a particular civil servant was hired , but also how much this costs the State and , above all , what that person 's actual contribution is in measurable terms of quantity , quality and cost-effectiveness .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
Peace is built through ordinary coexistence , with all Guatemalans , male or female , striving daily to make a living and to help their families get ahead , seeking out better opportunities while enduring hardships in a country with so many limitations and so much distrust . 
In obtaining evidence for the verification of this commitment , the Mission faces the persistence , characteristic of Guatemala , of large numbers of homicides , death threats , kidnappings and other serious crimes which , because they are committed by ordinary criminals or unidentified persons , are not recorded as human rights violations which are directly attributable to agents of the State or politically motivated , but are nevertheless a result of the State 's failure in its duty to provide guarantees and to prevent , investigate and punish crime . 
If it was difficult to give proper treatment in an ordinary detention centre , or if a special or a long-term treatment was required , a patient would be sent to special detention institutions where sufficient medical treatment was available .  
First , with respect to educational and vocational training measures , the Act provides that " education and re-education shall , as far as is possible , take place in ordinary educational establishments , or , failing that , in specialized establishments " ( art . 10 ) ; and lays down the general rule that " vocational training of the disabled must give them the capacity to exercise an economic activity enabling them to use their vocational skills and aptitudes " ( art .  11 ) .

Fortunately , the opposing view prevailed , as it would have been rather superfluous and even contradictory to promote human rights monitoring activities at international level in ordinary situations , while at the same time denying their applicability during times of crisis or instability , though aware that it is precisely in such situations that the worst violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms most frequently occur . 
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .

Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
The classroom breakdown and a sharp increase in juvenile crime pained the ordinary folks greatly .  The Aum Supreme Truth 's spreading sarin gas at a Tokyo metro station sent a chill down people 's spines and made them uneasey .  And the impending collapse of the social security system , including the pension fund system , made them feel bleak about their future .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
When the splittists wantonly injured and killed ordinary people , did they have the least bit of national feelings and religious piety ?  Since betraying the motherland and the Tibetan people in 1959 , Dalai as the representative of the backward feudal serfdom , has been engaging in splittist activities outside the borders .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
Try and imagine , the moment a rocket lifts off from earth and shoots into the sky , the tremendous sense of accomplishment and happiness that surges in the hearts of every person involved in space flight when seeing the ever shrinking difference between the level of China 's space flight technology and the most advanced international levels and when seeing the ever increasing international position of China as a result of this is something that is difficult for the ordinary person to understand .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
Tianjin has timely quickened the pace of building ordinary senior high schools in various ways and expanded and rebuilt 16 well-managed high schools , increasing the numbers of students admitted to senior high schools , winning local residents ' favorable comments .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Yang Xueyi , associate research fellow of the " 18 September Historical Museum , " briefed that after the " 18 September Incident , " the Japanese aggressor troops engineered a series of atrocious massacres in Liaoning . On 16 September 1932 , the Japanese army carried out a barbarous policy of burning and killing .  About 3,000 innocent ordinary people living in the neighborhood of Pingding Shan in Fushun were killed and all the houses were burned down .  
Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

During the period while on reserve service , officers are required to receive training for three months ; soldiers of ordinary arms who were once on active service or have gone through the basic training of the militia are required to receive training for one months , while those who have never received any basic training should be trained for an additional month ; and those serving in professional and technical arms are required to receive training for two months , while the training time is relatively longer for those who need to master more sophisticated technologies .  
Through eliminating bad assets and instilling fine assets , some listed companies running in the red or those whose achievements are just ordinary have seen a thoroughgoing change and adopted a new outlook .  Their unpopular stocks , which were originally not in investors ' favor , or their " garbage stocks , " have become hot stocks pursued by the market and have entered the rank of high-price stocks enjoying good sales .  
Some law experts note that because LC fraud involves many middle links , and units and personnel at home and overseas that take part in the fraud are entitled to service charges illegally .  They say that fraud carried out in collusion by lawless elements at home and abroad , while preventing banks from collecting the loans they have extended and increasing their bad debts by geometric progression , is often accompanied by corruption , bribery , and other forms of lawlessness .  Thus its danger to society is even more penetrating and extensive than ordinary crimes .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
Because of influence by the United States ' traditional anti-Communist ideology and China policy , there are fairly strong anti-China forces in the American society , and some public opinions are deeply biased against and hostile to China . Under such an atmosphere , some politicians regarded playing " espionage cases " as the most convenient and effective anti-China tactic and thereupon made Wen Ho Lee , an ordinary scientist , their first target of attack .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
Because of well-developed IT infrastructure and the appearance of many intelligent buildings and wired communities and because net life and information-based consumption are accessible to ordinary citizens , more and more people can experience the virtues of distance learning , distance medical care , digital library , and shopping , house search , stock trading , and sightseeing on cyberspace .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
Strictly speaking , the reason given by this customer for his choice of a commodity may not be scientific enough , yet it does have a strong " humanistic " color , for loving one thing on account of another is only natural to all ordinary people .  
They colluded with Huang Guolin , a dismissed worker of customs , smuggled goods valued at more than $ 88 million , and evaded a tax worth more than 17.6 million yuan .  The judgement was : Fu Zhijian and Huang Guolin committed a crime of smuggling ordinary goods ; they were sentenced to death , and deprived of political rights for life , with their personal property confiscated and turned over to the national treasury .  
We should continue to properly distribute supplementary loans allocated under national debts , and ensure that enterprises - - whose products are saleable , and which are efficient and trustworthy - - can attain current funds needed for their production .  We should be very cautious when considering extending loans for ordinary fixed assets , and pay attention to preventing new and redundant projects in processing industries .  
His conduct constituted crimes of smuggling ordinary goods , accepting bribes , embezzlement , unauthorized partitioning of state-owned assets and possessing large amounts of property of unaccountable origins .  Due to the enormous amount of money involved and the especially serious circumstances , in the judgment of first instance , he was sentenced to death , deprived of political rights for life , and subjected to confiscation of all personal property .  
As pointed out by Regina Ip , the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa is no ordinary organization .  Besides being heretical and making people obsessed , it is also a tightly built organization with strong mobilization power and financial resources and is targeting itself directly at the central authorities .  Its activities have caused public concern , and it is also necessary for the government to pay attention to their activities .  
From the national capital to the most impoverished province of Gansu and from ordinary seminars in various localities to the current annual session of the National People 's Congress , the supreme organ of power , everybody is talking about one thing : " Are you prepared for China 's WTO accession ? "  
After the initial excitement subsided upon hearing Premier Zhu Rongji 's report on the outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which lists " new carrier rocket models , " " high-speed , broad-band information networks , " and " key integrated circuits " as three major high-tech projects that China will give priority to supporting over the next five years , he has been pondering these questions : New carrier rocket models seem to have very little to do with the lives of ordinary people .  Why are we paying so much attention to them ?  
Speaking at a ceremony of the Community Building Project " We Build And We Care " in Tseung Kwan O , he said the Government attached great importance to housing issues , especially on how to help ordinary people own their homes at reasonable and affordable prices .  The ultimate objective was to build a society in which people can live and work in peace and harmony .  Mr Tung said the objective was important in enhancing a sense of belonging to the community and maintaining social stability .  
" As business of captive insurers is restricted to underwriting exclusively general business of its group companies and it is not permitted to engage in statutory insurance businesses like motor and employees ' compensation insurance , captive insurers are subject to a much less stringent regulatory regime than that applicable to ordinary insurers , " he said .  
The paper noted that the existing Indemnity Fund does not compensate clients for money lost by reason of the fraudulent act of solicitors who are sole practitioners or partners of a firm .  Moreover , it compensates clients in respect of a fraud perpetrated by a solicitor 's employee only if the solicitor could have prevented the fraud by exercising ordinary care and skill in the management of the practice .  The paper considered this position to be unsatisfactory .  
Section 19A ( 1 ) provides that , where a provision of an Ordinance is ambiguous or obscure , or its ordinary meaning in the context in which it is used leads to a result that is absurd or unreasonable , then material not forming part of the Ordinance but which is capable of assisting in ascertaining the meaning of the provision ( " extrinsic material " ) , may be considered for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the provision .  
A " non-immunity " clause is normally included in Ordinances establishing a corporation or other body which is empowered to perform public or semi-public functions but which is intended to operate independently of the Government . The " non-immunity " clause makes it clear that the body is independent and ensures that it is treated in law as an ordinary private body .  
Students with moderate to profound hearing impairment and having acquired sufficient language skills are integrated in ordinary classes .  Inspectors of ED visit schools regularly to advise teachers and social workers on how best to support these students .  
" The award winners include a blind acting Chief Executive Officer who has been with the Government for 21 years ; a deaf senior cook who has been working in a hotel for four years ; a Chinese calligraphist who , though without his right arm , can type faster than ordinary people ; and a single-eyed mentally retarded cleaner who participates in voluntary service after work , and has been commended as an outstanding young volunteer . "  
Behind this internationally accepted definition is the consensus that there is a qualitative difference between terrorist acts capable of inflicting massive and indiscriminate injury and damage to the public and ordinary criminal activities , such as criminal damage , assault or even murder . 
In relation to broadcasting , the television and radio Codes of Practice issued by the Broadcasting Authority require licensees to observe at all times certain basic standards in the presentation of programmes , including news broadcasts .  A licensee should not include in its programmes any material that is indecent , obscene , or of bad taste and which is not acceptable to ordinary viewers .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Clear , white , grey , and yellow are the more highly valued colors , while blue and green are considered more ordinary .  
According to Chinese legend , during the T'ang dynasty there were two enlightened holy mee from the sacred Buddhist area of T'ien T'ai mountain , Shih Te and Han Shan . They lived as ordinary monks responsible for the kitchen duties in the Kuo Ch'ing Temple . Speaking to each other in a language unintelligible to others , they were considered crazy by the other monks .

As such tales of discovery go , the development of the wind surfer did not occur in some grandiose manner , but instead , in the ordinary confines of a suburban California garage , some 18 years ago . Two young friends , one an avid surfer , the other a disciple of sailing , were engaged in a friendly debate over the relative merits of their favorite pastimes .  
Halfway up the slope of a mountain on the Chiufen-Shuanghsi road rests a silent wooden workers ' hut . Chiufen resident Lin Hsin-hsiung takes us up a section of road and into the hut . This hut is built next to an unobtrusive and ordinary mine pit opening , and were it not for the gold panning paraphernalia just outside it would be hard to tell that this was indeed a gold mine .  
The sound of the waking clappers is actually very low , which the ordinary people generally can not hear as they sleep . The monks are tranquil and quiet in body and mind ; to them , even a falling twig can be heard , not to mention the clappers .  
The painstaking process of raising them , in which expense is no object , would be inconceivable in ordinary hog raising , which is aimed at economic efficiency , but religious or spiritual values can never be measured in terms of economic efficiency .  
Try and imagine pa-pao fan [ eight treasures rice ] made from ordinary rice . No one would find it fully satisfying , even if it were studded with purple dates or green plums . Nien-kao [ New Year 's cake ] is another sticky food that is fit for eating only when made from glutinous rice .  
These flowers are not the same as common plants because they move about and they are probably five times the size of ordinary plants - - but common plants are no match for the beauty of these migrant plants which are purple , red , blue , yellow , and green colored suns - - their stalks are pretty girls and they float around rootless like duckweed .  
The fourth costume consists of a plain blue dress of the early Republican period reflecting ordinary family life of the time . The fifth costume is a cheongsam , originally worn in the Ch'ing dynasty but still popular today , a typically Chinese style of women 's dress .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
Decoration costs and rising rents were soon reflected in menu prices , and " sometimes their meals were more pricey than any ordinary restaurant . " Mr . Yang maintains that once beer parlors started charging stiff prices and had lost the advantage of novelty all the charm went out of them , their unique atmosphere evaporated and their business started tailing off .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
Some people have criticized the education of gifted children as elitist , as a " gilded lily " taking up valuable educational resources , but Tzeng Su-jung , a doctor of education , disagrees . " If gifted students are put in ordinary classes and wind up with blank expressions all the time because they 've mastered the material , is n't that a form of learning disadvantage , too ? "  
Thinking back to the dictatorial imperial system , " worshipping Heaven " was a special privilege reserved for the Son of Heaven ( the Emperor ) . in the Ching dynasty , there was still the regulation that any ordinary person caught worshipping Heaven directly would be punished with 80 strokes of the rod , so that common folk had no choice but to worship in secret .  
The ordinary teachers are also rigorously tested , attend lessons and write theses . Publishing articles in academic journals is compulsory work and under-taking research occupies at least half the workload . The topics of research are decided from above and there is no autonomy here . " Researchers in national defense have all been through a strict process of selection , " says V . Prudnikov .  
The rise in TB in the U . S . is probably related to the huge increase in AIDS , " says Lin Tao-ping , director of the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau . Once their immune system breaks down , AIDS sufferers are defenseless against communicable diseases . Twenty to 30 percent of them contract tuberculosis , especially atypical forms of the bacillus that ordinary people are not readily susceptible to and which are highly resistant to medication .  
They continually penetrate the soil , eating an amount of soil each day equal to their body weight , while their digestive system is like a factory line sucking in rough earth and waste and producing " night soil beads , " which are superior to bits of ordinary soil . Besides having greater air content , these " night soil beads " also have one third more water and microbes . Earthworm manure is excellent fertilizer .  
An IQ of from 50 to 70 is considered mildly retarded ; the focus of education is similar to that of ordinary children , with more emphasis on practical applied learning . People with IQs from 35 to 50 are classified as moderately retarded , with the focus of education placed on taking care of one 's own daily necessities , communication with others , developing job skills , and basic knowledge .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
In terms of land management , besides continuing the " royal demesne " system , the " garrison field system " was adopted . Under this system , in ordinary times soldiers would farm the land and be self-sufficient . This saved the government money , gave the soldiers land to farm , established a sound foundation for agriculture , and even led to major accomplishments in terms of economic activities important to the daily life of the people ( such as salt and sugar production , water conservancy , and paddy cultivation ) .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
The furo bathroom , with which she is most satisfied , is separate from the main living area , and connects with the storeroom . It does not have an ordinary bathtub , but is dominated by a big traditional wooden tub , which keeps the water warm longer . There is also space for the big kitchen stove and the wood it burns .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
Liang Chiungpai notes that not only do pickled veggies keep well for a long time , they come in many flavors , covering the gamut from sour and salty to sweet and hot ; they also help relieve that bloated feeling . Available to both rich and poor alike , and appropriate for both holidays and ordinary meals , these little appetizers are eminently suited to accompany fine cuisine .  
Song people really played out their penchant for probing things ' inner nature . Not bothered with ordinary flowers Thus categorized by the people of the Song , not only was the plum flower judged the most virtuous of the " noble four " of the black plum , the orchid , the bamboo and the chrysanthemum-the names of its cousins the peach , the Japanese plum , the cherry and the almond were all blackened .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
The brutal murder of an ordinary postgraduate student at a prestigious university , in a research institute building with access restricted by the use of a magnetic card reader , shocked the public and aroused the special concern of the police .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
In an ordinary class there are too many students to do any activities , and you 're stuck with traditional teaching methods . In order to keep things moving along , it is n't possible to look after the needs of students who fall behind . But in the experimental class , students are divided into four groups according to ability , with no more than eight students in each group . Every student has a chance to speak , and students of different abilities can be brought along at their own pace , and not abandoned .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
In contrast to the solemn chanting heard in temples and monasteries , this new melodic , orchestral form made for good background music at places of worship , where it enhanced the atmosphere of devotion . It also found favor with ordinary believers , who could play it at home while cooking , eating and doing their chores , confident that Buddha would n't be offended .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
The main protagonists : a young , runaway unmarried mother , and her older brother-the director-who films the documentary . How will they deal with the events that upset the ordinary pattern of family life ? How will family members react to these crises ? And how will they overcome their mutual misunderstandings to recreate a harmonious and happy family atmosphere ?  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World .

Chu Bong-foo says he first conceived Cosmic Drifter in 1998 . The ideas came from his previously published Nine Essays On Intelligence , in which he discusses thought , human nature and value in terms of energy conversion , the formation of matter , the nature of time and space , and the evolution of the universe . But the essays ' content was dry and dull , and nobody understood it . Therefore he wanted to turn his theories into a popular novel that ordinary people would understand .  
The contents of the exhibit can be divided into four categories . First are the splendid and ornate gold and silver pieces of the Tang dynasty royal family , followed by the tricolor glaze pottery and ceramic pieces that were used by the ordinary folk of that time . Then there are the Buddhist and Taoist statues that evoke the Tang 's flourishing and diverse religious environment .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature .

With the adoption of such detailed forms , throughout society a new body language took shape that expressed degrees of authority . You can still see this in the body language of older people .  
Because , in the eyes of an ordinary person , their abilities border on pure magic . A painter uses a brush , a bit of ink , and a few colors to create a world beyond anything we could imagine . A poet takes the words we all learned in elementary school and writes them into verses that people recite for centuries . Musicians compose simple sounds into musical pieces that are played for generations .  
In terms of literary value , Wang Dan 's essays do not come up to the same level as his poetry . But for the ordinary reader , in contrast to the more obscure poems the essays seem to offer a more accessible point of entry for understanding the soul of the exile . This is despite the fact that it is quite obvious that Wang carefully works to preserve his private space .  
In the eyes of the Japanese colonial authorities , Chiang was Public Enemy No . 1 . Among Taiwanese intellectuals , he was widely recognized as a pioneer . And among ordinary citizens he was revered as a charismatic leader , a guiding force for cultural renaissance and a dedicated opponent of the injustices of the colonial regime .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless .

Of more far-ranging significance is the fact that the issue of political status has now been dubbed too complicated , too confusing and too separated from the everyday issues of economic , political and social life to be of any moment to the ordinary resident of the Territory .  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .
