He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
Zhang Changli 's case of illegally soliciting deposits from the public was an economic crime that severely violated the state financial administration system and disrupted the financial order , incurring enormous losses of state , collective , and personal property .  
After the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , the party 's second generation of leading collective with Deng Xiaoping at the core put forward the great goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , adhered to the party 's basic line of one center and two basic points , and scored achievements that attracted worldwide attention .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
at the same time , an individual 's responsibilities and duties for the collective and the state are stressed ; all people are encouraged to care about the overall interests of the nation , be honest and keep their promises , be united and help each other , be enthusiastic for public benefits , and do more good things for the people and for society .  
Although this report describes only a small portion of the tragic but sublime stories about this heroic collective , we can still clearly perceive how red and how grand and beautiful the flag is , flying atop the roof of the world .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
Standing committee members will take action to organize its implementation within the scope of their responsibilities .  The municipal party committee will supervise and inspect the implementation , and will coordinate and solve problems at a good time .  Thus , persistently integrating collective leadership with individual responsibility through the division of work plays a positive role in ensuring that the municipal party committee can effectively control the overall situation and coordinate the work of all quarters concerned when handling all major affairs of the whole city and acting as the core of leadership .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .  Thanks to its successful development , our country has entered the world 's advanced ranks in major meteorological application , and has become one of a few countries in the world to perform collective forecasts .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .

The achievements of the " Ninth 5-Year Plan " have been attained on the basis of the rapid developments of reform and opening up , which are not easily won .  They can fully demonstrate the super leading part of the Party 's third generation collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in mastering the overall macroscopic situation , handling various complicated situations , and leading the people of the whole country to advance in a pioneering spirit .  
We should investigate and take actions against any leading cadre or any leading collective that has committed dereliction of duty in the building of a sound party style and clean administration and in anti-corruption work ; and if an individual leading cadre is found to be responsible , we should never allow anyone to shirk the responsibility on the excuse of collective responsibility , still less allow such a situation wherein no one is held responsible .  
Each member of a leading body must be given explicit tasks and be subject to a well-defined scope of functions and duties .  Thus , no one is allowed to pass the buck irresponsibly or shift the blame onto others , and collective leadership can be properly combined with individual responsibilities in the division of work .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core , as a faithful , reliable , enterprising and promising successor to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping , has been leading the people of all nationalities cross the country in working hard together , keeping forging ahead and exerting themselves to make the country prosperous .

Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .

Besides , it is also right and proper for " those who owe more to repay more ; " moreover , under the Kyoto Protocol , developing countries also accept the responsibility for curbing climatic change according to the principle of " collective but differentiated responsibility . "  The United States must not stare fixedly at the chimneys in other countries while turning a blind eye to the smoke surging from the far more numerous chimneys at home .  
The industrial value added continued to increase at a comparatively high rate .  The growth rate in the industrial sectors under state ownership or with dominating shares held by the state was higher than that in the same period of last year , and the rate of their contributions to overall economic growth was also raised .  However , the industrial sector under collective ownership grew at a relatively slower pace , and the growth rate of light industry was markedly lower than that of heavy industry .

During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
After the invasion of terrorists into southern Kyrgyzstan last year , it was a member of the " Shanghai Five " that first provided political , military and technical assistance to the country .

The key lies in guaranteeing that the two major mechanisms for adjusting labor relations , namely , the workers ' congresses and the signing of collective labor contracts on the basis of equal consultation , will really play a proper role .  Attention should not only be paid to the procedures and forms , but should be paid to the actual results .  We should see whether the work in such fields really achieves positive results or not .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .

Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture .

Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors .

Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment .

If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions . The most important reform envisaged under the new system is the change from a collective retirement fund account opened by the firm , to an individual account for each worker .  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience . This she achieves by inviting contributions from over 30 persons from all walks of life who have played prominent roles in the gay movement over the past decade . By allowing each writer their own individual perspective , the book avoids the difficulties of historiography while providing students of social movements with a rigorous yet creative presentation of the facts .  
The heavily attended concert included both ancient and modern music . The " collective memories " exhibition , with pictures from Wufeng displayed on the exterior wall of the lower compound of the Estate , was very moving . The arts market , the tone of which was dominated by traditional and folk crafts , had a constant stream of visitors . Through this event it seems that the people of Wufeng reclaimed some of their happy memories of the past .  
Luo Ta-you penned the song 's music , including its simple , fluid melody . The lyrics , meanwhile , represented the collective effort of a group that included Luo , Lee Shou-chuan , Chang Ta-chun , Sylvia Chang , Chiu Fu-sheng , and Jan Hung-tze . The standard of artistry achieved in the song fully reflected the contributions of the writers , musicians , and media magnates who had played a part in its creation .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
In the process , concepts such as multiculturalism , individual worth , and freedom as supreme have taken root throughout Taiwan . Dreams of democratization are the binding thread , bringing all these individualistic dreams together , while Taiwan 's past dreams of power are refined into a collective goal of economic development .  
Somewhat over a decade ago , Brother Hotel owner Hung Teng-sheng , amidst widespread skepticism , played midwife to the birth of pro ball , and laid a foundation for its success . This resolute , quiet man , now known as the " Father of Pro Baseball , " is ensconced in the collective memory of the older generation of fans .  
Society sighs and shakes it collective head at this subgroup , which consists of disadvantaged individuals , often unemployed and / or single parents , stuck on the lower rungs both socially and economically . When faced with injustice or adversity , they often do not know how to express their emotions or where to seek help . These lonely , helpless , marginalized individuals are most vulnerable to anger-whether as its wielders or its victims .  
The Pan Kung gate is the outermost gate of the temple , but during their occupation of Taiwan the Japanese split the gate from the rest of the temple structure when they built Nanmen Road between them . Since the gate was split from the temple proper , its real purpose has gradually faded from collective memory , so it 's not surprising so few people realize it 's actually part of the temple .  
It may refer to the total of the future doses committed by that source or unit of practice , as for instance , the collective effective dose committed by atmospheric nuclear explosions or by one year of medical exposures .  
If the probability of late effects is proportional to effective dose at low doses , which is probably the case , the collective effective dose is an indicator of the total attributable harm to be expected in that group and its descendants .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of a collective consciousness , the expansion of a shared system of values , an international citizenship based on common , objective interests and the spread of more uniform lifestyles .  
The concepts of collective security , fundamental human rights , international law and social progress for all are being corroded by ethnocentrism , isolationism , cultural animosity and economic and social debilitation .  
It meets annually , at the Heads of Government level , to develop collective responses on a wide range of regional issues , including trade , economic development , civil aviation and maritime issues , telecommunications , energy and political and security matters .  
In other words , " collective responsibility " a primitive and archaic concept will gain the upper hand ; eventually whole groups will be held guilty of massacres , torture , rape , ethnic cleansing , the wanton destruction of cities and villages .  
" In making social issues a universal priority " , as the Secretary-General pointed out at the recently held World Summit for Social Development , " our intention is to take responsibility for the collective future of international society and to pledge ourselves anew to the ideal of global solidarity " .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
This Organization was brought into being by the vision , the hope and the determination of men and women who experienced at first hand the lethal dangers of nationalism , economic depression , lost freedom and devastating war men and women who realized the need to create mechanisms that would allow States to embark upon a collective effort in dealing with a wide range of complex international issues .  
With the Second World War barely over , the international community of that time sought to establish a world organization which would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by instituting a system of collective security based on the repudiation of the use of force save in the common interest , and on the basic principles of sovereign equality , freedom , justice and the rule of law .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
The main lesson of this landmark experience is obvious the way to the survival and prosperity of the world is through the cohesion and collective efforts of all constructive forces and through the decisive resolution of minor differences for the sake of common paramount interests and goals .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
In this context , a pragmatic , realistic and egalitarian formula should be sought in the sum total of national sovereignties , merged into a collective , or continental , sovereignty .  
Indeed , 50 years after its founding , and facing the continuing economic and financial crisis that gravely undermines individual and collective development efforts and is a destabilizing factor for young States and for international peace and security , the United Nations is duty-bound to play a more active , indeed a central , role in promoting economic , social and cultural cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter .  
Moreover , the shared approaches that have characterized these last few years do not in themselves resolve many of the substantive problems of the international system , such as those pertaining to collective security , economic and social development and the defence of the perennial values that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life for peoples and individuals .  
Proceeding from this , it is only by improving the collective capabilities of the international community to face up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices that a true meaning could be given to preventive efforts of diplomacy , to peace-keeping operations and to the elaboration of a genuine structure of international cooperation .  
This is an imaginative , promotive , contemporary and fair State that respects economic , political and social balance and makes room for individual and collective creativity in society .  
To deal with these problems is a political , social and ethical imperative for us all that requires a collective approach , both national and international , on the basis of a new understanding of cooperation , equality , tolerance and respect for the customs and beliefs of different societies .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .

The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .  This requires thinking in terms of grand strategies and great enterprises , with emphasis on realistic visions .  
It is possible clearly to visualize the possibility of identifying , within a social network , joint projects in such critical areas as , for example , the production of strategic information , the cooperative search for financing sources and collective negotiation of financing , the training of specialized human resources and the setting of quality standards in the evaluation of social programmes .

Comparisons of findings with written texts and subsequent modifications to the texts based on the students ' individual and collective experiences with the actual situations not only encourage reality-based interaction with those outside the school environment , but also encourage students to treat texts as modifiable entities instead of final authorities .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
FAO regards South-South cooperation as a key element in the developing countries ' search for collective self-reliance and an essential contribution to the necessary structural changes required for a balanced and equitable process of world economic development .

Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Our collective reflection clearly revealed that , without the United Nations , the world would only have been more violent , more unstable and insecure , more unjust and cruel especially to the weak , who are prey to power politics and arbitrary decisions .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .

After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
" Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,

The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
We consider such blockade and closure as tantamount to the declaration of a state of war against the Palestinian people , a people that have chosen the road of peace but that for more than a month have been subjected to the worst and most unjust form of collective punishment , to say nothing of the starvation of children , women and the elderly and contempt for basic rights that should be respected in the same manner as human rights in all countries of the world .

The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
The collective goal of the former colonial Powers was to continue controlling the former colonies in order to guarantee a continuous flow of inexpensive raw materials and cheap labour while at the same time ensuring a stable market for goods from the industrially developed countries .

In other words , accepting this as the sole parameter would be tantamount to recognizing the domination of the Security Council by a small group of rich and mighty countries and would be contrary to the profound aspiration of the international community to establishing a system of collective security in which a reformed , modernized and more democratic Security Council would fully take into account , with efficiency and transparency , the preoccupations and needs of all States , regardless of their size , level of development or economic conditions .  
Three critical factors would allow UNHCR to fulfil its role in ever more complex environments : respect must be ensured for its unique mandate of refugee protection ; a collective commitment to respond to emergencies and resolve humanitarian crises was essential ; and it was vital that UNHCR was fully equipped to carry out its mission .  
The majority of the Member States wanted the Organization to give effect to the principles that had prompted them to join the United Nations , as reaffirmed by the Heads of State at the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , namely international security and peace based on an effective system of collective security , on economic and social development , on justice and on the sovereign equality of States .  
Lastly , the pay-offs through greater mutual understanding and confidence gained in subregional economic cooperation and factor mobility may be intangible , but they generate substantial positive , highly visible and collective external benefits for ED , networking and integration among the collaborating or participating countries in the long run .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
We believe , and it was also indicated in the discussions and the final declaration of the conference , that the Tehran conference provided a unique opportunity for participants to express their collective support for the ongoing peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and to send a strong signal to the warring factions in Afghanistan that the countries in the region totally reject the vicious circle of war and violence in Afghanistan .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
Secondly , it would require education for solidarity , in order to ensure , as a fundamental prerequisite for collective harmony , the permanent integration of our peoples on a solid basis of personal and national self-esteem , an education in which the principle of shared responsibility is increasingly strengthened in the minds and hearts of citizens .  
The brilliant and forward-looking authors of the Charter of the United Nations and the rest of us who are the beneficiaries of their collective wisdom and imagination have reason to hope for a firm consolidation of a democratic , stable and compassionate world order that would make a clear break with the past , characterized by two unprecedented and most destructive wars in this century .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
Several targets are put forward , including promoting the ratification of ILO conventions ; establishing bipartite and tripartite mechanisms on safety , health and sustainable development ; increasing the number of environmental collective agreements ; reducing occupational accidents and injuries ; and increasing workers ' education and training efforts by the year 2000 . 
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
The central collective leadership , with President Jiang Zemin at its core , will lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the behest of Mr . Deng Xiaoping , advancing the great cause pioneered by him : building China into a prosperous , democratic and civilized socialist country , and developing friendly relations of cooperation with all countries in the world , thus making more , and greater , contributions to peace , development and the progress of mankind .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
We continue to draw vital sustenance from what is , after all , a West Indian partnership rooted in a shared love for , and practice of , democracy , a democracy that is not resting on its laurels , but that is engaged now in a process of revitalization based on the urgent search for collective economic security and social advance .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
Terrorism , drug trafficking , cross-border crime , the depletion of the ozone layer , acid rain , receding rain forests , advancing deserts , diminishing fresh-water reserves , poverty , disease and many more recognize no national boundaries ; only collective action by the States Members of the Organization can arrest and reverse their advance .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
This draft resolution accepts my proposal to establish a development dividend funded by administrative savings , thereby reaffirming our collective commitment to the instrumental objective of efficiency as well as the substantive priority of economic and social development .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
Second , specific structures in the economy and labour market , such as persistent occupational segregation and concentration , discrimination in pay , limited representation of women in economic decision-making and collective bargaining structures , and other implicit or explicit policies exclude women from certain economic activities and reinforce their subordination in labour markets .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
Given the central importance of Jerusalem to the Palestinian people , to the entire Arab and Muslim nation , to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and to the international community as a whole , the Council 's inaction stands in stark contrast to the collective position of the international community , as reflected in the Council , the great potential damage of Israel 's decision , its impact on the Middle East peace process , and the great harm wrought by the failure of the Council to adopt this draft resolution .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The extended closings of the West Bank and Gaza with the resulting disastrous economic consequences , the progressive isolation of Palestinians from access to Jerusalem , the establishment and expansion of settlements , the denial of access to refugees and the endless incarceration of prisoners , among other issues , have indelibly marked our hearts and stirred our collective sense of determination to persist in this work .  
He called on the international community to condemn measures taken by the occupying Power in the occupied territories ; many of them were tantamount to collective punishment , had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the inhabitants , and were not only illegal but inhuman .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
Aware and convinced that the survival of humanity is a collective responsibility , we decided in Rio to establish a new kind of partnership built of common yet differentiated responsibility in order to promote national , regional and world cooperation for development that we wished to be sustainable .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
The practices and procedures outlined above have a negative impact on the economic , social and cultural rights of individuals and also on collective or communal rights ( right to development and right to a healthy environment ) .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
Furthermore , the report of the Secretary _ General stressed , in paragraph 23 , the persistent violation of the Israeli occupation authorities of the principles of international law , concerning administrative detention of Palestinians and the ill _ treatment and torture to which Palestinians are subjected , in accordance with an official decision made by the High Court and the Government of Israel , in addition to imposing collective punishments on Palestinians , among which is the demolition of houses in Jerusalem and in other regions of the occupied territory .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
The report dwells on the managerial role played by the existing instruments designed to provide collective guidance and advice to management and considers them to be cumbersome , to cause delays where promptness is required and to dilute responsibility .  
On a collective basis , symbolic measures intended to provide moral reparation , such as formal public recognition by the State of its responsibility , or official declarations aimed at restoring victims ' dignity , commemorative ceremonies , naming of public thoroughfares or the erection of monuments , help to discharge the duty of remembrance .  
We , the representatives of the international community , can not , at this historical juncture , ignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory that runs counter to the common work and collective obligations we agreed upon for international life .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
BAHAMONDES ( Canada ) said that the efforts of the United Nations to eradicate poverty constituted both a moral imperative and a collective undertaking with a direct bearing on the interests of all countries , rich and poor alike .  
The paragraphs on which a separate vote had been taken contained political elements which were not appropriate in a financing resolution and violated long-standing budgetary principles for peacekeeping operations based on collective responsibility .  
His Government supported the rights-based approach insofar as it implied that both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights were inherent to the individual or the collective rather than conferred by an act of welfare or charity .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
Regarding the definition of injured State contained in article 40 , clarification is needed with respect to the phrase the right has been created or is established for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in paragraph 2 ( e ) ( iii ) , and the phrase for the protection of the collective interests of the State parties thereto in paragraph 2 ( f ) .  What is intended in article 42 , paragraph 2 , and article 43 , subparagraph ( d ) , is not defined clearly .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The United Arab Emirates , which considered Israels actions to be unlawful , strongly condemned Israels arbitrary rule and immoral acts : collective punishment , the blockade of towns and villages , the profanation of Muslim sacred objects and places of worship , violence and the arbitrary detention and murder of innocent , peaceful inhabitants , including women and children . 
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
To counter the perceived threat and build a " clean social system " , 2 the regime launched a uniquely thorough revolution whereby all pre-existing economic , social and cultural institutions were abolished , all foreign influences were expunged and the entire population was transformed into a collective workforce , required to work at breakneck speed to build up the country 's economic strength .  
The employed person 's salary is augmented in case of work in conditions which are more difficult than normal for a particular job ( climate , noise , vibrations , irradiation , humidity , harmful gases , biologically harmful substances , physical strain , work with dirty materials , danger caused by tools or objects , means of transport , waste materials , electricity , explosions , heat , corrosive materials , etc . ) , which need to be made specific by special or individual collective agreements .  
The Constitution of FRY establishes that employed persons are entitled to limited working hours , daily and weekly rest , paid annual vacation and absence in accordance with the law , i.e . the collective agreement .  
South / South cooperation , including TCDC and ECDC , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their more effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system .  
Refrain from any interference , direct or indirect , individual or collective , in internal and external affairs falling within the national competence of individual States , regardless of their mutual relations , and that they shall refrain from any form of armed intervention or threat with armed intervention against another member State , as well as from undertaking political economic or other coercion ;  
Following current practice in cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
Stresses that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance , as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy , and that it is not a substitute for but rather is complementary to North-South cooperation ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
In a shared vision , the United Nations system should aim to work for a world in which HIV / AIDS transmission is substantially reduced ; where there is affordable treatment , care and support ; where there is a substantial reduction in individual and collective vulnerability to HIV / AIDS ; where there is a significant alleviation of the adverse impact of the epidemic on individuals , communities , and nations ; and where stigma and denial are addressed .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
They were also the subject of the working paper prepared for the fifth session by Mr . Mehedi , who concluded that such education must have two facets : on the one hand , preservation of collective identity accompanied by acceptance of diversity as an asset and , on the other hand , universal education leading to understanding and tolerance . 
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .

The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 20 May 1996 confirmed the exceptional and temporary nature of the oil-for-food programme which was intended to provide for the most urgent humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people who were subjected to collective punishment through the most vile regime of comprehensive sanctions in history .  
The Government is anxious to see the potential for voluntary repatriation maximized and would like to see the existing camps closed prior to the winter period and the remaining refugees transferred to alternative accommodation in collective centres and / or host families .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
This is a professional body that is trained to focus on the protection and defence of the individual and collective rights of citizens and is sensitive to , and respectful of , ethnic , cultural and linguistic diversities . 
Of course , evolution of the international situation means that it is appropriate for existing rules of international law to be developed and adapted to prevailing conditions , but this should be done through collective discussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions , not as a fait accompli and not working from scratch : it should be based on valid rules of international law .  
It would be particularly dangerous , under the pretext of exorcising painful emotions or absolving the international community of its past inaction or its inability now and in the future to prevent or settle crises , to risk acting without the consent of a State , or even against its desire , with excesses as serious as regrettable endangering the collective security system so painstakingly built around the Security Council .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .  
In order to ensure that it can contribute to laying the foundations for enduring and coherent development , intensified international cooperation as well as countries = own national and collective efforts will be essential to address effectively the shortcomings of the external environment and the constraints of underdevelopment .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;

Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .

However , the special nature and complexity of transnational organized crime demands that the collective legal thinking of States should be challenged to find ways to prevent such differences from impeding effective action .

Recognizing the need for deepening its collective analysis of the many interrelated dimensions of globalization and their implications for the work of the system , ACC continued its reflection during 2000 on the impact of globalization , focusing at its first regular session , on the interrelationships between trade and economic , social and environmental dimensions and on the issue of information technology ( see ACC / 2000 / 4 ) .  
The collective capacities of the system need to be harnessed to enrich and expand the knowledge base required nationally as well as internationally to broaden perspectives , act to address potential conflicts such as between trade rules and global , social and environmental goals , and maximize mutual reinforcement among policies and actions in different sectors in support of poverty eradication and development .  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin .

The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .  
However , it must always be borne in mind that the task is complicated by the fact that it is not merely a question of combating laws , regulations and policies , but also of combating cultural practices that are rooted in collective memory and in the deep ancestral beliefs of people , including women themselves , and that , sometimes these harmful practices , although often contrary to religions , are perpetuated in the name of religion , or imputed to religion .

He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
Informal processes may take various forms , ranging from a completely informal process based upon non-binding principles which support a collective negotiating framework and do not involve the judicial system ( although relying on the existence of an efficient and effective formal system for leverage ) , to those which utilize a judicial administration mechanism to enforce a plan reached by informal negotiations and to bind creditors to that plan .  
I would imagine that we would also agree that it was proper that this Conference should be held in South Africa , a country that has witnessed the most egregious form of institutionalized racism , yet rose to become a living testimony that racism can be defeated with the collective efforts of the international community .  Gathered at this Conference , as Member States , we have at some time or another stood at the precipice .

While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
Zhang Changli 's case of illegally soliciting deposits from the public was an economic crime that severely violated the state financial administration system and disrupted the financial order , incurring enormous losses of state , collective , and personal property .  
After the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , the party 's second generation of leading collective with Deng Xiaoping at the core put forward the great goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , adhered to the party 's basic line of one center and two basic points , and scored achievements that attracted worldwide attention .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
at the same time , an individual 's responsibilities and duties for the collective and the state are stressed ; all people are encouraged to care about the overall interests of the nation , be honest and keep their promises , be united and help each other , be enthusiastic for public benefits , and do more good things for the people and for society .  
Although this report describes only a small portion of the tragic but sublime stories about this heroic collective , we can still clearly perceive how red and how grand and beautiful the flag is , flying atop the roof of the world .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
Standing committee members will take action to organize its implementation within the scope of their responsibilities .  The municipal party committee will supervise and inspect the implementation , and will coordinate and solve problems at a good time .  Thus , persistently integrating collective leadership with individual responsibility through the division of work plays a positive role in ensuring that the municipal party committee can effectively control the overall situation and coordinate the work of all quarters concerned when handling all major affairs of the whole city and acting as the core of leadership .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .  Thanks to its successful development , our country has entered the world 's advanced ranks in major meteorological application , and has become one of a few countries in the world to perform collective forecasts .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
The achievements of the " Ninth 5-Year Plan " have been attained on the basis of the rapid developments of reform and opening up , which are not easily won .  They can fully demonstrate the super leading part of the Party 's third generation collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in mastering the overall macroscopic situation , handling various complicated situations , and leading the people of the whole country to advance in a pioneering spirit .  
We should investigate and take actions against any leading cadre or any leading collective that has committed dereliction of duty in the building of a sound party style and clean administration and in anti-corruption work ; and if an individual leading cadre is found to be responsible , we should never allow anyone to shirk the responsibility on the excuse of collective responsibility , still less allow such a situation wherein no one is held responsible .  
Each member of a leading body must be given explicit tasks and be subject to a well-defined scope of functions and duties .  Thus , no one is allowed to pass the buck irresponsibly or shift the blame onto others , and collective leadership can be properly combined with individual responsibilities in the division of work .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core , as a faithful , reliable , enterprising and promising successor to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping , has been leading the people of all nationalities cross the country in working hard together , keeping forging ahead and exerting themselves to make the country prosperous .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .

With the Second World War barely over , the international community of that time sought to establish a world organization which would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by instituting a system of collective security based on the repudiation of the use of force save in the common interest , and on the basic principles of sovereign equality , freedom , justice and the rule of law .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
The main lesson of this landmark experience is obvious the way to the survival and prosperity of the world is through the cohesion and collective efforts of all constructive forces and through the decisive resolution of minor differences for the sake of common paramount interests and goals .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security . 
In this context , a pragmatic , realistic and egalitarian formula should be sought in the sum total of national sovereignties , merged into a collective , or continental , sovereignty .  
Indeed , 50 years after its founding , and facing the continuing economic and financial crisis that gravely undermines individual and collective development efforts and is a destabilizing factor for young States and for international peace and security , the United Nations is duty-bound to play a more active , indeed a central , role in promoting economic , social and cultural cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter .  
Moreover , the shared approaches that have characterized these last few years do not in themselves resolve many of the substantive problems of the international system , such as those pertaining to collective security , economic and social development and the defence of the perennial values that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life for peoples and individuals .  
Proceeding from this , it is only by improving the collective capabilities of the international community to face up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices that a true meaning could be given to preventive efforts of diplomacy , to peace-keeping operations and to the elaboration of a genuine structure of international cooperation .  
This is an imaginative , promotive , contemporary and fair State that respects economic , political and social balance and makes room for individual and collective creativity in society .  
To deal with these problems is a political , social and ethical imperative for us all that requires a collective approach , both national and international , on the basis of a new understanding of cooperation , equality , tolerance and respect for the customs and beliefs of different societies .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
The establishment of a strategy calling for a supple and coherent approach in relationships of partnership between NATO , the European Union , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations , where each has its own responsibilities , powers and ways of operating , is of vital importance to the entire matter of Euro-Atlantic security , with beneficial effects for the entire collective security system based on the United Nations Charter .  
A projection of collective and global resource requirements , presented by the organizations to their respective governing body , based on approved and planned programmes , taking into account the needs of developing countries , their absorptive capacity , the themes and programmes of action agreed at world conferences and other forums , and the ability of the organization to deliver the proposed programmes ;  
We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values .  
The national policy on HIV / AIDS stressed the individual and collective responsibility of all for AIDS control activities and was directed at both prevention and active management of all the perceived consequences of the epidemic .

The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .  This requires thinking in terms of grand strategies and great enterprises , with emphasis on realistic visions .  
It is possible clearly to visualize the possibility of identifying , within a social network , joint projects in such critical areas as , for example , the production of strategic information , the cooperative search for financing sources and collective negotiation of financing , the training of specialized human resources and the setting of quality standards in the evaluation of social programmes .  
From the first radio call by the voluntary police , who in turn activated the national satellite communications system , to the voluntary response of neighbours who searched through the rubble for injured victims , reports document that individuals and groups initiated collective action based upon the information immediately available .  
Comparisons of findings with written texts and subsequent modifications to the texts based on the students ' individual and collective experiences with the actual situations not only encourage reality-based interaction with those outside the school environment , but also encourage students to treat texts as modifiable entities instead of final authorities .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
FAO regards South-South cooperation as a key element in the developing countries ' search for collective self-reliance and an essential contribution to the necessary structural changes required for a balanced and equitable process of world economic development .  
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
In the Code of Conduct , the collective membership of SACB also agreed that international assistance to Somalia is founded on the basic principle that responsibility for its effective execution shall remain with the Somali people and that responsible Somali authorities are therefore expected to assume their proper role to ensure that conditions exist for the effective implementation of aid activities .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;

The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
It is our hope that the international community , represented by the General Assembly , will fulfil its collective responsibility and put an immediate end to the ongoing aggression , prevail upon Israel to implement United Nations resolutions , especially Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , and pay adequate compensation for human losses and the physical damage to Lebanese institutions , historical sites and service facilities .  
In closing , let me say that my delegation looks forward to close collaboration with you , Sir , and all other members over the next year to advance a collective vision of a truly representative , effective and united United Nations for the twenty-first century .  
This choice constitutes clear recognition of his exceptional personal qualities and his wealth of experience as a seasoned diplomat , and it is a collective tribute to his beautiful country , Malaysia , whose dynamism and outstanding economic success over the past few years I salute .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
Responsibility for social development is based on two pivotal factors : national responsibility and collective commitment , as reflected in the combined efforts of the international community .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Our collective reflection clearly revealed that , without the United Nations , the world would only have been more violent , more unstable and insecure , more unjust and cruel especially to the weak , who are prey to power politics and arbitrary decisions .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
However , the economy of the territory has not changed and the occupying authority , Israel , is continuing its old practices , which are incompatible with international law and local custom , including unjustified detention , blockades , collective punishment and the expansion of existing settlements .  
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
" Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
We consider such blockade and closure as tantamount to the declaration of a state of war against the Palestinian people , a people that have chosen the road of peace but that for more than a month have been subjected to the worst and most unjust form of collective punishment , to say nothing of the starvation of children , women and the elderly and contempt for basic rights that should be respected in the same manner as human rights in all countries of the world . 
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
" Persons of Viet-Nam origin aged more than eighteen at the date of coming into operation of the present Convention , and who have acquired French nationality prior to 8 March 1949 either by individual or collective administrative measure or by judicial decision shall retain French nationality with the right to opt for Viet-Nam nationality under the provisions laid down by the present Convention .

" 
Such steps included : lifting the blockade on the Palestinian territories ; refraining from violating the terms of the bilateral agreements including the imposition of collective punishment in violation of international humanitarian law ; redeploying Israeli forces from Hebron ; establishing a corridor between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which would ensure contacts between the Palestinian territories ; releasing all Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons ; and pressing forward with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Area B on the West Bank .  
Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
By a letter dated 22 March 1991 ( S / 22382 ) , the representatives of the 20 States and Jordan submitted to the President of the Security Council a collective memorandum , in which they stated , inter alia , that : " The problems affecting these countries persist , and in certain respects have been aggravated , while the appeals launched pursuant to the recommendations of the Security Council Committee and addressed to all concerned by the Secretary-General have not evoked responses commensurate with the urgent needs of the affected countries . "  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .  
The collective goal of the former colonial Powers was to continue controlling the former colonies in order to guarantee a continuous flow of inexpensive raw materials and cheap labour while at the same time ensuring a stable market for goods from the industrially developed countries .  
That procedure is established in the collective agreements , with a view to protecting the worker ( requiring him to appear before a Disciplinary Council consisting of an equal number of the employer 's and workers ' representatives , and according him the right to present his defence in a written statement and to be assisted at the Disciplinary Council by a worker of his choice or by a representative of his trade union , and by lawyers ) .  
The commonly accepted definition of a standard is the result of well-reasoned collective choice designed to serve as the basis of understanding for the solution of recurring problems ; a standard represents a balance between the requirements of users and workers and between the technological and social possibilities of these two groups and the public interest which the authorities must safeguard .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .

Foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State in which proceeding the asset and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court or other competent authority , for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation [ provided that the debts were not incurred predominantly for household or other personal rather than commercial purposes ] ;  
The outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women had met the desire of the international community for a comprehensive programme of collective international action to change the prevailing situation of women in many parts of the world while taking account of the religious concepts and principles and the spiritual values that played a major role in the lives of peoples and in ensuring their stability .  
In other words , accepting this as the sole parameter would be tantamount to recognizing the domination of the Security Council by a small group of rich and mighty countries and would be contrary to the profound aspiration of the international community to establishing a system of collective security in which a reformed , modernized and more democratic Security Council would fully take into account , with efficiency and transparency , the preoccupations and needs of all States , regardless of their size , level of development or economic conditions .  
Three critical factors would allow UNHCR to fulfil its role in ever more complex environments : respect must be ensured for its unique mandate of refugee protection ; a collective commitment to respond to emergencies and resolve humanitarian crises was essential ; and it was vital that UNHCR was fully equipped to carry out its mission .  
The majority of the Member States wanted the Organization to give effect to the principles that had prompted them to join the United Nations , as reaffirmed by the Heads of State at the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , namely international security and peace based on an effective system of collective security , on economic and social development , on justice and on the sovereign equality of States .

Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;

We believe , and it was also indicated in the discussions and the final declaration of the conference , that the Tehran conference provided a unique opportunity for participants to express their collective support for the ongoing peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and to send a strong signal to the warring factions in Afghanistan that the countries in the region totally reject the vicious circle of war and violence in Afghanistan .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
Secondly , it would require education for solidarity , in order to ensure , as a fundamental prerequisite for collective harmony , the permanent integration of our peoples on a solid basis of personal and national self-esteem , an education in which the principle of shared responsibility is increasingly strengthened in the minds and hearts of citizens .  
The brilliant and forward-looking authors of the Charter of the United Nations and the rest of us who are the beneficiaries of their collective wisdom and imagination have reason to hope for a firm consolidation of a democratic , stable and compassionate world order that would make a clear break with the past , characterized by two unprecedented and most destructive wars in this century .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
Several targets are put forward , including promoting the ratification of ILO conventions ; establishing bipartite and tripartite mechanisms on safety , health and sustainable development ; increasing the number of environmental collective agreements ; reducing occupational accidents and injuries ; and increasing workers ' education and training efforts by the year 2000 . 
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
The central collective leadership , with President Jiang Zemin at its core , will lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the behest of Mr . Deng Xiaoping , advancing the great cause pioneered by him : building China into a prosperous , democratic and civilized socialist country , and developing friendly relations of cooperation with all countries in the world , thus making more , and greater , contributions to peace , development and the progress of mankind .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
We continue to draw vital sustenance from what is , after all , a West Indian partnership rooted in a shared love for , and practice of , democracy , a democracy that is not resting on its laurels , but that is engaged now in a process of revitalization based on the urgent search for collective economic security and social advance .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
Terrorism , drug trafficking , cross-border crime , the depletion of the ozone layer , acid rain , receding rain forests , advancing deserts , diminishing fresh-water reserves , poverty , disease and many more recognize no national boundaries ; only collective action by the States Members of the Organization can arrest and reverse their advance .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
This draft resolution accepts my proposal to establish a development dividend funded by administrative savings , thereby reaffirming our collective commitment to the instrumental objective of efficiency as well as the substantive priority of economic and social development .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
Second , specific structures in the economy and labour market , such as persistent occupational segregation and concentration , discrimination in pay , limited representation of women in economic decision-making and collective bargaining structures , and other implicit or explicit policies exclude women from certain economic activities and reinforce their subordination in labour markets .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
Given the central importance of Jerusalem to the Palestinian people , to the entire Arab and Muslim nation , to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and to the international community as a whole , the Council 's inaction stands in stark contrast to the collective position of the international community , as reflected in the Council , the great potential damage of Israel 's decision , its impact on the Middle East peace process , and the great harm wrought by the failure of the Council to adopt this draft resolution .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The extended closings of the West Bank and Gaza with the resulting disastrous economic consequences , the progressive isolation of Palestinians from access to Jerusalem , the establishment and expansion of settlements , the denial of access to refugees and the endless incarceration of prisoners , among other issues , have indelibly marked our hearts and stirred our collective sense of determination to persist in this work .  
He called on the international community to condemn measures taken by the occupying Power in the occupied territories ; many of them were tantamount to collective punishment , had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the inhabitants , and were not only illegal but inhuman .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
Aware and convinced that the survival of humanity is a collective responsibility , we decided in Rio to establish a new kind of partnership built of common yet differentiated responsibility in order to promote national , regional and world cooperation for development that we wished to be sustainable .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
The practices and procedures outlined above have a negative impact on the economic , social and cultural rights of individuals and also on collective or communal rights ( right to development and right to a healthy environment ) .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
Furthermore , the report of the Secretary _ General stressed , in paragraph 23 , the persistent violation of the Israeli occupation authorities of the principles of international law , concerning administrative detention of Palestinians and the ill _ treatment and torture to which Palestinians are subjected , in accordance with an official decision made by the High Court and the Government of Israel , in addition to imposing collective punishments on Palestinians , among which is the demolition of houses in Jerusalem and in other regions of the occupied territory .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
The report dwells on the managerial role played by the existing instruments designed to provide collective guidance and advice to management and considers them to be cumbersome , to cause delays where promptness is required and to dilute responsibility .

His Government supported the rights-based approach insofar as it implied that both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights were inherent to the individual or the collective rather than conferred by an act of welfare or charity .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
Regarding the definition of injured State contained in article 40 , clarification is needed with respect to the phrase the right has been created or is established for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in paragraph 2 ( e ) ( iii ) , and the phrase for the protection of the collective interests of the State parties thereto in paragraph 2 ( f ) .  What is intended in article 42 , paragraph 2 , and article 43 , subparagraph ( d ) , is not defined clearly .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
The United Arab Emirates , which considered Israels actions to be unlawful , strongly condemned Israels arbitrary rule and immoral acts : collective punishment , the blockade of towns and villages , the profanation of Muslim sacred objects and places of worship , violence and the arbitrary detention and murder of innocent , peaceful inhabitants , including women and children . 
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
To counter the perceived threat and build a " clean social system " , 2 the regime launched a uniquely thorough revolution whereby all pre-existing economic , social and cultural institutions were abolished , all foreign influences were expunged and the entire population was transformed into a collective workforce , required to work at breakneck speed to build up the country 's economic strength .

Stresses that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance , as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy , and that it is not a substitute for but rather is complementary to North-South cooperation ;

They were also the subject of the working paper prepared for the fifth session by Mr .

The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 20 May 1996 confirmed the exceptional and temporary nature of the oil-for-food programme which was intended to provide for the most urgent humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people who were subjected to collective punishment through the most vile regime of comprehensive sanctions in history .  
The Government is anxious to see the potential for voluntary repatriation maximized and would like to see the existing camps closed prior to the winter period and the remaining refugees transferred to alternative accommodation in collective centres and / or host families .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
This is a professional body that is trained to focus on the protection and defence of the individual and collective rights of citizens and is sensitive to , and respectful of , ethnic , cultural and linguistic diversities . 
Of course , evolution of the international situation means that it is appropriate for existing rules of international law to be developed and adapted to prevailing conditions , but this should be done through collective discussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions , not as a fait accompli and not working from scratch : it should be based on valid rules of international law .  
It would be particularly dangerous , under the pretext of exorcising painful emotions or absolving the international community of its past inaction or its inability now and in the future to prevent or settle crises , to risk acting without the consent of a State , or even against its desire , with excesses as serious as regrettable endangering the collective security system so painstakingly built around the Security Council .  
So it is that the objective of collective security of States , associated with the new horizons opened up at the end of the cold war and serious progress towards general and complete disarmament which should involve first and foremost weapons of mass destruction will be expressed in the new terms of physical well-being and quality of life for citizens .  
In order to ensure that it can contribute to laying the foundations for enduring and coherent development , intensified international cooperation as well as countries = own national and collective efforts will be essential to address effectively the shortcomings of the external environment and the constraints of underdevelopment .

The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
In this context , we believe that the General Assembly , as the sole democratic , universal and transparent organ of the United Nations , is the proper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implications of the emerging debate on collective action to address humanitarian catastrophes .  
Rather , it rests with the selfish and unilateral policies of the controlling Powers , whose interests can not be served by using the United Nations mechanisms established for the correct application of the principles and rules of the Charter , which reflect the joint will and collective interests of the members of the international community . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
A strong and efficient United Nations will allow us to attain the main objective of this initiative : to determine agreed parameters for creating a stable and prosperous world without violence and without war , on the basis of the principles of inter-State relations contained in the Charter , and to find collective responses to the most complicated global challenges .  
While it is true that achieving social development , improving our economic performance and eradicating poverty are first and foremost national responsibilities , they can be successfully achieved only through the collective will and collective efforts of the international community as outlined by the principles and objectives of Copenhagen . 
The Security Council , charged with maintaining international peace and security , is the sole body that can authorize the use of force , and it is the international communitys mechanism for collective security , intended to protect the common interest rather than that of an individual or a specific group .  
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
Two months later , at Sirte in Libya , the fourth extraordinary session of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU considered the ways and means of strengthening the organization with a view to rendering it more effective and adaptable to social , political and economic changes and to making it the preferred instrument for collective action for Africa and for cooperation with the rest of the world .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .

All indigenous peoples have a collective and individual right to free , comprehensive and diversified education at all levels and in all forms of basic , middle and higher education in their own languages , including bilingual education .  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .

How are the negative environmental impacts of oil and mineral production to be minimized in LDCs , and how can the collective commitment of major international companies to good environmental management contribute to this objective ?  
However , the special nature and complexity of transnational organized crime demands that the collective legal thinking of States should be challenged to find ways to prevent such differences from impeding effective action .  
This policy should , include as a minimum , completion of the process of adapting the substantive and procedural legal framework to the requirements of the international norms governing collective bargaining and trade union freedom .  
The preferred collective approach , therefore , should be to concentrate efforts for a political solution based on a robust and credible international military presence .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right .  
Finally , let me express our hope that the current open debate , focused on the Secretary-Generals report on conflict prevention , will foster the effective implementation of the recommendations contained therein and contribute to the goal of mobilizing the collective potential of the United Nations , its Member States and other international stakeholders in eliminating the threat of the emergence of armed conflicts .  
It is appropriate to recall today that , against the backdrop of an Israeli occupation that has continued for several decades , the Government of Ariel Sharon initiated a systematic policy of aggression against the Palestinian people , destroying their property , imposing economic blockades on their towns and villages and collective punishment through the repeated use of excessive and sustained force with all the weapons in the Israeli arsenal , and using force on a daily basis against unarmed Palestinian civilians .  
In welcoming the Agreement , I stated that it reflected the collective will of the leaders and Governments of both countries to set aside a destructive dispute , and to turn their energies and abilities to advancing the shared needs of both their peoples .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right ,  
Emphasizing the urgent need for recognition of the collective and shared responsibility of the international community in addressing the root causes of the drug problem and threats related thereto in a comprehensive manner through an intersectoral approach and coordination at the national , regional and international level ,  
Affirm that the first logical and credible step to be taken at this juncture of our collective struggle is for the World Conference to declare solemnly that the international community as a whole fully recognizes the historical injustices of the slave trade and that colonialism and apartheid are among the most serious and massive institutionalized forms of human rights violations ;  
An international observatory should be established to monitor racially discriminatory attitudes and acts , individual or collective , private or public , including by non-State actors , charged with the following tasks :  
Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Food Summit and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights was also implementing , with support from UNICEF and from Save the Children , a prevention project entitled Protection of the basic rights of children and young people , designed to involve children and young people in collective activities at the local and national level by developing their capacities and skills as leaders and organizers .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
This was and is achieved either on a voluntary basis by persuading investors ( by offering them favourable rates ) or on a compulsory basis by obliging investors to entrust their certificates to banks or brokers for delivery into collective deposits held by a specialized institution acting exclusively as central depository .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
This initiative is expected to promote regional integration through enhancing the collective value of small and fragmented markets in the creation of trade and the expansion of exports ; develop shared infrastructure ; and tackle common environmental and social problems .  
Recognizing the need for deepening its collective analysis of the many interrelated dimensions of globalization and their implications for the work of the system , ACC continued its reflection during 2000 on the impact of globalization , focusing at its first regular session , on the interrelationships between trade and economic , social and environmental dimensions and on the issue of information technology ( see ACC / 2000 / 4 ) .  
The collective capacities of the system need to be harnessed to enrich and expand the knowledge base required nationally as well as internationally to broaden perspectives , act to address potential conflicts such as between trade rules and global , social and environmental goals , and maximize mutual reinforcement among policies and actions in different sectors in support of poverty eradication and development .  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
They therefore include commitments on amending the legal framework , strengthening and decentralizing the Ministry of Labour and Social Security , providing occupational training and education , improving social security and expanding its coverage , protecting the most vulnerable categories of workers and promoting collective bargaining and consensus methods of settling labour disputes .  
In addition , the Declaration prohibits individual or collective expulsion on discriminatory grounds ( art . 7 ) and provides for trade union rights , the right to safe and healthy working conditions and the right to medical care , social security , and education ( art .  8 ) .  
ILO Convention No . 97 further provides that migrant workers receive treatment no less favourable than that which is applied to nationals with respect to remuneration ; membership in trade unions and the enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining ; accommodation ; and social security including legal provision regarding employment injury , maternity , sickness , invalidity , old age , death , unemployment and family responsibilities , and any other contingency which , according to national laws or regulations , is covered by a social security scheme .  
ILO Convention No . 143 also provides that States parties pursue a national policy designed to promote and to guarantee equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment , occupation , social security , trade union and cultural rights , and of individual and collective freedoms for persons who as migrant workers or as members of their families are lawfully within its territory .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
It also points to two defining elements of the philosophy underlying the collective security system : first , preventing armed conflict is a more desirable and cost-effective strategy to ensure lasting peace and security than trying to stop it or alleviate its symptoms ; and second , armed international conflicts are best prevented by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered , as provided for in Article 2 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter .  
HIV / AIDS is now a classic , modern health issue , closely connected with individual and collective human behaviour , strongly influenced by broad social and economic forces and linked particularly closely to social discrimination .  
The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .  
However , it must always be borne in mind that the task is complicated by the fact that it is not merely a question of combating laws , regulations and policies , but also of combating cultural practices that are rooted in collective memory and in the deep ancestral beliefs of people , including women themselves , and that , sometimes these harmful practices , although often contrary to religions , are perpetuated in the name of religion , or imputed to religion .  
In that connection , the Cypriot Government stated that it was established that remuneration and other benefits for foreign workers would be those defined for Cypriot workers by the relevant collective agreements , that the transportation costs for foreign workers from their countries of origin were borne exclusively by the employer and that special health insurance covered the foreign worker at least to the same extent as that provided by the collective agreements for Cypriot workers .  
The Inter-American Democratic Charter represents an important initiative , promoted by Peru , and reflects regional consensus on an unprecedented instrument which systematizes principles , norms and mechanisms for collective action , including diplomatic sanctions in cases of alteration or interruption of democratic institutionality , with a view to promoting , preserving and defending democracy from a human rights perspective .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
Informal processes may take various forms , ranging from a completely informal process based upon non-binding principles which support a collective negotiating framework and do not involve the judicial system ( although relying on the existence of an efficient and effective formal system for leverage ) , to those which utilize a judicial administration mechanism to enforce a plan reached by informal negotiations and to bind creditors to that plan .  
I would imagine that we would also agree that it was proper that this Conference should be held in South Africa , a country that has witnessed the most egregious form of institutionalized racism , yet rose to become a living testimony that racism can be defeated with the collective efforts of the international community .  Gathered at this Conference , as Member States , we have at some time or another stood at the precipice .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
To promote the reinforcement of open public and private institutions and clearly defined standards that will help all individual and collective actors to forge their own development process and strengthen institutional links among economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population , as set forth in Agenda 21 , through national sustainable development councils .

While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .
