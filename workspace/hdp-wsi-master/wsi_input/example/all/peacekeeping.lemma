Observers here are convinced that the fundamental cause of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is because the UN delegation and international peacekeeping force in Kosovo have not earnestly implemented Resolution 1244 adopted by the UNSC but are carrying out a policy of " supporting Albanians and suppressing Serbs . " They have shown partiality for and connived with Albanian extremists ' " ethnic cleansing " against other nationalities .  
Under this circumstance , how do we prevent the United Nations from being swept to one side again ; how do we make the relations between big nations remain " unbroken amid fighting " ; and how do we conduct peacekeeping missions , under the auspices or with the approval of this major international organization , in a more cautious manner and on a more rationale scale , are " complicated arts " that need to be studied .  
Specifically speaking , the United Nations should stick to the principle that countries , big or small , should be equal , pay attention to the positive principle of world development , implement the principle of generally acknowledged truth of its peacekeeping action , follow the just principle of reforming the United Nations , carry out the consistent principle of opposing power politics of the superpower , observe the peace principle of settling international disputes , and maintaining the principle of neutrality for all UN personnel from the chief executive of the Secretariat to the ordinary working personnel .  
Practice has proved that the success or failure of UN peacekeeping operations depends on whether they are carried out in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , and in particular , whether they follow the principles of respecting national sovereignty , refraining from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs , gaining the consent of the parties involved , maintaining a neutral stand , and refraining from using armed force except in self-defense .  
Zhu Bangzao said that complying with the purpose and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and norms governing international relations , especially the principles of respecting state sovereignty , not interfering in internal affairs , obtaining approval of the party concerned , neutrality , and not using force except for self-defense , is the fundamental guarantee to the smooth process and success of peacekeeping activities .  These principles remain to be the basic principles that should be strictly complied with in UN peacekeeping activities in future .  
He was aware that the United Nations and certain of its organs had specific needs , such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities , and considered that special statutory provisions should be applied in those cases .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
Greater efforts should be made to create a more positive and balanced public image of the United Nations , encompassing not only political and peacekeeping activities but also its economic and social achievements .  
The lack of available required cash has also resulted in the occasional temporary borrowing of any temporary excess cash in special peacekeeping accounts to meet the daily operational requirements of those peacekeeping operations with deficits .  
I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
The Advisory Committee was informed , upon inquiry , that UNAMIR posts have not been classified , since the posts established for peacekeeping operations are considered to be of temporary duration and thus not subject to the existing classification procedures .  
Since international public support was a necessary prerequisite for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions , the number of which was increasing , an effective information and communication component was essential to their success .  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
Since complex emergencies could not be addressed through traditional peacekeeping efforts alone , they required a comprehensive approach and sustained efforts by the States concerned , as well as assistance through regional arrangements and organizations .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
He referred to the recent visit to China by the SecretaryGeneral who not only pointed out the critical role of international peacekeeping in promoting global security but also the vital importance of sustainable social and economic development .  
The debate on the issues raised within the Agenda for Peace evoked , and in fact continues to evoke , mixed reactions within and outside the United Nations , developing into a continuing debate as the issues raised deal with questions of international peace and security , with substantial focus on the United Nations peacekeeping activities .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
The existence of landmines and other undetonated explosive devices in various regions of the world is a tremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the security , health and survival of the local population where these deadly devices have been scattered .  These devices prevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and impede humanitarian operations and programmes , national reconstruction and economic development activities and peacekeeping operations .  
It has played a significant , discernible and indispensable role in human affairs , from the peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to economic development and social progress , from food and agriculture to employment and labour standards , from helping the children of our world to fostering human rights and justice .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The items permanently on the Council 's agenda are so numerous and so important that it would be expedient for it to advise the Assembly on everything that , one way or another , might affect international peace and security ; on cases in which sanctions or other coercive measures are applied ; on the establishment , fulfilment or change of mandate of peacekeeping operations ; or on all other actions where the Security Council itself would do well to secure a broad international consensus .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
The unbounded enthusiasm felt by so many staff members , the many posts of great responsibility within the Organization that he has occupied with such brilliance , the admirable management of sensitive issues such as Kuwait and Bosnia and Herzegovina , and the smooth conduct of delicate peacekeeping operations attest to the competence and effectiveness of the man and justify the great hopes his appointment has inspired .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
With regard to the future work of the Special Committee , the draft declaration on the basic principles and criteria for the work of United Nations peacekeeping missions and mechanisms for the prevention and settlement of crises and conflicts submitted by the Russian Federation should be carefully studied in order to draw up a complete , precise and innovative text in an area which was so important for the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
His delegation recognized that it would not be easy to reach agreement on a 20 per cent ceiling , but in recent years Portugal and Greece had both voluntarily agreed to increase their peacekeeping rates and numerous countries had joined the consensus two years previously on a regular scale that increased their rates . 
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
IMIS is progressively replacing the numerous independent systems , many of which , built many years ago and mostly for regular budget activities , are no longer able to provide the support needed by management at a time of rapidly changing needs and increasing demands made on the administrative sector to support extensive peacekeeping activities and those financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
DUSCHNER ( Canada ) , speaking on behalf of Australia , Canada and New Zealand , said that her delegation was pleased with the success of the new budget cycle implemented pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 233 , since it had streamlined the administrative and budgetary process for the financing of peacekeeping .  
In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
The main conclusions and recommendations in that regard were : to prepare and submit to the General Assembly for consideration a comprehensive strategic programme of cooperation with regional organizations in peacekeeping and other peace-related activities , for the development of which it was necessary to establish a project team composed of representatives of all departments concerned ; to conclude bilateral framework agreements between United Nations and regional organizations concerning practical aspects of peacekeeping and other peace-related activities ; and to create a mechanism for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Given the increasing interrelationship between political , economic , social , military and cultural factors in conflicts , the concept of peacekeeping had been modified and had acquired a multidimensional and integral character .  
AYEWAH ( Nigeria ) said that the rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping operations since the end of the cold war reflected the belief in such operations as an effective instrument for stabilizing , containing and helping to resolve conflicts which undermined confidence among States and endangered international peace and security .  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .  
Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
It supported proposals which allowed the Secretariat to have a greater capacity to conduct feasibility studies of options for the consideration of the Security Council ; translate mandates into achievable concepts of operations ; provide timely advice and support to the field and meaningful feedback to the Security Council ; and develop doctrines and operational concepts , standing operational procedures and related common terminology for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
The Special Committee also noted the significant work accomplished by personnel provided by some Member States on loan to the Organization , including in specialized areas essential to support of peacekeeping operations , and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the recruitment and use of loaned personnel was consistent with the requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations , including that due regard be paid to wide geographical representation .  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of the Czech Republic for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 6 below ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had the Czech Republic been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of Slovakia for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 4 below ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had Slovakia been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of the Czech Republic for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 6 below ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had the Czech Republic been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of Slovakia for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 4 below ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had Slovakia been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
We do not wish these meetings to be transformed into routine or symbolic occasions , but to become a forum for candid and transparent discussions on all issues related to specific troops participating in peacekeeping operations .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
Indeed , it is in recognition of the critical importance of the success of this peace process to achieve durable peace in the Middle East that Japan has been actively participating in the peace process by engaging in intensified dialogue with the parties directly concerned , by sending its own contingents to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region , and by offering its active contribution to the multilateral talks on the Middle East launched in Madrid in 1991 .  
The European Union has often stated that the crisis can not be resolved until all Member States have agreed to meet their obligations under the United Nations Charter in full by settling their arrears and by paying on time and without conditions the full amount of their mandatory contributions to the Organization 's regular budget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations . 
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .  
Through the daily briefings given by the Spokesman and the increasing number of one-on-one contacts with journalists , the Office provides authoritative and timely information on the daily activities of the Secretary-General , as well as on peacekeeping operations , peacemaking , humanitarian assistance and a wide range of economic and social issues .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
In coming up with the recommendations contained in paragraph 79 ( d ) , the Panel benefited greatly from the presence of a Canadian expert among its members and through him received valuable inputs from the Canadian Government based on its extensive past experiences and lessons learnt in connection with the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
Currently , UNSCP work areas are as follows : ( a ) support of peacekeeping , peacemaking and peace-building and management of complex emergencies and post-conflict recovery , representing a combination of joint training and shared reflection on key aspects of field operations in those areas and their cross-sectoral and inter-institutional dimensions ; ( b ) support of management development , organizational learning and change in the United Nations system ; and ( c ) support of economic and social development , development management and development studies .  
Thus , in the light of this mandatory requirement for future peacekeeping operations , the Member States that have already pledged to the standby arrangements system may wish to exchange in advance data required by annexes A , B and C to the Memorandum of Understanding on contingent-owned equipment ( A / 51 / 967 ) , within the framework of the standby arrangements system .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .  
Even though the total number of peacekeeping operations and their average size have been reduced in recent years , peacekeeping is still the key instrument available to the United Nations in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force would be coordinated in predetermined tactical or logistical modules in a state of operational readiness on their respective territories and could be sent into action at short notice .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
In paragraphs 5 to 8 of the resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit plans for sharing the costs of establishing and operating a global networking facility with United Nations specialized agencies and programmes ; to report on requirements for network services ; to propose formulas for cost sharing ; to provide comprehensive information concerning location of telecommunications facilities in Member States ; and to show clearly the costs of telecommunications attributable to peacekeeping operations .  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of the Czech Republic for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 6 below ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of Slovakia for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 4 below ;  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
More recently , with the rapid growth of mandated activities , the Secretary-General had been able to turn to Member States to provide gratis personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
There are , however , signs that the successful implementation of this operation is threatened , primarily because the separatist leadership opposes their return , as is the phased restoration of the natural regional demographics which would be an inevitable consequence of an expanded peacekeeping mandate .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
In order to achieve the efficient utilization of resources and the streamlined and transparent financial and budgetary procedures envisaged in resolution 49 / 233 , the Special Committee urges the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop a coherent strategy for logistic support of peacekeeping operations .  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
The paragraphs on which a separate vote had been taken contained political elements which were not appropriate in a financing resolution and violated long-standing budgetary principles for peacekeeping operations based on collective responsibility .  
His delegation supported the phasing out of gratis personnel and their replacement by international civil servants , and was opposed to any arbitrary financial ceiling that might adversely affect backstopping of peacekeeping operations .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
In order to train these units for future missions , the countries members of the Committee have agreed to organize joint military exercises in connection with mock peacekeeping operations , scheduled to be held in south-western Gabon in 1999 .  
The Secretariat further stated that the Working Group recommendation could only be accepted if fixed and reasonable limits on the amounts compensable , per peacekeeping operation and per contributing Member State , were established ;  
If indeed there is a genuine desire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly peacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts , then comprehensive , concerted and concrete action on economic development cooperation must be taken .  
Because the extensive use and destructive power of landmines have become critical items on the international agenda , the Secretary-General decided the issue should be addressed in the dual context of peacekeeping and humanitarian operations .  
It was projected that at the end of 1998 , combined cash would total $ 528-million , based on regular budget cash of negative $ 247-million and peacekeeping positive balances of $ 775-million .  
In recent conflicts in Africa , we have also seen abundant evidence of how perceptions of political or historical associations may complicate regional efforts to resolve a conflict , so that direct international involvement , including through deployment of a peacekeeping operation , may be indispensable if peace is to be preserved .  
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
The Secretariat has accordingly pursued a policy of waiving the immunity from legal process enjoyed by force commanders and other peacekeeping personnel to the extent necessary to permit them to answer questions that seek to establish the existence of any of the elements of any of the crimes set out in the statutes of the international tribunals , or that might establish the existence , in respect of any individual , of circumstances of an exculpatory or mitigatory nature .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
Feature formats will focus on peacekeeping , economic and social development , human rights , sustainable development , the advancement of women , the question of Palestine , environmental issues , international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , international drug trafficking , health , population and development , youth and issues of regional concern ( News and Media Division ) ; iv . 
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .  
However , in order to effectively and efficiently meet the heavy and varied demands of the United Nations for legal services provided under this subprogramme , which requires a range of expertise , all attorneys of the Division , whether funded from the regular budget of the United Nations , from peacekeeping assessments or from resources provided by the separately funded , subsidiary organs , are treated as an integral part of the Division .  
In addition to the need to underscore , for all concerned , the key role that the quality of public information and communications activities plays in the effectiveness and success of peacekeeping operations in the field , the Department has developed cooperative mechanisms , enabling it to provide the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other concerned departments with all the programmatic support necessary to undertake appropriate information programmes .  
The use of such personnel had been expanded from the traditional area of technical cooperation to other sectors such as military planning , logistical support for peacekeeping operations , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , internal oversight , economic and social research and administration and management .  
The Department is responsible for the management and direction of peacekeeping operations ; the provision of comprehensive administrative and logistic support to all field missions ; the development , maintenance and enhancement of a ready , flexible capacity to undertake peacekeeping and other field operations ; and for acting as the focal point in the coordination , monitoring and development of integrated mine-action programmes .  
Mr . Hughes ( New Zealand ) speaking on behalf of the delegations of Australia , Canada and New Zealand ( CANZ ) , said that commendable improvements had been made in the peacekeeping budgets for 19992000 : the use of budget techniques that placed more emphasis on actual field experience rather than standard or notional costings had led to significant reductions in the 19992000 estimates and should lead to a decrease in the large unencumbered balances characteristic of recent peacekeeping budgets .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
It was stressed , however , that prior to undertaking peacekeeping missions , every effort should be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
These include reorganization of divisions ; formal procedures for setting priorities and monitoring at regular monthly meetings with clients ; establishing a continuing legal education programme for its staff to keep abreast of developments in , for example , the financing , insurance , copyright and trademark and arbitration fields ; playing a larger role in the selection and training of legal officers for peacekeeping missions and establishment of a time-keeping system .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Among the issues that require detailed discussion are the division of labour between the United Nations and ECOWAS , the need to provide a credible level of security throughout the country ( including the rebel-controlled areas ) , the appropriate size and composition of the required neutral peacekeeping force , the deployment of units to the various regions of the country and arrangements for logistical support .  
The Secretariat should note in particular the clear and unambiguous language of paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution , which emphasized that all future and existing peacekeeping missions should be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and that no peacekeeping mission should be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions .  
His delegation therefore strongly supported the views which had been expressed by the representative of Uganda on the need for equal treatment of peacekeeping missions , particularly those in Africa , and therefore welcomed the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution , which called for equal treatment and adequate resources for all future and existing peacekeeping missions .  
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
The Special Rapporteurs point of view has already been stated : the international community can not , without undermining the principles on which its very existence is based , allow the globalized market to function as well for the free and unrestricted sale of military assistance and active peacekeeping and peace-building operations that are the province of international organizations .  
The military aspects provide for an immediate ceasefire , the release of hostages within three days ( although this concept is unclear , since those whom RCD regard as hostages are considered by the Kinshasa Government to be protected persons ; the word hostages is not defined in annex A ) , a joint military commission , and an international peacekeeping force administered by the United Nations . 
These include , to name only a few , proposals for the deployment of preventive peacekeeping operations ; the need to establish working groups of the Security Council to address specific volatile situations ; the establishment of a permanent technical review mechanism of the United Nations ; and the imposition of verifiable arms embargoes to limit the ability of warring parties to wage war against one another and against civilians .  
Fourthly , in terms of comprehensive peacekeeping mandates , it was encouraging to hear members emphasize the changing perception of peacekeeping operations and the recognition that modern peacekeeping entails more comprehensive operations with extremely complex , multifaceted programmes and , indeed , more robust enforcement mandates , as has been discussed in this Council in recent days .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
That support has been consistently reflected in Indonesias support of Africas objectives ; through our active participation in many international and regional forums , including our participation in various peacekeeping operations and South-South cooperation ; and also through the strong bilateral relations that Indonesia maintains throughout the continent .  
Everyone is aware that this trade has contributed to intensifying and prolonging armed conflicts in Africa , and to further complicating peacekeeping efforts by impeding economic and social development in certain regions of the continent .  
Scenario 1 projected an end-of-year payment of $ 197-million by the United States , while scenario 2 assumed that the United States would pay sufficient regular budget and peacekeeping assessments , in addition to funds which it had previously appropriated but not yet paid , to reduce its total obligations to the equivalent of the most recent two-year assessments , or approximately $ 350-million .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
It should be noted that the current proposal to include mine action in the assessed budget of the peacekeeping mission is specific to the situation in Kosovo , and the adoption of this principle will not affect or change the way in which existing mine action programmes supported by the United Nations are funded , generally through voluntary contributions to established trust funds .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
In this connection , the Advisory Committee was informed that serious constraints have also been encountered in obtaining the dedicated services of requisite personnel from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations owing to the current rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping activities , as well as in retaining highly skilled technical IMIS staff and finding qualified personnel in the field of information technology under the current United Nations salary scales .  
Based on the many discussions I have had with the parties and others concerned , it is my understanding that the existing areas of United Nations activity in the Middle East , from assistance to refugees and regional development activities to peacekeeping missions , as well as some additional areas of activity , are likely to be raised by the parties themselves in the forthcoming rounds of negotiations .  
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
We believe and this is the assessment of all the experts concerned that it is wise and prudent that the peacekeeping force taking over from the multinational force should be a strong , credible force , and that it should be endowed with a credible deterrent capacity .  
We attach particular importance to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , by which the General Assembly emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates .  
The Department is responsible for the management and direction of peacekeeping operations ; the provision of comprehensive administrative and logistic support to all field missions ; the development , maintenance and enhancement of a ready , flexible capacity to undertake peacekeeping and other field operations ; and for acting as the focal point in the coordination , monitoring and development of integrated mine-action programmes .  
Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
The Fourth Committee reiterated that peacekeeping operations are an essential instrument in the strengthening of international peace and security and that , because of the multidisciplinary nature of current operations , their mandates should be subject to responsible guidelines and revitalized approaches , on the basis of the purposes and principles proclaimed by the United Nations .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
They included observing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , especially the principles of State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States ; following the three basic principles guiding peacekeeping operations , namely the consent of the parties concerned , strict neutrality and non-use of force except in self-defence ; and settling disputes through peaceful means , such as good offices , mediation and negotiation .  
Taking note of the decision contained in the recently adopted General Assembly resolution 53-12 on the rapidly deployable mission headquarters , China considered that in the current difficult financial situation faced by the United Nations and the relative scaling down of peacekeeping operations , the efforts to strengthen the rapid deployment capability should be focused on tapping the full potential of current mechanisms .  
It also supported the recommendation that a broad geographical base that took into account the sizes of the contingents from the various contributing countries should be used in selecting civilian police commissioners and appointing other senior police personnel for peacekeeping operations .  
While in future United Nations peacekeeping operations great importance would be attached to national reconciliation as a basis for lasting peace , a situation in which reconciliation and national healing were impossible in the existing circumstances should also be foreseen .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
Enhance the rapid deployment capacity of the Logistics Base by providing the best service possible to newly established peacekeeping missions and also to strengthen the logistics support of existing peacekeeping missions by taking action in a timely fashion on material release orders as follows : immediate operational requirements in 24 hours , urgent requests in 7 days and routine requests in 15 to 21 days ;  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
While it recognized the distinct nature of peacekeeping operations and humanitarian activities , it also saw a need to grapple with the unfortunate reality , which increasingly required the Department to take a proactive role in protecting humanitarian assistance in complex conflict situations .  
Statements I , II and III contain financial results for all United Nations peacekeeping funds , which are broken down into three groups of related funds and consolidated into a grand total reflecting all individual peacekeeping accounts of the Organization . 
There remained a huge disparity between military expenditure at the national level and the resources set aside at the international level for preventative diplomacy , peacemaking and peacekeeping .  
The substantive part of the declaration should help to strengthen the legal basis for peacekeeping operations , both in the preparatory phase and in their implementation , with regard to all their economic , financial , political and human aspects .  
The Special Committee stresses the importance of having senior military commanders , police commissioners and key staff personnel selected , prepared and trained prior to their deployment to a peacekeeping operation .  
First , peacekeeping operations must be endowed with a clear , realistic mandate commensurate with the established goals and backed by the necessary political , military and moral decisions .  
Consequently , peacekeeping operations were becoming larger and more costly , and total peacekeeping expenditure for the current fiscal year was expected to be more than double that for the preceding fiscal year .  
Preparing comprehensive military operational plans for new peacekeeping operations , participating in fact finding missions to current and potential mission areas and , as required , revising and modifying plans for current operations ;  
The current ad hoc peacekeeping scale should be replaced by a stable , transparent , equitable and effective mechanism based on objective economic criteria .  
The Committee recognized the increasing need for the participation of female personnel , on a broad geographical basis , in all aspects of peacekeeping operations and encouraged the development and implementation of innovative strategies to further that aim .  
Mr . Halbwachs ( Controller ) said , in reply to a question posed by the Cuban delegation at the preceding meeting , that the level of financial and human resources proposed for the support account was adequate to support current peacekeeping operations .  
His delegation earnestly hoped that the question would be addressed during the current debate in a spirit of mutual accommodation and understanding , with the sole objective of ensuring a secure financial foundation for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
In view of the vital role which peacekeeping operations played in a world plagued by regional and intraState conflicts , it was important to provide the financial , human and logistical resources needed for the effective fulfilment of their mandates .  
Unfortunately , the peacekeeping resources of the Organization are not limitless , and they must be apportioned in the best possible way , in a manner commensurate with the real danger posed by a given conflict to regional and global stability .  
The Council can act with a view to monitoring and ensuring compliance with current Council resolutions ; improving communication and coordination with other United Nations organs and authoritative bodies involved in the protection of civilians , particularly children ; ensuring that the post-conflict environment nurtures the rights and needs of children , including rehabilitation , which is integral to future stability and development ; and ensuring that the it takes an integrated and interdisciplinary approach and gives due consideration to the rights of children when considering peacekeeping operations .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
That is a severe disappointment , but it was a prudent decision based on the current and growing level of peacekeeping activity and the need for sufficient cash to cover the requirements for these ongoing missions .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
The unbudgeted expenditure of $ 65,200 was required to meet peacekeeping related increases in workload for both the Peacekeeping Financing Division and the Accounts Division in connection with the establishment and start up of the three new missions and the expansion of an existing mission , as well as outstanding tasks remaining for completed and closed operations .  
Objective : To ensure timely and effective administrative and logistical support to peacekeeping operations , as well as other activities in the field authorized by the United Nations , and an effective , proactive and coordinated response to threats from landmines and unexploded ordnance .  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
Decides to apply the unencumbered balance of 1,300,900 dollars from the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 , inclusive of 1,273,000 dollars in miscellaneous and interest income , and to prorate the balance of 75,846,200 dollars gross ( 66,562,500 dollars net ) among the individual active peacekeeping operation budgets , to meet the resources required for the support account for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 . 
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
East Timor is a good example of the need for the international community to build on a successful peacekeeping intervention by laying the political , economic , judicial and constitutional foundations for lasting peace and security .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
The comprehensive review has identified the need for enhancements within the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General to ensure that it has adequate capacity to meet the demands and requirements of both the Office and the field missions , capability for identifying the policies , tools and capacities needed for future peacekeeping operations , and capable of ensuring effective integration of activities within the Office of Mission Support and the Department .

It will coordinate geographical analysis requirements within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations , collect , evaluate and disseminate geographic information for peacekeeping operations , prepare the GIS-related portion of policies , guidelines and standard operating procedures and establish an engineers online Intranet site within the existing Global WAN of the Department , including maintaining the engineering database for FACS . 5.100 The following three additional posts are requested for the Engineering Service : 
The incumbent will be responsible for overall planning , review of field mission budget requirements , resource planning , engineering designs for horizontal and vertical construction , inclusive of modular / prefabricated facilities , and general oversight on and coordinated execution of the mandated engineering programme and related support activities in the peacekeeping operations , ensuring that effective support is rendered in a timely and economical manner .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
In addition , the peacekeeping vehicle fleet is more varied and more technically sophisticated than ever before , and represents a significant investment by the Member States , which necessitates the promulgation of operating practices and professional development programmes for its motor transport specialists and its vehicle operators and their supervisors to ensure that maximum utility is obtained from these assets with the lowest practicable operating costs . 
Once the revised budgets for missions in transition ( UNMEE , UNAMSIL , MONUC and UNIFIL ) and for the support account for peacekeeping operations , with the proposed resource requirements resulting from the comprehensive review and capacity study , have been considered by the General Assembly , budget levels are projected to increase over the initial current level of $ 1.7-billion to some slightly in excess of $ 3.0-billion for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
The resources for ALU , which are insufficient to handle the existing workload , are totally inadequate to address the recommendations in the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to : ( a ) improve administrative support to the missions by reducing the otherwise unavoidable delays in handling their disciplinary matters ; and ( b ) allow for more support and training of administrative personnel in peacekeeping through lessons learned and guidelines .  
It is proposed to strengthen the Training Unit by two Professional ( 1 P-3 and 1-P-2 ) and one Security Service post to provide more comprehensive central training for security officers seconded or appointed to new and / or expanded peacekeeping operations on firearms qualification and certification , incident command system , dignitary protection , advanced security skills , United Nations use-of-force policy , emergency operations , investigations , fire and safety regulations , defensive tactics and advance first-aid provision . 
Responsibilities would include providing Intranet access to all peacekeeping missions ; designing and enhancing the Intranet to facilitate the sharing of sensitive information among restricted groups ; coordinating with field offices , installing hardware and software as required and provide ongoing technical support to servers , firewalls and related components of the infrastructure dedicated to the Intranet ;  
The Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit will be considerably strengthened and is intended to be at the heart of a new system by which the Organization learns from its peacekeeping experience , developing policies , procedures and related operational tools that are incorporated into the planning and conduct of both ongoing and future missions .  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
In order to enable OHCHR to provide adequate , systematic and prompt substantive support and to facilitate links with the broader United Nations human rights programme , there is a need to strengthen its capacity for daily advice and substantive backstopping to the increasing number of peacekeeping operations with human rights components .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
The present report therefore focuses on actual cash inflows as at 30 September 2001 , as well as cash payments expected during the last quarter of this year based on information received from Member States and on prior payment patterns , both in the aggregate and by category that is , the regular budget , peacekeeping and the international tribunals .  
Four distinct functional elements are delineated ( peacekeeping best practices and policy , public information , gender and peacekeeping and the Resource Centre ) , for which 19 new posts are requested ( 13 Professional and 6 General Service ( Other level ) ) , in addition to the current staffing of 8 .  
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective public information programmes in peacekeeping operations and the need to carefully identify and implement those programmes on the basis of objectives tailored to the specific needs of the missions concerned , including adequate resources for those programmes ( see A / 55 / 839 , para .  44 ) .  
The plan provides for an integrated peacekeeping mission headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General , which would be composed of a military component , a civilian police component , and a small civilian component , including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration .  The latter component will be essential to the functioning of the government in the immediate post-independence period .  
The Secretariat , which shared responsibility for the effective functioning of the Organization , should strive for efficiency by improving its billing system : the ability of States to meet the 30-day payment window for peacekeeping assessments would be greatly enhanced if the Secretariat provided an indicative schedule of assessment dates . 
The Sudan renewed its commitment to its position of principle advocating respect for the norms of international humanitarian law , bilateral agreements and national legislation on the part of all parties involved in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations , and it called for full account to be taken of the guiding principles for humanitarian assistance annexed to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
The Committee sought clarification with regard to the procedures to be followed in respect of budgeting for additional support account requirements related to UNIFIL and was informed that it was the intention of the Secretary-General , on the basis of whatever decision the General Assembly might take regarding the additional resources under the support account for peacekeeping operations , to prorate the financing of the additional support account resources approved among the upcoming revised financial resolutions for the missions , whose updated budgets will be considered during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly . 
As the worlds largest democracy , with enormous potential and rapidly growing economic power , and being a major contributor to peacekeeping operations , India has a natural claim to a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council .  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Develop and implement as well as strengthen already existing training programmes for law enforcement officers , prison officers , medical officers and judicial personnel , as well as United Nations personnel , including peacekeeping staff , to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of threatened and abused women and children infected with HIV / AIDS , including intravenous drug users , female inmates and orphans ;  
The data for this survey shall identify the common and essential additional costs from existing troop levels related to personnel that are incurred by troop-contributing countries due to their participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations , including the establishment of a standard vaccination package and identification of mission-specific vaccines and mission-specific medical and biochemical examinations , using the data available from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Childrens Fund , that could be liable for reimbursement ;  
Observers here are convinced that the fundamental cause of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is because the UN delegation and international peacekeeping force in Kosovo have not earnestly implemented Resolution 1244 adopted by the UNSC but are carrying out a policy of " supporting Albanians and suppressing Serbs . " They have shown partiality for and connived with Albanian extremists ' " ethnic cleansing " against other nationalities .  
Under this circumstance , how do we prevent the United Nations from being swept to one side again ; how do we make the relations between big nations remain " unbroken amid fighting " ; and how do we conduct peacekeeping missions , under the auspices or with the approval of this major international organization , in a more cautious manner and on a more rationale scale , are " complicated arts " that need to be studied .  
Specifically speaking , the United Nations should stick to the principle that countries , big or small , should be equal , pay attention to the positive principle of world development , implement the principle of generally acknowledged truth of its peacekeeping action , follow the just principle of reforming the United Nations , carry out the consistent principle of opposing power politics of the superpower , observe the peace principle of settling international disputes , and maintaining the principle of neutrality for all UN personnel from the chief executive of the Secretariat to the ordinary working personnel .  
Practice has proved that the success or failure of UN peacekeeping operations depends on whether they are carried out in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , and in particular , whether they follow the principles of respecting national sovereignty , refraining from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs , gaining the consent of the parties involved , maintaining a neutral stand , and refraining from using armed force except in self-defense .  
Zhu Bangzao said that complying with the purpose and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and norms governing international relations , especially the principles of respecting state sovereignty , not interfering in internal affairs , obtaining approval of the party concerned , neutrality , and not using force except for self-defense , is the fundamental guarantee to the smooth process and success of peacekeeping activities .  These principles remain to be the basic principles that should be strictly complied with in UN peacekeeping activities in future .  
He was aware that the United Nations and certain of its organs had specific needs , such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities , and considered that special statutory provisions should be applied in those cases .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
Greater efforts should be made to create a more positive and balanced public image of the United Nations , encompassing not only political and peacekeeping activities but also its economic and social achievements .  
The lack of available required cash has also resulted in the occasional temporary borrowing of any temporary excess cash in special peacekeeping accounts to meet the daily operational requirements of those peacekeeping operations with deficits .  
I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
The Advisory Committee was informed , upon inquiry , that UNAMIR posts have not been classified , since the posts established for peacekeeping operations are considered to be of temporary duration and thus not subject to the existing classification procedures .  
Since international public support was a necessary prerequisite for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions , the number of which was increasing , an effective information and communication component was essential to their success .  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
Since complex emergencies could not be addressed through traditional peacekeeping efforts alone , they required a comprehensive approach and sustained efforts by the States concerned , as well as assistance through regional arrangements and organizations .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
He referred to the recent visit to China by the SecretaryGeneral who not only pointed out the critical role of international peacekeeping in promoting global security but also the vital importance of sustainable social and economic development .  
The debate on the issues raised within the Agenda for Peace evoked , and in fact continues to evoke , mixed reactions within and outside the United Nations , developing into a continuing debate as the issues raised deal with questions of international peace and security , with substantial focus on the United Nations peacekeeping activities .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
The existence of landmines and other undetonated explosive devices in various regions of the world is a tremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the security , health and survival of the local population where these deadly devices have been scattered .  These devices prevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and impede humanitarian operations and programmes , national reconstruction and economic development activities and peacekeeping operations .  
It has played a significant , discernible and indispensable role in human affairs , from the peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to economic development and social progress , from food and agriculture to employment and labour standards , from helping the children of our world to fostering human rights and justice .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The items permanently on the Council 's agenda are so numerous and so important that it would be expedient for it to advise the Assembly on everything that , one way or another , might affect international peace and security ; on cases in which sanctions or other coercive measures are applied ; on the establishment , fulfilment or change of mandate of peacekeeping operations ; or on all other actions where the Security Council itself would do well to secure a broad international consensus .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
The unbounded enthusiasm felt by so many staff members , the many posts of great responsibility within the Organization that he has occupied with such brilliance , the admirable management of sensitive issues such as Kuwait and Bosnia and Herzegovina , and the smooth conduct of delicate peacekeeping operations attest to the competence and effectiveness of the man and justify the great hopes his appointment has inspired .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
With regard to the future work of the Special Committee , the draft declaration on the basic principles and criteria for the work of United Nations peacekeeping missions and mechanisms for the prevention and settlement of crises and conflicts submitted by the Russian Federation should be carefully studied in order to draw up a complete , precise and innovative text in an area which was so important for the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
His delegation recognized that it would not be easy to reach agreement on a 20 per cent ceiling , but in recent years Portugal and Greece had both voluntarily agreed to increase their peacekeeping rates and numerous countries had joined the consensus two years previously on a regular scale that increased their rates . 
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
IMIS is progressively replacing the numerous independent systems , many of which , built many years ago and mostly for regular budget activities , are no longer able to provide the support needed by management at a time of rapidly changing needs and increasing demands made on the administrative sector to support extensive peacekeeping activities and those financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
DUSCHNER ( Canada ) , speaking on behalf of Australia , Canada and New Zealand , said that her delegation was pleased with the success of the new budget cycle implemented pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 233 , since it had streamlined the administrative and budgetary process for the financing of peacekeeping .  
In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
The main conclusions and recommendations in that regard were : to prepare and submit to the General Assembly for consideration a comprehensive strategic programme of cooperation with regional organizations in peacekeeping and other peace-related activities , for the development of which it was necessary to establish a project team composed of representatives of all departments concerned ; to conclude bilateral framework agreements between United Nations and regional organizations concerning practical aspects of peacekeeping and other peace-related activities ; and to create a mechanism for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Given the increasing interrelationship between political , economic , social , military and cultural factors in conflicts , the concept of peacekeeping had been modified and had acquired a multidimensional and integral character .  
AYEWAH ( Nigeria ) said that the rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping operations since the end of the cold war reflected the belief in such operations as an effective instrument for stabilizing , containing and helping to resolve conflicts which undermined confidence among States and endangered international peace and security .  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .  
Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
It supported proposals which allowed the Secretariat to have a greater capacity to conduct feasibility studies of options for the consideration of the Security Council ; translate mandates into achievable concepts of operations ; provide timely advice and support to the field and meaningful feedback to the Security Council ; and develop doctrines and operational concepts , standing operational procedures and related common terminology for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
The Special Committee also noted the significant work accomplished by personnel provided by some Member States on loan to the Organization , including in specialized areas essential to support of peacekeeping operations , and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the recruitment and use of loaned personnel was consistent with the requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations , including that due regard be paid to wide geographical representation .  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of the Czech Republic for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 6 below ;

Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of Slovakia for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 4 below ;

The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of the Czech Republic for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 6 below ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had the Czech Republic been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of Slovakia for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 4 below ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had Slovakia been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
We do not wish these meetings to be transformed into routine or symbolic occasions , but to become a forum for candid and transparent discussions on all issues related to specific troops participating in peacekeeping operations .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
Indeed , it is in recognition of the critical importance of the success of this peace process to achieve durable peace in the Middle East that Japan has been actively participating in the peace process by engaging in intensified dialogue with the parties directly concerned , by sending its own contingents to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region , and by offering its active contribution to the multilateral talks on the Middle East launched in Madrid in 1991 .  
The European Union has often stated that the crisis can not be resolved until all Member States have agreed to meet their obligations under the United Nations Charter in full by settling their arrears and by paying on time and without conditions the full amount of their mandatory contributions to the Organization 's regular budget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations . 
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .  
Through the daily briefings given by the Spokesman and the increasing number of one-on-one contacts with journalists , the Office provides authoritative and timely information on the daily activities of the Secretary-General , as well as on peacekeeping operations , peacemaking , humanitarian assistance and a wide range of economic and social issues .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
In coming up with the recommendations contained in paragraph 79 ( d ) , the Panel benefited greatly from the presence of a Canadian expert among its members and through him received valuable inputs from the Canadian Government based on its extensive past experiences and lessons learnt in connection with the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
Currently , UNSCP work areas are as follows : ( a ) support of peacekeeping , peacemaking and peace-building and management of complex emergencies and post-conflict recovery , representing a combination of joint training and shared reflection on key aspects of field operations in those areas and their cross-sectoral and inter-institutional dimensions ; ( b ) support of management development , organizational learning and change in the United Nations system ; and ( c ) support of economic and social development , development management and development studies .  
Thus , in the light of this mandatory requirement for future peacekeeping operations , the Member States that have already pledged to the standby arrangements system may wish to exchange in advance data required by annexes A , B and C to the Memorandum of Understanding on contingent-owned equipment ( A / 51 / 967 ) , within the framework of the standby arrangements system .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .  
Even though the total number of peacekeeping operations and their average size have been reduced in recent years , peacekeeping is still the key instrument available to the United Nations in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force would be coordinated in predetermined tactical or logistical modules in a state of operational readiness on their respective territories and could be sent into action at short notice .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
In paragraphs 5 to 8 of the resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit plans for sharing the costs of establishing and operating a global networking facility with United Nations specialized agencies and programmes ; to report on requirements for network services ; to propose formulas for cost sharing ; to provide comprehensive information concerning location of telecommunications facilities in Member States ; and to show clearly the costs of telecommunications attributable to peacekeeping operations .  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of the Czech Republic for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 6 below ;  
Decides that , notwithstanding the provisions of resolution 48 / 223 A , the 1993 assessments of Slovakia for peacekeeping operations shall be credited to Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , and that the relative shares for 1993 shall be calculated on the same basis as set out in paragraph 4 below ;  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
More recently , with the rapid growth of mandated activities , the Secretary-General had been able to turn to Member States to provide gratis personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
There are , however , signs that the successful implementation of this operation is threatened , primarily because the separatist leadership opposes their return , as is the phased restoration of the natural regional demographics which would be an inevitable consequence of an expanded peacekeeping mandate .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
In order to achieve the efficient utilization of resources and the streamlined and transparent financial and budgetary procedures envisaged in resolution 49 / 233 , the Special Committee urges the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop a coherent strategy for logistic support of peacekeeping operations .  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
The paragraphs on which a separate vote had been taken contained political elements which were not appropriate in a financing resolution and violated long-standing budgetary principles for peacekeeping operations based on collective responsibility .  
His delegation supported the phasing out of gratis personnel and their replacement by international civil servants , and was opposed to any arbitrary financial ceiling that might adversely affect backstopping of peacekeeping operations .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
In order to train these units for future missions , the countries members of the Committee have agreed to organize joint military exercises in connection with mock peacekeeping operations , scheduled to be held in south-western Gabon in 1999 .  
The Secretariat further stated that the Working Group recommendation could only be accepted if fixed and reasonable limits on the amounts compensable , per peacekeeping operation and per contributing Member State , were established ;  
If indeed there is a genuine desire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly peacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts , then comprehensive , concerted and concrete action on economic development cooperation must be taken .  
Because the extensive use and destructive power of landmines have become critical items on the international agenda , the Secretary-General decided the issue should be addressed in the dual context of peacekeeping and humanitarian operations .  
It was projected that at the end of 1998 , combined cash would total $ 528-million , based on regular budget cash of negative $ 247-million and peacekeeping positive balances of $ 775-million .  
In recent conflicts in Africa , we have also seen abundant evidence of how perceptions of political or historical associations may complicate regional efforts to resolve a conflict , so that direct international involvement , including through deployment of a peacekeeping operation , may be indispensable if peace is to be preserved .  
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
The Secretariat has accordingly pursued a policy of waiving the immunity from legal process enjoyed by force commanders and other peacekeeping personnel to the extent necessary to permit them to answer questions that seek to establish the existence of any of the elements of any of the crimes set out in the statutes of the international tribunals , or that might establish the existence , in respect of any individual , of circumstances of an exculpatory or mitigatory nature .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
Feature formats will focus on peacekeeping , economic and social development , human rights , sustainable development , the advancement of women , the question of Palestine , environmental issues , international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , international drug trafficking , health , population and development , youth and issues of regional concern ( News and Media Division ) ; iv . 
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .  
However , in order to effectively and efficiently meet the heavy and varied demands of the United Nations for legal services provided under this subprogramme , which requires a range of expertise , all attorneys of the Division , whether funded from the regular budget of the United Nations , from peacekeeping assessments or from resources provided by the separately funded , subsidiary organs , are treated as an integral part of the Division .  
In addition to the need to underscore , for all concerned , the key role that the quality of public information and communications activities plays in the effectiveness and success of peacekeeping operations in the field , the Department has developed cooperative mechanisms , enabling it to provide the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other concerned departments with all the programmatic support necessary to undertake appropriate information programmes .  
The use of such personnel had been expanded from the traditional area of technical cooperation to other sectors such as military planning , logistical support for peacekeeping operations , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , internal oversight , economic and social research and administration and management .  
The Department is responsible for the management and direction of peacekeeping operations ; the provision of comprehensive administrative and logistic support to all field missions ; the development , maintenance and enhancement of a ready , flexible capacity to undertake peacekeeping and other field operations ; and for acting as the focal point in the coordination , monitoring and development of integrated mine-action programmes .  
Mr . Hughes ( New Zealand ) speaking on behalf of the delegations of Australia , Canada and New Zealand ( CANZ ) , said that commendable improvements had been made in the peacekeeping budgets for 19992000 : the use of budget techniques that placed more emphasis on actual field experience rather than standard or notional costings had led to significant reductions in the 19992000 estimates and should lead to a decrease in the large unencumbered balances characteristic of recent peacekeeping budgets .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
It was stressed , however , that prior to undertaking peacekeeping missions , every effort should be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
These include reorganization of divisions ; formal procedures for setting priorities and monitoring at regular monthly meetings with clients ; establishing a continuing legal education programme for its staff to keep abreast of developments in , for example , the financing , insurance , copyright and trademark and arbitration fields ; playing a larger role in the selection and training of legal officers for peacekeeping missions and establishment of a time-keeping system .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Among the issues that require detailed discussion are the division of labour between the United Nations and ECOWAS , the need to provide a credible level of security throughout the country ( including the rebel-controlled areas ) , the appropriate size and composition of the required neutral peacekeeping force , the deployment of units to the various regions of the country and arrangements for logistical support .  
The Secretariat should note in particular the clear and unambiguous language of paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution , which emphasized that all future and existing peacekeeping missions should be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and that no peacekeeping mission should be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions .  
His delegation therefore strongly supported the views which had been expressed by the representative of Uganda on the need for equal treatment of peacekeeping missions , particularly those in Africa , and therefore welcomed the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution , which called for equal treatment and adequate resources for all future and existing peacekeeping missions .  
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
The Special Rapporteurs point of view has already been stated : the international community can not , without undermining the principles on which its very existence is based , allow the globalized market to function as well for the free and unrestricted sale of military assistance and active peacekeeping and peace-building operations that are the province of international organizations .  
The military aspects provide for an immediate ceasefire , the release of hostages within three days ( although this concept is unclear , since those whom RCD regard as hostages are considered by the Kinshasa Government to be protected persons ; the word hostages is not defined in annex A ) , a joint military commission , and an international peacekeeping force administered by the United Nations . 
These include , to name only a few , proposals for the deployment of preventive peacekeeping operations ; the need to establish working groups of the Security Council to address specific volatile situations ; the establishment of a permanent technical review mechanism of the United Nations ; and the imposition of verifiable arms embargoes to limit the ability of warring parties to wage war against one another and against civilians .  
Fourthly , in terms of comprehensive peacekeeping mandates , it was encouraging to hear members emphasize the changing perception of peacekeeping operations and the recognition that modern peacekeeping entails more comprehensive operations with extremely complex , multifaceted programmes and , indeed , more robust enforcement mandates , as has been discussed in this Council in recent days .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
That support has been consistently reflected in Indonesias support of Africas objectives ; through our active participation in many international and regional forums , including our participation in various peacekeeping operations and South-South cooperation ; and also through the strong bilateral relations that Indonesia maintains throughout the continent .  
Everyone is aware that this trade has contributed to intensifying and prolonging armed conflicts in Africa , and to further complicating peacekeeping efforts by impeding economic and social development in certain regions of the continent .  
Scenario 1 projected an end-of-year payment of $ 197-million by the United States , while scenario 2 assumed that the United States would pay sufficient regular budget and peacekeeping assessments , in addition to funds which it had previously appropriated but not yet paid , to reduce its total obligations to the equivalent of the most recent two-year assessments , or approximately $ 350-million .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
It should be noted that the current proposal to include mine action in the assessed budget of the peacekeeping mission is specific to the situation in Kosovo , and the adoption of this principle will not affect or change the way in which existing mine action programmes supported by the United Nations are funded , generally through voluntary contributions to established trust funds .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
In this connection , the Advisory Committee was informed that serious constraints have also been encountered in obtaining the dedicated services of requisite personnel from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations owing to the current rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping activities , as well as in retaining highly skilled technical IMIS staff and finding qualified personnel in the field of information technology under the current United Nations salary scales .  
Based on the many discussions I have had with the parties and others concerned , it is my understanding that the existing areas of United Nations activity in the Middle East , from assistance to refugees and regional development activities to peacekeeping missions , as well as some additional areas of activity , are likely to be raised by the parties themselves in the forthcoming rounds of negotiations .  
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
We believe and this is the assessment of all the experts concerned that it is wise and prudent that the peacekeeping force taking over from the multinational force should be a strong , credible force , and that it should be endowed with a credible deterrent capacity .  
We attach particular importance to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , by which the General Assembly emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates .  
The Department is responsible for the management and direction of peacekeeping operations ; the provision of comprehensive administrative and logistic support to all field missions ; the development , maintenance and enhancement of a ready , flexible capacity to undertake peacekeeping and other field operations ; and for acting as the focal point in the coordination , monitoring and development of integrated mine-action programmes .  
Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
The Fourth Committee reiterated that peacekeeping operations are an essential instrument in the strengthening of international peace and security and that , because of the multidisciplinary nature of current operations , their mandates should be subject to responsible guidelines and revitalized approaches , on the basis of the purposes and principles proclaimed by the United Nations .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
They included observing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , especially the principles of State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States ; following the three basic principles guiding peacekeeping operations , namely the consent of the parties concerned , strict neutrality and non-use of force except in self-defence ; and settling disputes through peaceful means , such as good offices , mediation and negotiation .  
Taking note of the decision contained in the recently adopted General Assembly resolution 53-12 on the rapidly deployable mission headquarters , China considered that in the current difficult financial situation faced by the United Nations and the relative scaling down of peacekeeping operations , the efforts to strengthen the rapid deployment capability should be focused on tapping the full potential of current mechanisms .  
It also supported the recommendation that a broad geographical base that took into account the sizes of the contingents from the various contributing countries should be used in selecting civilian police commissioners and appointing other senior police personnel for peacekeeping operations .  
While in future United Nations peacekeeping operations great importance would be attached to national reconciliation as a basis for lasting peace , a situation in which reconciliation and national healing were impossible in the existing circumstances should also be foreseen .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
Enhance the rapid deployment capacity of the Logistics Base by providing the best service possible to newly established peacekeeping missions and also to strengthen the logistics support of existing peacekeeping missions by taking action in a timely fashion on material release orders as follows : immediate operational requirements in 24 hours , urgent requests in 7 days and routine requests in 15 to 21 days ;  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
While it recognized the distinct nature of peacekeeping operations and humanitarian activities , it also saw a need to grapple with the unfortunate reality , which increasingly required the Department to take a proactive role in protecting humanitarian assistance in complex conflict situations .  
Statements I , II and III contain financial results for all United Nations peacekeeping funds , which are broken down into three groups of related funds and consolidated into a grand total reflecting all individual peacekeeping accounts of the Organization . 
There remained a huge disparity between military expenditure at the national level and the resources set aside at the international level for preventative diplomacy , peacemaking and peacekeeping .  
The substantive part of the declaration should help to strengthen the legal basis for peacekeeping operations , both in the preparatory phase and in their implementation , with regard to all their economic , financial , political and human aspects .  
The Special Committee stresses the importance of having senior military commanders , police commissioners and key staff personnel selected , prepared and trained prior to their deployment to a peacekeeping operation .  
First , peacekeeping operations must be endowed with a clear , realistic mandate commensurate with the established goals and backed by the necessary political , military and moral decisions .  
Consequently , peacekeeping operations were becoming larger and more costly , and total peacekeeping expenditure for the current fiscal year was expected to be more than double that for the preceding fiscal year .  
Preparing comprehensive military operational plans for new peacekeeping operations , participating in fact finding missions to current and potential mission areas and , as required , revising and modifying plans for current operations ;  
The current ad hoc peacekeeping scale should be replaced by a stable , transparent , equitable and effective mechanism based on objective economic criteria .  
The Committee recognized the increasing need for the participation of female personnel , on a broad geographical basis , in all aspects of peacekeeping operations and encouraged the development and implementation of innovative strategies to further that aim .  
Mr . Halbwachs ( Controller ) said , in reply to a question posed by the Cuban delegation at the preceding meeting , that the level of financial and human resources proposed for the support account was adequate to support current peacekeeping operations .  
His delegation earnestly hoped that the question would be addressed during the current debate in a spirit of mutual accommodation and understanding , with the sole objective of ensuring a secure financial foundation for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
In view of the vital role which peacekeeping operations played in a world plagued by regional and intraState conflicts , it was important to provide the financial , human and logistical resources needed for the effective fulfilment of their mandates .  
Unfortunately , the peacekeeping resources of the Organization are not limitless , and they must be apportioned in the best possible way , in a manner commensurate with the real danger posed by a given conflict to regional and global stability .  
The Council can act with a view to monitoring and ensuring compliance with current Council resolutions ; improving communication and coordination with other United Nations organs and authoritative bodies involved in the protection of civilians , particularly children ; ensuring that the post-conflict environment nurtures the rights and needs of children , including rehabilitation , which is integral to future stability and development ; and ensuring that the it takes an integrated and interdisciplinary approach and gives due consideration to the rights of children when considering peacekeeping operations .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
That is a severe disappointment , but it was a prudent decision based on the current and growing level of peacekeeping activity and the need for sufficient cash to cover the requirements for these ongoing missions .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
The unbudgeted expenditure of $ 65,200 was required to meet peacekeeping related increases in workload for both the Peacekeeping Financing Division and the Accounts Division in connection with the establishment and start up of the three new missions and the expansion of an existing mission , as well as outstanding tasks remaining for completed and closed operations .  
Objective : To ensure timely and effective administrative and logistical support to peacekeeping operations , as well as other activities in the field authorized by the United Nations , and an effective , proactive and coordinated response to threats from landmines and unexploded ordnance .  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
Decides to apply the unencumbered balance of 1,300,900 dollars from the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 , inclusive of 1,273,000 dollars in miscellaneous and interest income , and to prorate the balance of 75,846,200 dollars gross ( 66,562,500 dollars net ) among the individual active peacekeeping operation budgets , to meet the resources required for the support account for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 . 
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
East Timor is a good example of the need for the international community to build on a successful peacekeeping intervention by laying the political , economic , judicial and constitutional foundations for lasting peace and security .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
The comprehensive review has identified the need for enhancements within the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General to ensure that it has adequate capacity to meet the demands and requirements of both the Office and the field missions , capability for identifying the policies , tools and capacities needed for future peacekeeping operations , and capable of ensuring effective integration of activities within the Office of Mission Support and the Department .  
Position required to address deficiencies in the level of resources dedicated to the Asia and Middle East region : provides support for the chief on financial management of peacekeeping offices in the Asia and Middle East region , actions day-to-day correspondence , monitors status of allotments reports , assists unit with general administrative and clerical functions , responsible for coordinating unit reporting exercises and compilation of information ( IMIS ) for analysis by the chief .  
It will coordinate geographical analysis requirements within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations , collect , evaluate and disseminate geographic information for peacekeeping operations , prepare the GIS-related portion of policies , guidelines and standard operating procedures and establish an engineers online Intranet site within the existing Global WAN of the Department , including maintaining the engineering database for FACS . 5.100 The following three additional posts are requested for the Engineering Service : 
The incumbent will be responsible for overall planning , review of field mission budget requirements , resource planning , engineering designs for horizontal and vertical construction , inclusive of modular / prefabricated facilities , and general oversight on and coordinated execution of the mandated engineering programme and related support activities in the peacekeeping operations , ensuring that effective support is rendered in a timely and economical manner .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
In addition , the peacekeeping vehicle fleet is more varied and more technically sophisticated than ever before , and represents a significant investment by the Member States , which necessitates the promulgation of operating practices and professional development programmes for its motor transport specialists and its vehicle operators and their supervisors to ensure that maximum utility is obtained from these assets with the lowest practicable operating costs . 
Once the revised budgets for missions in transition ( UNMEE , UNAMSIL , MONUC and UNIFIL ) and for the support account for peacekeeping operations , with the proposed resource requirements resulting from the comprehensive review and capacity study , have been considered by the General Assembly , budget levels are projected to increase over the initial current level of $ 1.7-billion to some slightly in excess of $ 3.0-billion for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
The resources for ALU , which are insufficient to handle the existing workload , are totally inadequate to address the recommendations in the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to : ( a ) improve administrative support to the missions by reducing the otherwise unavoidable delays in handling their disciplinary matters ; and ( b ) allow for more support and training of administrative personnel in peacekeeping through lessons learned and guidelines .  
It is proposed to strengthen the Training Unit by two Professional ( 1 P-3 and 1-P-2 ) and one Security Service post to provide more comprehensive central training for security officers seconded or appointed to new and / or expanded peacekeeping operations on firearms qualification and certification , incident command system , dignitary protection , advanced security skills , United Nations use-of-force policy , emergency operations , investigations , fire and safety regulations , defensive tactics and advance first-aid provision . 
Responsibilities would include providing Intranet access to all peacekeeping missions ; designing and enhancing the Intranet to facilitate the sharing of sensitive information among restricted groups ; coordinating with field offices , installing hardware and software as required and provide ongoing technical support to servers , firewalls and related components of the infrastructure dedicated to the Intranet ;  
The Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit will be considerably strengthened and is intended to be at the heart of a new system by which the Organization learns from its peacekeeping experience , developing policies , procedures and related operational tools that are incorporated into the planning and conduct of both ongoing and future missions .  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
In order to enable OHCHR to provide adequate , systematic and prompt substantive support and to facilitate links with the broader United Nations human rights programme , there is a need to strengthen its capacity for daily advice and substantive backstopping to the increasing number of peacekeeping operations with human rights components .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
The present report therefore focuses on actual cash inflows as at 30 September 2001 , as well as cash payments expected during the last quarter of this year based on information received from Member States and on prior payment patterns , both in the aggregate and by category that is , the regular budget , peacekeeping and the international tribunals .  
Four distinct functional elements are delineated ( peacekeeping best practices and policy , public information , gender and peacekeeping and the Resource Centre ) , for which 19 new posts are requested ( 13 Professional and 6 General Service ( Other level ) ) , in addition to the current staffing of 8 .  
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective public information programmes in peacekeeping operations and the need to carefully identify and implement those programmes on the basis of objectives tailored to the specific needs of the missions concerned , including adequate resources for those programmes ( see A / 55 / 839 , para .  44 ) .  
The plan provides for an integrated peacekeeping mission headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General , which would be composed of a military component , a civilian police component , and a small civilian component , including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration .  The latter component will be essential to the functioning of the government in the immediate post-independence period .  
The Secretariat , which shared responsibility for the effective functioning of the Organization , should strive for efficiency by improving its billing system : the ability of States to meet the 30-day payment window for peacekeeping assessments would be greatly enhanced if the Secretariat provided an indicative schedule of assessment dates . 
The Sudan renewed its commitment to its position of principle advocating respect for the norms of international humanitarian law , bilateral agreements and national legislation on the part of all parties involved in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations , and it called for full account to be taken of the guiding principles for humanitarian assistance annexed to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
The Committee sought clarification with regard to the procedures to be followed in respect of budgeting for additional support account requirements related to UNIFIL and was informed that it was the intention of the Secretary-General , on the basis of whatever decision the General Assembly might take regarding the additional resources under the support account for peacekeeping operations , to prorate the financing of the additional support account resources approved among the upcoming revised financial resolutions for the missions , whose updated budgets will be considered during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly . 
As the worlds largest democracy , with enormous potential and rapidly growing economic power , and being a major contributor to peacekeeping operations , India has a natural claim to a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council .  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Develop and implement as well as strengthen already existing training programmes for law enforcement officers , prison officers , medical officers and judicial personnel , as well as United Nations personnel , including peacekeeping staff , to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of threatened and abused women and children infected with HIV / AIDS , including intravenous drug users , female inmates and orphans ;  
The data for this survey shall identify the common and essential additional costs from existing troop levels related to personnel that are incurred by troop-contributing countries due to their participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations , including the establishment of a standard vaccination package and identification of mission-specific vaccines and mission-specific medical and biochemical examinations , using the data available from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Childrens Fund , that could be liable for reimbursement ;
