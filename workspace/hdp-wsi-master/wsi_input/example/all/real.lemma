- - Operate in real accordance with international practices .  Take the internationally prevailing " Free Trade Zone " as a reference objective .  Adopt " inside the territory but outside the customs " as the jurisdiction model .  Gradually realize the free circulation of personnel , goods , funds between the zone and overseas , and realize full coupling with international markets .  
Employees in foreign invested enterprises are dispersed across industries , the real estate public service industry , the commerce and catering service industries , the construction industry , the farming , forestry , animal husbandry , side-line production and fishery industries , and the traffic , transport , and postal industries .  In recent years , some Chinese employees have gone to work in some sporadically appearing foreign capital financial institutions .  
The areas in which Liaoning utilizes foreign investment have been expanded from medium and small-sized processing projects to the four pillar industries for old industrial base transformation purposes : the petrochemical industry , the metallurgical industry , the mechanical industry , the electronic industry , etc . and such industries as agriculture , real estate , infrastructure , energy , finance , etc .  
The funds raised by " Shenye Holding Company " this time will primarily be invested in developing intercity bus service , national car rental network , and in the existing real estate projects , to build up an integrated enterprise with Hong Kong as a base and Shenzhen as a business focus .  
At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .  Immediately the launchers will be asked to launch a missile .  This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
The course of cross-strait relations in the last five years proves again that it will be only by acting in line with the " one China , two countries " principle , holding cross-strait political talks , to end the hostile cross-strait state as soon as possible , that will really end over a century of Chinese humiliation and territorial division by the great powers , and really achieve China 's complete reunification and a real renaissance of the Chinese nation , to achieve the longstanding dream of the Chinese people to become a strong country .  
Public security Minister Jia Chunwang pointed out at a news briefing held today : The public security organs at all levels must adhere to the guiding principle of taking the initiative to grasp problems in real earnest and on an earlier date and should firmly keep the initiative in work .  Grasping problems in real earnest does not mean staging a show for the leaders and masses .  Rather , it means daring to crack hard nuts in real earnest ;  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
Though a myriad of contradictions have yet to be tackled and countless difficulties yet to be overcome in the historical process of national rejuvenation through science and education , so long as we forge ahead in face of difficulties and implement the party 's relevant policies in real earnest , our national rejuvenation through science and education is bound to dutifully accomplish its mission by creating new brilliance in the course of the Chinese nation 's great rejuvenation .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
They must solidly solve well various urgent problems which affect the people 's lives and are important to the general situation of reform , development and stability .  We must resolutely prevent and overcome bureaucratic working styles such as being detached from the masses and taking advantage of official posts .  We must resolutely prevent and overcome formalist working styles such as pursuing undeserved reputations and paying no attention to real results .  
It seems that the United States is only accustomed to a relationship in which it gives the orders and other countries obey , and is not yet accustomed to living on equal terms with other countries ; it is only accustomed to living in an impossible uniform world regulated by itself , and is not yet accustomed to living in the real pluralistic world .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
If our military 's writers and artists can achieve these , they can obtain the rich source material contained in various new and typical aspects of society , reflect the real spirit of the times accurately and in a lively manner , and create highly concise , perfect and successful works with clear characteristics of the times .  
When the training entered the stage of camouflage concentration target confrontation , offices and soldiers of the " red army " set up concentration targets , such as real and false artillery positions , missile positions , and field airports using camouflage to make true targets invisible while leaving false targets exposed , such as shaped defilade , smoke screen , and false target .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
Third , to verify the situation of personnel structure and personnel change of the central budget units , and understand in detail the manning quota of the budget units , the actual number and structure of the staff , and the situation of actual average expenditure per person for every outlay in order to provide basic numbers for determining the standard of a fixed number of staff and fixed quotas which meet the real situation .  
Being showy and not substantial , some people made false reports , exaggerated , practiced formalism , sought superficial grandeur , and paid no attention to real results .  Instead of accomplishing something , they only managed to deal with the higher levels ' inspections and assessments .  Although they accomplished nothing , their reports were closely reasoned and well argued .  
Non-governmental economic cooperation has evolved from individual corporate ones to the stage of establishing " special economic zones " and industrial parks .  Increasing economic and trade cooperation and personnel exchanges have helped increase mutual understanding and trust , which not only bring real benefits for the people of the two Koreas but produce a positive impact on the improvement of the north-south relationship .  
The supervision and control of the leading cadres is a regular , arduous task that requires the relentless efforts of the party organizations at all levels , but it is also a real and urgent task that requires the party organizations to make very sure that the supervision and control measures are implemented in accordance with their supervisory and control duties .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Second , reform has led to the monetization of economy and the deepening of finance , the former distribution in kind was gradually changed to distribution in money at real market prices ( the recent reform to suspend welfare housing distribution is an example ) , and the simple and unitary financial product previously provided by commercial banks has become complex and diversified .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .  Before engaging in real fire exercises the troops are already prepared with a fair amount of practice in operational skills , even using simulation to train for weapons systems that have yet to become operational .  
In order to accelerate the steps towards making a leap in training , we should extract from past " exhibitions " and " briefings " on real technology based on existing computer networks to train the troops , and rely on all training bases ' extensive opening up of simulated training to enable the troops to become familiar with and master information technology and equipment as soon as possible .  At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
For example , some people have laid stress on their professional work while making light of theory .  According to these people , theory is soft and nominal , and it makes no difference how much theoretical knowledge one will master ; whereas professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology is solid and real , and one 's knowledge in this aspect can be measured easily .  
For instance , after the Central Military Commission decided the military troops " should not be involved in doing business " but " live on royal food " , the military cut down the real estate scale and stopped its real estate business .  In this situation , how should the military implement an effective administration and prevent its assets from flowing away ?  
People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
Nevertheless , the commanders delivered quick judgments on and decisively handled all kinds of situations , ensured that the group army campaign succeeded in its attempts , concealed the real things and displayed bogus ones , launched three-dimensional attacks , and struck in depth and breath .  The " red army " finally surrounded and annihilated the " enemy " positional defense after two days and nights of tough contests .  
On site , the writer saw a series of situations being sent to the directorial center in real time and promptly .  They included whether the commanders could rapidly and accurately make judgments on enemy situations , whether they could make scientific decisions , whether instructions could be sent to affiliated combat troops amid electronic interference , whether troops could trust deep into the enemy force and take up position as scheduled and according to instructions , and whether information on the enemy could be handled effectively .  
Education must be based on real wars .  Teachers of the college meticulously design curriculums close to reality , train and mold students through such curricular activities as the " blue Classroom " , " social Classroom " , " international Classroom " and " classroom of War Simulations " .  And they have transformed high-tech knowledge into combat abilities in their students .  
It only showed that the strike distance of a weapon was greatly extended .  The real integration of information with firepower is embodied in the guided weapons .  They include the earliest guided missiles of passive target-detection such as that of infrared target detection guidance and electromagnetic wave guidance , and the various precision guided weapons of the present .  
All levels should regard improving leadership styles and doing well the positive three Stresses education as the concrete embodiment of carrying out the requirements of the " Three Representations " , as a real action of focusing on grassroots units and laying solid foundations , and as an important indicator of reinforcing and developing the achievements of the " Three Stresses " education held for Party committees at levels higher than the regiment .  
" It is difficult to draw a human being but it is easy to draw a ghost " .  This is how the Chinese describe tricks aimed at deceiving people with fabricated stories , meaning that it is difficult to deceive people with what is real or can be seen but easy to lead people astray with what is absurd or preposterous .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
They aim for the target of accomplishing combat task requirements without going through real battle training and without replenishing personnel and equipment .  Through reform of flight training , this unit has realized new breakthroughs in combat strength in the following five areas .  In the area of basic flight skill training , flying has been evolved from normal conditions to flying under bad weather conditions or under other extreme conditions .  
Applying all kinds of advanced simulation equipment and methods ; simulating an almost real combat situation ; putting trainees onto a lively , specific , complex and changing modernized battlefield ; creating a rich battlefield environment ; and allowing the trainees to train in technology , tactics , strategy , and command in a near-real combat situation ; this is the necessary trend for military training development in all nations of the world , and is also the resting place for China 's science and technology to train the troops .  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
Looking at the changes in market prices , the main impact came from the big rise in international oil prices and domestic policy-style price adjustments , and the real impact from being drawn forward by expanded market demand was still rather weak .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .  
Building up the foundation and devoting effort to implementation are a process of endless circles and spiral ascent , which require repeated effort and effort at repetition .  However , this repetition is not simply a mechanical repetition on a low level ; instead , it requires that we should - - along with the deepening of reform , development of the situation , and the real situation of the units - - continuously adapt ourselves to new issues , study new problems and resolve new contradictions .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
They said that China had for a long time provided unconditional economic assistance to the African continent , and even though China is not Africa 's major creditor , this action taken by China as a developing country is indicative of its sincere hope to join Africa in realizing the common development aspiration within the framework of South-South cooperation .  Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
To build on progress and create greater glories , we must consider the constant improvement of the people 's standard of living to be the fundamental starting point for all of our work .  While we continue to take care of everyday affairs for the people year after year , we must join together to make some major accomplishments that all of the people of Beijing can see and feel , and that will bring even more real benefits to the people in the city and in outlying areas .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
It is understood that the development of this large piece of training equipment , which can conduct total-system simulation of real equipment , was tackled as an assault mission and completed in three months by a " shock brigade " made up of 29 experts at the college .  It was over seven times more efficient than conventional development , providing strong technical support for the fast generation of combat capability from new equipment .  
To ensure that research work could be fulfilled on time , the brigade held a forum with local government and captains of some fishing boats to exchange views in a bid to improve the research findings .  They also formulated plans for a real army-civilian joint mine-sweeping drill , organized and completed a map inference for joint mine-sweeping operations .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
The list of US arms sales to Taiwan has been generally decided .  Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held that safeguarding national security is the consistent stand of the ruling and opposition parties .  He also stressed that Taiwan must not pay attention to the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war . "  He said that obtaining weapons does not necessarily mean ensuring national defense security , and national defense security alone is not equivalent to national security and that real national security must have political support , which means stable cross-strait relations .  
Recently , while the US stock market was falling again and again , Taiwan 's stock market did not follow suit and even slightly rose .  The key for this lay in the existence of the mainland conceptual stocks formed by the Taiwan businessmen 's investment in the mainland , the opening of B shares on the mainland stock market , and the booming real estate market on the mainland side .  All these factors effectively played a role in supporting Taiwan 's stock market .  
The wireless digital tactical graphic terminal developed by the regiment through cooperation with a certain research institution can transmit real time pictures from the forward position and the front line ; it can also transmit quality still pictures .  As a result , the task of reconnaissance , monitoring , tracking , and information collection can be conducted in a more timely and convenient manner .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .  Whenever conditions allow , we should stage training exercises involving students from various military academies and schools , commanding officers from various units , and command organs from the units set to play a key role in such exercises , thus enabling all personnel concerned to handle the same situation together , and the general departments should organize and send personnel to examine and appraise training results .  
Since its independence , India has already established an intelligence organization which is fully equipped and functional .  On the surface , it does not seem to be as famous as the CIA of the United States , KGB of the Soviet Union , MI5 of Britain , and Mossad of Israel but just as confidential as the intelligence work should be , Indian is quietly and secretly doing its intelligence work and achieving real results which are not necessarily a bit less outstanding than others .  
In mid May , officers from the northwestern operation department under the General Staff Headquarters and the military command academy and specialists in military science jointly organized an operation drill to oppose pro-Taiwan independence forces ' attempt to liberate Taiwan and as an effort to put down their rebellions .  This operation drill was launched with high technology at a simulated battlefield , set up based on the ratio of a real war battlefield .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It is true that the party , before long after its establishment , realized that , in light of the Chinese real situation of a semicolonial and semi-feudalistic society , the party should give priority to toppling imperialist and feudalistic forces over the immediate establishment of a socialist society not to mention a communist society , a task for far ahead in the future .  
and four Armed Forces Awards for Scientific and Technological Advancement , Third Class . Tao Qian , an officer with a doctorate degree in science of military campaigns , recently demonstrated his ability in the base that the military region built for combined campaign training exercises .  His remarkable performance in teaching the theory of organized campaigns and directing a real exercise has made him the pacesetter of the military region in providing the armed forces with science and technology training .  
The development and change of the post-Cold War international security situation shows that apart from cooperative security mechanism , the other mechanisms have not played or will also impossibly play , in the real terms , the role as patron saint in regional security , because the security based on those mechanisms is built on the basis of the others ' insecurity and is the refurbished version of the historical old security mechanism with hegemonist coloration .  
We should create a warm , joyful , united , inspiring atmosphere around the main theme , and should organize various activities with the spirit of innovation by improving the work style , stressing real results , preventing waste and extravagance , and opposing formalism . 
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
Party organizations at all levels are urged to push forward the building of grassroots party organizations with an innovative mind , integrate in real terms the work of party building at the grassroots level with the reality of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , take earnest steps to enhance the effectiveness of their work , and give better play to the role of grassroots party organizations as a strong fighting force ;  
do a good job of the logistic work in the preparations for military struggle and of logistic reform and innovation with high demands and the spirit of the speech as the base , by centering on the party 's objective of endeavor and historical mission in the new century , and in line with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission , and realize adequate logistic support in real terms ;  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Our workers in the field of philosophy and social science should follow Secretary Jiang 's demands and " take our direction from Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , planting our feet on the real achievements of constructing a Chinese-style socialism , setting our eyes on the progress of development of world social science and culture , and constantly developing healthy , upward striving , rich and colorful socialism with Chinese style and special Chinese characteristics . "  
The appointment of certain a retired lieutenant colonel of the national armed forces by the name of Liu to be a regimental commander with the rank of colonel in the Nanjing Military Region is the first case in which the Chinese communists have appointed a turncoat of Taiwan 's national armed forces as field commanding officer with real power .  
It has been learned that the new newspaper to be published next month is a quarto color daily with 32 pages each day .  The authorities have promised that as long as the " orientation " is correct , the newspaper can make independent decisions on the policy for publishing reports , the scope for gathering news , and the arrangement for different columns .  The newspaper can also be operated entirely according to market requirements and is expected to be the real metropolitan newspaper of Shenzhen .  
Governments at all levels should have the resolve and should take strong measures against the illegal activities of manufacturing and selling counterfeit and shoddy goods , outlaw all places used for manufacturing and selling counterfeit goods , smash narrow-minded local protectionism and regional economic blockade , smash the monopoly of industries and trades , establish unified national markets , encourage enterprises to compete by fair means , and give shape to a market competition mechanism in real terms by which only the best will survive .  
We should try to find out the real situation , analyze current developments , pay close attention to both the key areas and the weak links of our work , lay stress on the work at the township and town level , and work out measures to ensure a sound fulfillment of responsibilities .  
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
The theoretical study central group of the party group of the organs of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative studied once again Jiang Zemin 's " 1 July " important speech in a concentrated and thoroughgoing way in close connection with the realities in the CPPCC organs and implemented the spirit of the speech in real earnest .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
They should establish their footing on the current situation of the country , advance with the time , break new grounds , pay attention primarily to studying the important issues in real life , draw the rich resources and strong power for their theoretical innovation from reforms , opening up and modernization drive , closely follow the trend of world development , and profoundly understand the laws for contemporary China 's economic and social development .  
We have also asserted that China and Japan are close neighbors separated by only a strip of water , the two countries used to have friendly exchanges in history , and we have the wish to live on friendly terms with the Japanese people for generations to come .  However , when saying this , we must never forget an indispensable precondition , that is , the Japanese in our time must give up in real terms the policy of militarism which was pursued by their sinful forefathers .  
give ever wider publicity to and strengthen theoretical research in comprehensive management of public security , gradually establish and perfect a spending support mechanism , vigorously strengthen the building of the contingent of workers engaged in comprehensive management of public security , improve work styles in real earnest , and make sure that the various measures for comprehensive management of public security are implemented down to village ( residential ) households and individuals .  
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
Indeed , the regiment 's " red unit " and " blue unit " managed to refine each other 's tactics step by step during each round of fighting , by exposing each other 's loopholes , refining each other 's tactics , improving each other 's training plans , developing new tactics , and conducting training in light of a real war .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
ensured the development of two major industries , such as agriculture and animal husbandry and the telecommunications industry ; downsized such industries as retail marketing , international trade , real estate , petrochemical , auto , and motor vehicle manufacturing industries ; and supported the development of major industries by selling stock rights and recovering parts of the investment .

But the real , behind-the-scenes reason stemmed from the powerful backers of these two Yancheng " Party and government hands . "  Six years ago when Municipal Party Committee Secretary Xu Guojian was transferred to serve as director of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee Organization , Xu Qiyao enticed the boss of a construction company to inform against Xu Guojian for accepting a bribe of 100,000 yuan .

They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .  
The secondary industry which is heavily based on high-tech and advanced sciences provides the real strength behind the tertiary industry 's development , and in turn the tertiary industry 's development provides the vast space and the technological and information services that allow the secondary industry to gear its operating funds to the market , and it also absorbs millions of the secondary industry 's surplus labor force , producing the effect of the secondary and tertiary industries promoting each other 's development .  
Measures should be taken to ensure that the salaries of staff and workers in the administrative units and public institutions are paid in full and on time , resolve the problem of salaries in arrears that exists in the units at county and township levels in real earnest , and further do a good job of the unified payment of salaries and financial expenses in the party and government organs and educational departments .

"  
They should further cultivate a pure party spirit ; find correct answers , ideologically and in real terms , to such fundamental questions as " what they have joined revolution for , what they should do as a cadre nowadays , and what they should leave behind in the future " ; check erroneous ideas at the outset , and be on high alert all the time , and make sure that they can take every correct step in their life .  
We must stick to the principle that both material progress and spiritual progress should be promoted in real earnest , with neither aspect being neglected .

From their practice of changing Jilin'sbackward look , the city party committee and the city government of Jilin have learned that to bring the spiritual civilization building into factories , mines , and communities in real terms , what counts is to introduce a new practice of activating the ideological-political work from bottom to top instead of the other way round , and to move the foothold of the work from the previous practice of holding oneself responsible for higher authorities to a new practice of holding oneself responsible for lower levels .  
ensure meticulous organization ; and firmly grasp in real earnest this as a major issue bearing on overall interests of reform , development , and stability in such a spirit as holding ourselves highly responsible to the people and history .  Our primary task at the moment is : The governments at all levels should implement and carry out to the letter the central authorities ' present policy measures on social security ;

Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian .

It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Beijing is strong in the fields of science and technology , personnel , intelligence and information , which form a solid foundation for the development of the high-tech industry .

Answering a question on the activities of some " Tibet independence " advocates now living abroad , Lhaba Pingcuo said : Owing to the Dalai Lama and the handful of people who attempt to split the motherland and some Western media 's untrue and distorted reports , some ethnic Tibetan countrymen living overseas still do not know the real situation in Tibet .  
Since the beginning of 2000 , the volume of contracted foreign investment has rapidly recovered and begun to climb up , driven by the effect of the pending WTO accession and a major turnaround in China 's domestic economy .  However , the volume of actual foreign investment continued to drop , due to the delayed effect from the drop of contracted foreign investment in the previous year .

Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .

"

Members noted an information paper reporting on research that applied the p-star model , developed by the US Federal Reserve System , to Hong Kong to test the hypothesis that an excess real money balance implied potential inflationary pressure in the future .  
This round of the survey covers about 61 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the construction sector , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .  
Among the main economic activities , significant real output growth was recorded for communications ( 11.1% ) in the first quarter of 2002 , attributable mainly to a notable increase in the traffic volumes of international telephone and mobile phone services ( Table 4 ) .  
On invisible trade , in view of the broad-based and robust upturn in exports of services extending into the second quarter , and also the continuing impetus notably from inbound tourism and offshore trade , the forecast growth rate in real terms of exports of services in 2002 is revised up to 9% in the present update , from 5.5% as put out earlier .  
This round of the survey covers about 57 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the construction sector , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .

Yet for the community , social and personal services sector and the transport , storage and communications sector , nominal increases of 0.1% and 1.5% were recorded respectively .  
With ocean cargo flows to the United States returning to normal by now , and even allowing for some downside in the export performance for the remaining two months of the year , the forecast growth rate in real terms of total exports of goods in 2002 is still lifted , to 7.1% in the current update , from 5.4% as put out earlier .  
Within the total exports of goods , the forecast increase in real terms in re-exports is raised to 9% from 7% , but the forecast decline in real terms in domestic exports is lowered to 9% from 8% , with the latter adjustment reflecting an accentuated structural shift away from domestic exports to re-exports and offshore trade . 
Overall investment spending in the economy , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is now expected to decline by 4.1% in real terms in 2002 , up from the earlier forecast of a 4.8% fall .  
This was made possible by using advanced videoconferencing technology through the connection of high-speed broadband network using Internet2 technology , which supports reliable and high quality real time multi-parties interactive communication among different networks at different geographical locations which are vastly separated . 
This round of the survey covers about 67 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the construction sector , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .  
This round of the survey covers about 58 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .

Sub-sectors with moderate increases were the real estate ( up by 8.2% ) and the business services ( 5.1% ) .  On the other hand , employment in all the other selected major sectors decreased .  In particular , the number of manual workers at construction sites showed the largest decline , by 13.3% .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
This round of the survey covers about 52 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , fell back by 5.3% in real terms in the second quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , following a 3.5% rise in the first quarter . 
The forecast rate of change in real terms in overall investment spending in the economy in 2003 , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is broadly unchanged at - 5.4% , as against - 5.5% put out earlier .

In the U . S . , the three main TV networks have similar programs , such as " Issues &amp; Answers " on ABC , " Meet the Press " on NBC , and " Face the Nation " On CBS . Government officials in the Republic of China have often appeared on TV , but in most cases they made speeches in a stiff , official manner and confined themselves to formal announcements and outlines rather than giving " inside information " of real interest to the public .  
The tao tsang or canons ( accepted texts ) of all Taoist scriptures were divided into three tungs . The root meaning of the word tung is cave , but it also means " to communicate , to understand the mysteries . " The term thus evokes the mysterious mountain grottoes , real or imaginary , harboring hidden revelations and dealings with the sacred powers .  
The sky above and ocean below framed a picturesque scene , the sails arching almost to their tearing point , the array of gaily painted boats , and the muscles of well-built , powerful sailors responding to the pounding of the waves against their sailboats . The champion of this event , an American air-force pilot named Jack who sails in his spare time , described man 's battle on the aquatic battlefield : " This was real sailing !  
Lee survived her college years because she learned early when and to whom it would be safe to speak from her heart , when to conceal her true thoughts , and how to avoid beatings or the excruciating pain of being brainwashed . " I was always nervous , " she says , " not knowing when the Red Guards would find out my real feelings .  
On February 15 , President Chiang Ching-kuo was nominated for re-election as president of the Republic of China . In accepting the unanimous decision of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang , Chiang said he was a " willing soldier ready to go back to the battlefield with a fighting spirit . " Although the choice came as no real surprise , it confirmed the wide support and popularity he has among the entire population .  
Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair . Many companies feel they are the victims says one official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , but the real damage is done to the country as a whole . The goal of economic upgrading and technological progress will be thwarted if this belief persists .  
During the shooting of the film Dr . Ngor , still with vivid pictures in his mind about his ordeal , often expressed his displeasure to the producer and director that the film was n't explicit enough in showing the true terror of what went on . Although many of his suggestions were incorporated into the film , many were not because the producer felt it would be too brutal , too real to be accepted as the truth .  
Although Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio does not lack for beautiful ghosts , in popular legend their beauty is just a disguise ; their real features are hideous and terrible , an impression confirmed in the common expression " as ugly as a ghost . "  
He did n't have enough cash on him so he asked to have one held and to pay for it after he finished his show and got his money . " No wonder they are fascinated . Each bonsai is a miniature world all its own , rich in human interest , that can set the spirit soaring to a place where , poised between the real and the imaginary , we wander among the hills and valleys of our dreams . (  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
The free , impressionistic side of Chinese painting is reflected in the way Peking opera simplifies and abstracts , mixing the real and the unreal to create a unique aesthetic synthesis . And Chinese painting 's meticulous brushwork is mirrored in Peking opera by the extreme concentration paid to every gesture and intonation . "  
One of the real contributions of this congress was to establish a process for the input of public opinion through the nominating system for the Central Committee , for which half the nominees were selected by the chairman and half by petition among the delegates . The vote was by secret ballot of all the delegates , increasing the supervisory role of the base level vis-a-vis the center while making the latter more sensitive to the former .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
What 's awful are the bombs through the telephone , the salvo of alarming rings expanding the battleground from the mailbox outside the door to the soft underbelly of the study , the silent movie changed to sensur-round sound , the imaginary enemy shooting with real bullets .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
Remarkably , retailers are falling over themselves to cut prices for items such as compact discs , furniture , home appliances , automobiles and antiques , none of which are subject to seasonal fluctuations . And prices for gold , real estate and land , normally much sought after as a hedge against inflation , have not only failed to rise rapidly , some are actually falling at an astonishing rate .  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
" The real issue is whether agency heads have the determination and guts to exercise their assessment responsibilities , " points out Hsu Yu-fu . The basic status of civil servants is guaranteed by law and they can not be cashiered lightly ; meanwhile those dismissed with a " D " grading will lose their pension entitlement , so departmental heads shrink from drastic action from sympathetic considerations and to avoid a backlash , which , means there is no effective way of weeding out unsuitable personnel . "  
" The age of the solo aerial combat hero is over , the tendency in the modern air force is towards group tactics requiring a high level of coordination between friendly aircraft . " Commandant Chuang Chung-i goes on to explain that the students ' most common mistake is not giving clear enough instructions , so that an advantage only ten seconds away is lost through delay . " In a real combat situation , that would mean being shot down and killed . "  
Yao Yi-wei argues that the most artistic , refined drama is one that meticulously " makes the unreal real , " whereas " making the real unreal " is rampant in society . Legislators who throw fists in front of the cameras can be amiable and laughing the instant they are out of the lens . This type of even more bizarre , more stimulating " performance " has diverted society 's attention . Who 's around to appreciate the real artists giving their all on stage ?  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
His strange dress and vulgar language might have sold a million recordings , maintained the critic , but this kind of marketing would certainly shorten his real musical career . The response from the musician was to strip off his conventional dinner suit and black tie during a performance of Bach , revealing a garish purple jacket and shirt . He then accused the critic of making classical music an issue of class and the preserve of the elite .  
Chen Er-nan , a planner / designer at Hong Jian Industries , which accounts for half of the domestic market in man-made polyesters , says that natural silk is colder to the touch , that it is more rough and textured when rubbed , and that real silk lets air pass through , making it more comfortable to wear . Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
Pacific Construction , a real estate company chain that adopted a lot of parks , found itself scolded by some city council members as engaged in advertising and commercial activities , maybe because its signs were too conspicuous . " We thought we were going to raise our corporate image , and instead we spent all that money and wound up getting yelled at , " they say , feeling much abused .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Maintain Flexibility : Big corporations invest not only in real estate , they also invest in the restaurant , dry goods , and gift industries , consequently merging several stores to become a largescale shopping center . Restaurants have also become beautifully decorated with service provided by equally well adorned girls . This is a direct challenge to established enterprises . "  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
Casual and easygoing in real life , she came to the studio dressed in a house robe and slippers , just like the character she played , which was down-home , offbeat and outspoken . Even though hers was only a supporting role , her natural , unaffected style of acting won over audiences and made the show a hit , boosting her career to new heights .  
For example , the Lungshan Temple in Lukang could be listed as a world class artifact . The quality of the construction , the interior environment , and the primitive construction have all been preserved rather well . In particular , having National Heritage Award winner Wang Kun-shan 's nan-kuan troupe inside gave the old temple real vitality ; I really loved that .  
First of all , father became much more clearheaded and even his extra workload could not ruffle his calm tranquility . Then there was mother , who became even more concerned about people , often asking my younger brother 's fellow students to come over and eat . My elder brothers also gradually grew less vain as they turned to the pursuit of real inner worth .  
Take Taipei as an example : Heavy traffic flows along the main roads and spreads out into narrow lanes which are full of parked cars and motorcycles ; real plans to give pedestrians more space are limited with expanded tiny sidewalks becoming spaces for illegal parking and crudely designed underpasses turning into dark , no-go areas .  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
Also , Lisa 's grasp of the computer profession is so good that she can be very faithful and fluent , and she can translate concisely while maintaining the subtle innuendos and insinuating tones . " For example , she used a slang term in Taiwanese meaning " Is that real ? " to express the dubious veracity of an event . She described the end of a big computer exhibition as a " leftover meal . " Such succinct and incisive language causes readers to infuse their own imagination into the spaces of the text .  
He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .  
In his simple and idealistic visual presentations , Ku Shih-yung , who has won the Taipei Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art two times running , is neither making an argument nor a statement of protest , nor trying to describe anything at all . Rather he creates a dialectic between the real and imaginary to stimulate people 's memories and thus bring them into his philosophical utopia .  
And the cost of making installations far exceeds paintings or sculptures . " This is an extravagant way of opposing commercialism , refusing to be coerced in any way , determinedly pursuing one 's own ideas and boldly striking out in new directions . But it is also possible that the artist will just give up when facing the setbacks of the real world , " says a suffering Huang Wen-hao , sounding sometimes high spirited and sometimes down and out .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
Some people have criticized Tsui Hark 's Huang Fei-hong as " superficial " and lacking the real martial skills of a great master . The constant use of ropes , of special effects which go beyond the humanly and physically possible , and of speededup action , the all-pervading Chinese popular aesthetic , the dramatic camera angles , the melodramatic dialogues and plot development , create an overall effect which is " very exciting , " but the special qualities of the main character Huang Fei-hong become rather blurred .  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
Furthermore , deeper investigation is required into many questions , such as how many shark species are currently commercially fished and exploited , which commercial shark species ' populations are falling because of both shark meat and shark fin consumption and which purely due to demand for shark fins , and which real shark species ' fins are actually referred to by such shark fin market terminology as " white fin , " " black fin , " " Luzon yellow " or " tailhook . "  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
Under the mandate of discouraging nude dance as a form of worship , electronically animated mannequins appeared at one point as substitutes . But though the mannequins ' figures were no less shapely than real performers , and from time to time , they would un veil their gauzy outer garments , fakes , after all , were unable to invoke the same heated response .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
The cans and bottles , with a thin layer of dirt and decayed leaves stuck to the bottom , have been picked up , but few of the onlookers realize yet that the real secret lies in the water inside the container . The two veterans at this game open their backpacks , take out a strainer and a small handled pan , and set to work .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
In keeping with this principle , any enclosed space can be made into a " pinhole camera " by piercing a small hole in it . Rays of light passing through the pinhole cause a vertically and laterally inverted real image of the object in view to fall onto the surface opposite it , as illustrated in the diagram above .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
The Chinese insistence on morality and harmony has certainly destroyed many potential happy marriages . But when , in the face of the setbacks and buffets of real life , people are forced to suppress their emotions , these filter into the deepest parts of life and give rise to a warmth and sincerity which are lasting and inexhaustible-an inward , hidden " classical love . "  
We read the magazine over and over again , as if we were thirsty or starving for the impressive and charming articles . We read everything : each paragraph , each sentence , each character , even each punctuation mark . We pored over and enjoyed the real and inviting photographs , scrupulously examining them , afraid that we would leave out a minor detail , a faint smile .  
Vegetable substitutes for poultry , red meat , and all kinds of seafood can in fact taste even better than the real thing . Chinese have always set great store by selecting holiday foods that symbolize high hopes for the coming year . Thus over time many dishes have acquired auspicious sounding names designed to add to the festive atmosphere .  
In terms of texture , the proportions of protein and fiber can be adjusted to produce different sensations . Thus , chicken is relatively coarse , so the substitute is made with a higher proportion of fiber . Fish is more tender , so the protein content is raised . Add to this that the dishes are processed using the same cooking techniques as for meat-frying in oil , roasting-and the result is that you can hardly tell the veggies from the real things .  
Many people set themselves up as great religious masters , but their actions are quite at odds with their own teachings , " Sogyal Rinpoche says . He says a real master must be of a certain " lineage " through which teachings are transmitted to him . He must have a flawless character , and most importantly , has to be " selfless , " " compassionate " and " wise . " If people observe carefully , they should be able to tell the difference .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
In those days everything was at a high standard of performance . Performers had to undertake formal study with a master for three years and four months . The troupes did not hesitate to spend exorbitant amounts on props , costumes , and new scripts and songs . There were also dynamic scenery and props such as " real rainwater pouring down " and " the bottomless coffin " ( so the " deceased " could get out and suddenly pop up elsewhere ) .  
Today , people are too busy trying to maintain the minimum requirements for their physical existences to have that kind of relaxed , merry perspective on life . I 'm afraid few people indeed are able to address the real world with a " heart of frequent leisure . "  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated . What he likes is to capture human nature , as in the Chinese opera classic The Fourth Son Visiting His Mother , which retains its emotional impact today because the son is torn between family and country , wife and mother .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
Leaving behind the " real virtuality " of Taitien Temple 's heaven , the lush and verdant mortal world around us is vibrant with the sound of cicadas , and a light breeze caresses our skins . The ticket seller dozes peacefully after eating his packed lunch . Is he roaming through heaven in his dreams ?  
Although in the minds of the ancients fairylands were extensions of the real world , the more distant and unattainable they were , the more scope they left for the imagination . The island of Penglai was hazy and indistinct , and the mountains of Kunlun vague and remote .  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
In southern Taiwan , although the election for mayor of Kaohsiung also included an independent candidate , Cheng Te-yao , and an NP candidate , Wu Chien-kuo , the real battle remained that between the DPP 's Frank Hsieh and the KMT 's Wu Den-yih . From the very beginning of the campaign it was thought that Hsieh had little chance of winning , having been involved in the Sung Chi-li cult scandal and facing an incumbent with eight years of experience as mayor . At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .  
Laozi says of the Way : " There was something composed of many things , before heaven and earth were born . " The Way existed before the material world , and seems to move in a never-ending cycle characterized by " departing , becoming distant and returning . " It is an invisible and unceasing motive force within the universe , and the real creator and mover of all visible , physical things .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Hsiao Lin says that as soon as she removed her clothes , her friend Rongrong got all stone-faced , as if given a frightful scare . Previously , in women 's club meetings at school she was always full of righteous opinion on body issues , demonstrating far-left thinking , and prior to the photo shoot they had engaged in quite a bit of discussion and joked around a lot . So it came as a surprise when Rongrong " lost her wits " when it came down to real business .  
Other fields are also booming : With Y2K just around the corner , demand for computer experts is rising . There 's a great demand for marketing personnel in the mobile phone industry . The financial , insurance , and real estate industries are moving toward increasing professionalization and are absorbing and training a large number of new people .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
Her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and Chiung Yao 's series departed too far from reality . This in fact has been a chronic problem of Taiwan 's dramatic serials . " Love succeeded largely because it wedded realism to Taiwanese subject matter .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
The idea of an imaginary miniature world become real is one that seemingly everyone has entertained at one time or another , and it has been represented in art in many ways . China has its bonsai , miniature rock gardens , calligraphy on grains of rice , and jewelry boxes . The West has its eggshell sculpture and model cars . And what could be more representative of miniaturized art than the dollhouses that are so popular in Europe , North America , and Japan ?  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
The desired effect was that of genuine jade , with glass used to make ornaments such as shell-patterned white bi discs , brown cicada stones , and jade-green decorative swords . Such items often used to be mistaken for real jade .  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
Besides encouraging perverse ideas about violence and sex , TV promotes superficiality , crudity and superstition . Things shown in the media often deviate sharply from what children are taught in school or need to know in real life . " It 's really worrying that a lot of nonsense which is meant merely to be for the entertainment of adults becomes accepted as authoritative by minors , " says Joyce Yen Feng .  
They 've got genuine leather furniture , real wood floors , and shelves lined with tens of thousands of manga comics and magazines . Every computer has a 15-inch flat panel display . At the other end of the market , you can go down to Pingtung in southern Taiwan and find very unassuming little Internet cafes with modest decor , barebones equipment , and none of the " all you can eat and drink " signs you 're apt to find in up-market establishments . How many is too many ?  
Apex 's major product at the moment , the alternating pressure pump mattress , is aimed at preventing bedsores , a real nightmare for bedridden patients . Bedsores result from hard mattresses causing parts of the body that bear the most weight ( such as the buttocks and the shoulders ) to be deprived of oxygen and consequently suffer necrosis ( i.e . tissue death ) . This is accompanied by ulceration , suppuration and infestation , from which recovery is very difficult .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
Since the middle of this year , Citibank ( acting through Debenham Tie Leung , a property management firm based in Hong Kong ) has held a series of auctions in Taipei and Kao-hsiung to sell properties from defaulted mortgages at steep discounts . Prices at these auctions have been about 60% of the open market price , sending shock waves through the real estate and financial industries .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
They are equipped not only with radar , wireless communication equipment , and net winches , but everything actually is operable , and even the doors and windows can be opened and closed . His handiwork captures the real thing so well that it 's downright spooky . Even old seadogs gush in praise when they see his boats .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
Trend expert John Naisbitt , in his High Tech , High Touch : Technology and Our Search for Meaning , discusses the threat posed to American youth by violent virtual reality games ( especially lifelike combat games ) , stating that they render children unable to distinguish between real and virtual . This in turn has generated a slew of on-campus firearms attacks that have left American society reeling .  
" A virtual studio is also called a blue-screen studio or green-screen studio , " says Andy Wang , vice president for 3D graphics and virtual reality at Imagetech , the first production company in Taiwan to introduce virtual studio technology . He explains that the spacious virtual studio only has simple props , but the blue background is removed from the image by computer and replaced in real time with scenes prepared in advance using Maya or Max software , so that the combined image can be directly broadcast .  
At the end of June , the Executive Yuan established a special team to outline financial reforms . Invoking existing banking laws , the Ministry of Finance announced a tiered management policy for the credit departments of farmers ' and fishermen 's associations . The goal was to follow up on the August 2001 partial intervention ( in which a special fund was used to take over and restructure 36 of the worst-run ones ) by tackling the widespread problem of unrepaid loans at these credit institutions , to protect farmers ' real interests .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
Before me lay a vast lifeless stretch of yellow , the terrifying Sahara desert that I had read about in geography textbooks when I was a child . Only now it was n't just a name , but was a real place , right under my feet . How could one not feel a rising sense of panic ? !  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously . Only in this way will they truly be able to seize the moment and usher in real political reform and a deepening of the democratic process .  
Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
Society should not only encourage young people to have more diversified dreams , it should let them see behind truly successful people-and especially those who have devoted genuine effort to their dreams and stuck to their guns , or those who have had the courage to change their ways when they discovered that they had mistaken the illusory for the real .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
Of this effective marketing strategy , clinic director Anton Staudinger says with some pride , " Our patients feel reassured as soon as they see that our TCM doctors are real Chinese people . " Dr . Staudinger says with a smile , " We do n't have enough beds to meet demand . We have 80 beds that are occupied all the year round , and prospective patients spend several months on waiting lists to gain admission . "  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
Kuo then set up the artkey company . Using the then-new medium of the Internet as an art gallery , he staged the " SohoArt " Internet art exhibition and a " Top100 artworks " national artwork poll . He also set up a global Chinese arts directory and invited 100 artists to participate in a major exhibit over the Internet , giving artists , who previously had kept a respectful distance from technology , a real opportunity to get on the web .  
For instance , in his freshman year he easily won first prize in a violin competition . But the real reason he moved in the direction of music was probably that he had a crush on a female classmate of his , a girl with long flowing hair who also played violin well . Just to be near her , Lee transferred to the Department of Music , hoping he could win her over .  
Gourds would become a way of life , a creative lynchpin , and the foundation for making the village self-sufficient . Over the years , Kung Yi-fang has used his amazing imagination and selfless attitude to develop and teach his craft , successfully bringing art out of the constrictive world of glass display cases and into the real world . Through Kung 's works , more and more people are coming to appreciate the beauty inherent in even something as simple as a gourd .  
The fires continue to flicker ; the world continues to evolve ; and explorers continue to explore , walking endlessly into the vast unknown and shedding light on the mysterious corners of human nature , like a light searching out the real self .  
These schools provide a support base for the museum , helping to recover personnel and other costs . The museum provides the ideological foundation for the classes , the education being based on the ideas espoused by the gallery and put into practice in the classes . Lin has been running these two organizations for years now in her effort to try and free people 's artistry from the shackles it has been placed in , and to let children be able to sample the emotional qualities inherent in real art .  
With regard to the shocking nature of both the Body Worlds exhibit and the abortion film , all of the above scholars agree that without accompanying documents , lectures , explanations or discussions to allay audience anxieties , simply relying on what is visually apparent will not suffice to reveal the true meaning of life education . Instead , such events may lead to further confusion of public values and errors in understanding . This is where their real concern lies .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
Shihpai , along with neighboring areas eastward to Tienmu and westward to Kuantu , has traditionally been an epicenter of high-value real estate in Taipei . Following the current resurgence , a realty office franchise sandwiched between a bakery and a hardware store next to the Shihpai MRT station witnesses an endless flow of individuals inquiring about real estate daily from the moment the doors open at eight o'clock in the morning till they close at 11 at night .  
That coupled with a surge in new ways to invest money have added up to a diminished interest in real estate as an investment . In other words , the people driving this round of house buying are those purchasing homes for their own use , rather than investors looking for a hedge against inflation or international speculators hoping to make a quick buck . The overall market has been growing steadily .  
Victor Chang sums it up this way : " In the past , Taiwan 's real estate market was ailing , so , just as an ill person takes medicine , a restorative tonic was applied , consisting of preferential home loans , halved land value increment tax , and foreign investment . Close examination should reveal whether the market has improved as a result of the treatment . "  
After gaining the understanding of and establishing mutual trust with his previous employer , Chung went into the same business of contract manufacturing of inverters . However , he was scrupulous in not poaching his previous employer 's customers , even as he expanded his two-person company into a factory employing more than 50 people in just three or four years . He was also occupied by additional investments in more than ten different industries , including real estate , computers , import / export trade , automotive care , and energy-efficient light bulbs .  
The Pan Kung gate is the outermost gate of the temple , but during their occupation of Taiwan the Japanese split the gate from the rest of the temple structure when they built Nanmen Road between them . Since the gate was split from the temple proper , its real purpose has gradually faded from collective memory , so it 's not surprising so few people realize it 's actually part of the temple .  
The area was once central Taiwan 's main aquacultural center , with all kinds of fish being raised there . Traders would come from around the island to strike deals with the local farmers , who did double duty as their own wholesalers . For a while , trade was brisk , but over recent decades the industry has been on the decline , and is now of little real note . Already it seems like people are forgetting this important part of Taiwan 's history .  
A major factor in the rural-urban shift in population is the real or perceived disparities between urban and rural areas in economic opportunities and in social and cultural amenities .  
The collapse of empires has let loose the savage impulse to settle historical scores , redress ancient ethnic grievances , and set right real or imagined injustices over national borders , the treatment of minorities , or the control of resources .  
The representative of FICSA expressed concern at the rapid change in the New York / Washington costofliving differential and hoped that it did not indicate inherent instability in the model chosen , but represented its sensitivity to real external factors .  
Notwithstanding , real GDP registered a negative growth rate of minus 2.8 per cent in 1992 against a planned positive growth rate of 2 per cent as the deterioration in the economic situation was compounded by drought .  
She said that despite numerous laws , which guaranteed women social , political , economic and educational rights , certain traditions and values of a negative nature still affected attitudes towards women and impeded their real participation .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
Neither massive economic assistance , nor a huge international presence can make a real difference if the human rights questions are left unaddressed .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
The so-called underdeveloped world is not calling on the international community for hand-outs or privileged positions in trade ; all it is asking for is fair , transparent and egalitarian treatment , with terms of trade that are not distorted by political pricing , hidden subsidies and dumping practices whose persistence in international trade causes real havoc in the economies of a large number of nations .  
Throughout the gradual transition , the summit meetings of the Central American Presidents have institutionalized the process of regional integration and have given concrete form to the commitments undertaken in Esquipulas II , in which Central America pledged to struggle for peace and eradicate war , to ensure that dialogue prevailed over violence and reason over rancour , to give impetus to real democratic processes , and to promote justice and respect for human rights . 
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
In addition to the great efforts to reform the United Nations system and thus enable the Organization to meet the growing challenges of the future , the practice of transparency by which I mean a daily striving for real contributions to be made to the Council 's decision-making process by all countries concerned is a feasible and practicable course .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s recommended a minimum annual level of $ 30-billion in net official assistance in 1992 if an average annual growth of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent was to be achieved by the year 2000 .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
That effort , which was fully in keeping with many of the objectives agreed at the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development , sought to create real conditions for the overall development of the country on the basis of economic and social stability , guarantee minimum conditions for the development of individuals , families and communities and to carry out international agreements reached at the relevant United Nations conferences .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
It provided a real and immediate opportunity for the Palestinian people and their nascent government authority to elaborate appropriate policies , establish and build credible institutions and implement urgent programmes aimed at guiding the process of structural transformation in the occupied territory during the five-year interim period .  
At the same time , on the domestic front , Turkey is not prepared even to discuss a multi-ethnic and multicultural concept , hence flagrantly and on a large-scale basis violating the human , national and political rights of the Kurds , waging a real internal war against them .  
In reply to concerns raised by the Committee relating to the real force of this provision , the representative stated that , effectively , the Constitution of Peru provided that international treaties concluded by Peru formed part of municipal law , and , accordingly , article 2 , which established that everybody is equal and can not be discriminated against by reason of sex , was part of the law of the land .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
These have been actively considered by UNDP within the broad framework of a strategic management initiative aimed at harmonizing three distinct components of UNDP programming : strategic planning - addressing its basic mission and strategies ; operational planning - focusing on means of achieving results ; and results management - analysing , through monitoring , review and evaluation , real performance against stated plans .  
Undoubtedly the establishment by the Security Council of ad hoc tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda marks a momentous progress in the fight against human rights abuses and fleshes out the basic demand for international justice as a means of contributing to real and lasting peace in countries torn by armed conflict and beset by large-scale disregard of human dignity .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
This latter definition is the real meaning of " intrinsic " as used in these legal instruments , and in any case the words " essential " and " inherent " do not mean that the adverse effects on the environment per se constitute a form of harm which is independent of human beings .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The lack of concrete progress in the political process and , which is even more serious , with regard to the cease-fire , the lack of harmonization in the policies and efforts of all the parties involved and the unfortunate continuation of the flow of arms to the country have now made it necessary to make international support conditional on the existence of real , concrete political will among the parties peacefully to resolve their differences and achieve national reconciliation .  
The real challenge in the area of reforming the social sector is to transcend the current limitations of its organizations , which are isolated , inflexible , overly centralized , hostile to genuine participation , unwilling to address the problems created by power struggles , reluctant to cooperate , of insufficient importance in the State apparatus and lacking in professional career paths for managers and in managers with specialized training in the social sphere .  
The strengthening of the offensive capabilities of the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus , coupled with the completion of extensive fortifications all along the buffer zone , are indicative of the real intentions of Turkey in Cyprus : that is , the imposition of a military solution , something to which Turkey resorts with utter contempt to international law and civilized behaviour .  
In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Although the use of this recourse legally conceals an individual 's real status as a mercenary , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services arranged for and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports may serve as evidence in establishing the true status of persons who are justifiably suspected of engaging in mercenary activities .  
One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
At a time when a real chance for a just and lasting peace , which would satisfy the vital interests of all three peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina is at last within reach , it is essential that this opportunity should not be missed and that all measures be taken so that NATO air strikes which threaten to undermine the entire peace process are immediately stopped .  
Thus , the Special Rapporteur now defines visual pornography as " the visual depiction of a child engaged in explicit sexual activity , real or simulated , or the lewd exhibition of genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material " .  
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .  
However , for real progress to be achieved , my Special Envoy believes that both sides must show concrete signs that they are willing and able to reach and implement a comprehensive settlement , based on three essential elements - the safe and early return of the refugees and internally displaced persons , maintenance of the territorial integrity of Georgia and a special status for Abkhazia .  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .  
He stressed the need to reach a consensus on a fair and equitable apportionment of the expenses of the Organization and reiterated that the real capacity of Member States to pay was the fundamental criterion for determining a scale which would be acceptable to all and would help to strengthen the financial basis of the Organization and of the United Nations system .  
when ratifying a convention , a State declared under the terms of its reservation that it was bound by the instrument only in so far as it was not contrary to domestic legislation , then in real terms it had not accepted any international obligation , and the appearance of its name on the list of signatories was irrelevant .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
It is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum of $ 30-billion in official development assistance was required in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in African countries over the course of the 1990s .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
If the world can focus its energies on ending the testing of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons , we believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves the goal of ending the use of the most simple , cheap and , on a daily basis , most destructive weapon in use today , the anti-personnel landmine .  
We feel that all the working papers submitted and statements made demonstrate the necessity of providing any eventual fourth special session with real and pragmatic content ; otherwise , we will merely be repeating a sterile exercise which , because of its content , would not enjoy consensus among the members of the international community .  
Capital spending has been the main engine of growth in the current cycle , with non-residential fixed investment in 1993-1995 rising at annual average rates of close to 14 per cent in real terms .  
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .  I should now like to turn to the other , technical draft resolution before the Council .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
Among the economic and social factors influencing this process are population growth and voluntary and involuntary migration , real and perceived employment opportunities , cultural expectations , changing consumption and production patterns and serious imbalances and disparities among regions . 
Fourth , disbursements of official development finance ( ODF ) fell : concessional disbursements of official development assistance ( ODA ) rose in both nominal and real terms , but multilateral net lending on non-concessional terms dropped substantially and bilateral net lending on non-concessional terms rose only slightly .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
" Model guns " are toy guns made of metal that have forms similar to genuine handguns and that can be made into real guns .  In this context , " clean controlled delivery " involves secret replacement of an illegal handgun with a legal substitute .  
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
The capacity of African societies and economies for real and sustained growth are being increasingly realized , as most economic policies are now focused on the creation of an enabling environment for the private sector and efficient operation of the market economy .  
The statements made by the Secretary-General to date that no additional mandates can be absorbed have been based upon an assumption that budgeted cost levels and exchange rates will be fulfilled and that the level of real resources ( number of posts , vacancy rates , etc . ) assumed under the $ 2.6-billion appropriation will also evolve as anticipated and that efficiency gains now identified would be applied to achieving the mandated budget reduction of $ 154-million .  
Apart from the general objection to the real or assumed punitive connotation of some of the consequences envisaged in draft article 16 - an objection obviously connected with the general conceptual and terminological issue we set aside [ 4 ] / - a number of specific reservations were expressed .  
It is widely acknowledged in Sarajevo that the joint international effort to keep essential utilities functioning and begin the restoration of the city 's physical infrastructure made a real difference by enabling the citizens of Sarajevo to survive , particularly during winter months , and by giving them hope for the future .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
Article 9.2 : " It is incumbent upon the public authorities to promote conditions which ensure that the freedom and equality of individuals and of the groups to which they belong are real and effective , to remove obstacles which prevent or hinder their full enjoyment , and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political , economic , cultural and social life . "  
It will be seen below that all the autonomous communities have some public body responsible for ensuring that all forms of discrimination are truly eliminated , as well as for taking whatever steps are required to bring about real equality in all areas of public , economic , cultural and social life .  
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
" Deeply concerned about the significant decline in resources allocated to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , the incomplete tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and prospects for the eleventh replenishment at significantly reduced real levels , which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in pursuing collaboration and their role in the field of development ,  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
The Lusaka Protocol , signed on 20 November 1994 , opened real and promising prospects for lasting peace in Angola , and , through agreed arrangements , provides an appropriate framework for the Angolan people to transcend the causes of a particularly devastating and ravaging conflict and to devote themselves finally to the immense task of national reconstruction .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The series fills a real gap on the human-rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
The vast majority of the Russian-speaking population of Latvia , like that of Estonia , was initially deprived of citizenship , and then of the real possibility of obtaining it , and thus is prevented from participating in elections , deprived of the right to purchase land , and subjected to considerable limitations on the rights to privatize and to establish joint stock companies , as well as to occupy posts in the public administration .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at the 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .

Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In conclusion , while emphasizing our consistent and principled positions , we affirm our readiness to coordinate and cooperate with other peace-loving States , as well as with the relevant international organizations , for the realization of a real and genuine peace based on the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments . Sixth .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Only substantive consideration by the Council of the legitimate interests and concerns expressed by Member States during the debates can accurately guide the Council in its work and provide it with the necessary and impartial information that will enable it to assess the real causes of conflicts , counteract their consequences and take action to find just and lasting solutions , free from politically motivated prejudices and not dominated by the illegitimate interests of just one country or a small group of countries .  
Likewise , for democracy to have real meaning for it to be an ideal shared by all peoples and for it to fully achieve its liberating and saving effects it must be unambiguously expressed both at the national and the international levels .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
They needed to be applied impartially , on the basis of specific criteria and a clear timetable , and only when there was a real threat to international peace and security .  The possibility of adopting smart sanctions , which would not affect innocent civilians or cause undue suffering , had been discussed .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
The mission focused on balancing real radiological risks against economic , social and psychological problems , and generating together with the authorities of the concerned countries realistic projects with a high likelihood of success , leading to measurable improvements in the current conditions under which the population was living .  
These national services , working collaboratively in real time , provide the unique operational capabilities of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) , a coordinated international system of national meteorological and hydrological services that is based on the common acceptance of protocols and standard terminology .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
The international community has come to realize that only an integrated and holistic response to the issue of landmine contamination , and its multifaceted humanitarian and socio-economic consequences , is capable of bringing real and lasting benefits to those who are considered at risk from those weapons .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 , 1994 and , more recently , in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
I wish to reiterate that , while we fully support the noble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines , a sweeping ban can not be a satisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of Korea , which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence of all-out war , and whose heavily populated capital is only 25 miles from the military demarcation line .  
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
The ministerial meeting of the Security Council devoted to Africa , held on the commendable initiative of the United States last 25 September , led to a fruitful exchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of the international community to become more actively , more significantly and more concretely involved in a new type of partnership with Africa in order to contribute to its development .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
The cold war had just ended , and barriers both real and perceived were falling , paving the way for precisely this type of treaty negotiated on a multilateral basis , as opposed to the bipolar accords with which the world was more familiar .  
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
It was stressed that the very high real interest rates in transitional economies such as Kazakstan were characteristic of a transitional period of macro adjustment and reflected high levels of uncertainty and perceived risks to lenders ; such rates did not represent equilibrium conditions and far exceeded the possibilities for most enterprises to generate sufficient real income . 
If an Annex A or Annex B Party achieves real reductions in net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases which are greater than that determined by its commitments , this difference ( in terms of the sum of annual reductions of tonnes of carbon equivalent ) is registered as a contribution to the fulfillment of that Party 's commitments for the next period .  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,

Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .

In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
She was disappointed and alarmed at the continuing real decline in official development assistance over the past four years and the overwhelming concentration of foreign direct investment in only a handful of countries .  
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
The right to development , which was a basic right , was essential for promoting and protecting economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , since poverty was a real obstacle to the effective enjoyment of those rights . 
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
In order for countries to have a real chance to eradicate poverty , they must achieve sustained economic growth , accompanied by increased public expenditure in the social sector , which could take place only in an expanding national economy .  
The complex issues raised by migration should be addressed in a constructive manner in order to build a future of tolerance and mutual understanding and to dispel the very real fears associated with the phenomenon .  
The scale should remain predictable and stable and should continue to be based on real capacity to pay , as determined according to transparent procedures and adequate information on the economic situation of Member States .  
Lastly , it was reported that , in recent years , paramilitary organizations had increasingly practised selective disappearance of civic leaders perceived as real or potential guerrilla supporters .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
Meanwhile , we must let the rest of the world understand the real nature of this conflict - that this is not just another internal conflict in some small and distant developing country , but an armed rebellion , externally inspired and maintained , against the people of Sierra Leone and their democratically elected Government .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
Child pornography means the conception , production , presentation , dissemination , whether or not on commercial basis , visual or audio , that constitute a real or simulated representation of a child engaged or depicted as engaged in sexual activity or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child for promoting or satisfying sexual purposes .

The economic recovery programme and economic policy measures laid the foundation for accelerated privatization in FRY , opening up of the economy and other measures aimed at increased productivity , starting with improved conditions of business operations and the creation of real possibilities for enterprises to rid themselves of redundant workers , as well as at resolving employment issues and providing for the subsistence of these workers outside enterprises . 
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Firstly , international cooperation in the collection , collation and interpretation of observations of near-Earth objects is essential for early assessment of the tiny , but real risk of a potentially devastating impact in the foreseeable future and to refine the precise computations needed for any mitigation measures in case a significant danger of an impact were to be substantiated .  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
During 1995-1999 , stock markets in the United States , as measured by the performance of the Standard and Poors 500 index ( the S &amp; amp ; P 500 ) deflated by the consumer price index ( CPI ) , registered an average annual real return of 24 per cent , double the average over the last century .  
The booming stock markets have been closely interrelated with rapid ICT innovations and the strong performance of the real economy , yielding a virtuous circle .  
The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
Furthermore , this motivation ( in the direct interest of the non-indigenous party ) was quite clear : to legitimize ( via the acquiescence of the autochthonous sovereign of the territories in question ) any right ( real or intended ) with which they could counter opposing claims advanced by other colonial powers vying for control of those lands .  
immediate restitution of all illegally and forcibly taken real estate to its rightful private and State owners , and reinstatement of those employed in the private and public sectors who were dismissed from their jobs because of the tacit and tolerant attitude of UNMIK and KFOR ;

In order to build a firm foundation for real and enduring peace and security , it was essential to eliminate the root causes of conflict , be they of a political , ethnic , economic , social or other nature .  
His delegation felt that the approach based on zero real or nominal growth ceilings was artificial and should be abandoned in favour of a new method which would primarily take account of programmes defined by common consent , the Secretariats role being to evaluate the resources required for their implementation .  
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
During this time of increased calls for international resources for Kosovo and other parts of the world , when donor fatigue for Bosnia and Herzegovina is very real , the continued unwillingness of substantial parts of the local leadership to create conditions conducive to returns and to the integral implementation of the Dayton peace agreement can not be tolerated . 
While we recognize the difficulty of achieving smart sanctions in the real world , we also believe that there is a continuing need to minimize collateral , unintended humanitarian suffering through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and mechanisms for periodic substantive reviews .  
While we recognize the difficulty in the real world of achieving smart sanctions , we believe that there is a recurring need to minimize the collateral though unintended human suffering , through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and periodic review mechanisms .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives , recognized as legal entities , are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises , and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement .  
In the modern world , the development of national scientific and technological capacities was essential for increasing the competitiveness of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition and ensuring their real integration into the world economic system .  
The question of nationality was further complicated when , as a result of a succession of States , two or more legal systems collided or overlapped , and ostensibly logical and transparent criteria of nationality proved to be obscure and elusive when applied in real circumstances . 
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
If world commodity markets are left to the &amp; lt ; free play of market forces = , while much high-cost agriculture in developed countries - - even after the Uruguay Round - - continues to be subsidized , the underlying problem of the downward trend in real prices of commodities exported by developing countries is likely to persist .  
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
It not only affected those who were subject to its direct indiscriminate attacks , but it posed a real threat to international peace and security , and endangered the political process in the international arena , including the peace process in the Middle East .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
If we do not rapidly take effective measures to correct the negative effects of that process , the threats of social disintegration will become increasingly real and disturbing , and the possibility of establishing stability and lasting peace even more remote .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .  
We are hopeful that the effective implementation of this decision will go a long way in supporting national efforts to reduce the debt burden of these countries to more serviceable levels and open for them the opportunities for real and sustained economic growth .  
The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance . 
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
Here , too , it is apparent that without a more favourable international environment , without significant financial input , without real alleviation , if not outright cancellation , of the debt and without a sustained and lasting rate of growth , the laudable and courageous efforts and the sacrifices made so far by the African countries will prove insufficient , if not useless , in the face of the great needs of the African peoples .  
We have also drafted complementary projects , such as the national system for the selection of beneficiaries , aimed at providing flexible , transparent and decentralized assistance to the neediest families and households , and the system to follow up and assess policies and social programmes designed to evaluate on an ongoing basis the efficiency and real effectiveness of policies and public spending on social programmes .  
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
In order to bring about real improvements in the human rights situation in the whole region , it was necessary to adopt a positive strategy aimed at gradually opening up all those societies , rather than resorting to partial measures or economic sanctions resulting in the weakening of the forces of democracy and the emerging civil society , which provided the only guarantees for the promotion and respect of human rights .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes requires the deployment of substantial resources that exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Inter-area price information at both the national and international levels is essential to a proper understanding and analysis of real economic differences in a spatial context .  
Considering the size and nature of the Missions real estate , which includes 166 observation posts and 14 primary United Nations camps locations including accommodations , offices and other premises , and in line with the recommendation of the internal auditors , it is important that a civil engineer be assigned to oversee the planning , repair and renovation of the premises in order to ensure the most economic , efficient and effective utilization of resources .  
Since , in Chile , credit approval depends on the applicants solvency and ability to offer sufficient collateral , with real property being preferred to personal property , married women under the joint ownership regime face legal obstacles .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Participants affirmed that national sovereignty should not be exercised at the expense of respect for human rights , and that real efforts towards the co-development of countries north and south of the Mediterranean , as well as the strengthening of the rule of law , would contribute to reducing erratic migratory flows and facilitate economic cooperation , mutual understanding and cultural exchanges .  
With the understanding and support of the international community and motivated by the desire to find real , definitive and peaceful solutions to disputes , we successfully moved forward and created peace and tangible progress for our peoples .  
Mr . Sareva ( Finland ) , speaking on behalf of the European Union , the associated countries Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Malta , Romania and Slovenia and , in addition , Iceland , said that it was necessary to devise a more equitable , stable , simple and transparent scale of assessments based on reliable , verifiable and comparable data and reflecting each Member States real capacity to pay .  
While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
The basis for the Security Council 's action is , above all , the recognition that flagrant , grave and systematic violations of universally accepted international humanitarian and human rights law may pose a real threat to international peace and security .  
Such economic , social and development policy measures have proven taxing on the national budget of an economy burdened with reconstruction , low investment and real growth rates and high unemployment , as is always the case in a postconflict society .  
She also interpreted any representation , by whatever means , of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities not to be applicable to adults acting , posing or dressing as a child .  
The United States understood the definition to include the visual representation of a child , engaged in real or simulated sexual activities , or of the genitalia of a child where the dominant characteristic was depiction for a sexual purpose .  
As we look ahead , we can see real risks that resource depletion , especially freshwater scarcities , as well as severe forms of environmental degradation , may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways .  
It was noteworthy that the total resource level proposed for the section represented hardly any increase compared with the current appropriation in real terms but involved a considerable increase after recosting .  
In this regard , the collective Presidency is required to ensure the full implementation of the Accords , showing real political will at the domestic level while seeking complementary solutions at the regional level .  
If the forces of globalization are allowed to operate freely overlooking the central premise of humancentred development the spectre of massive levels of human rights violations resulting in grave social and political upheavals is a real one .  
He said India , which had over a-billion inhabitants and constituted a real ethnic , linguistic and religious patchwork , had chosen an economic , social and political model which was unique for a former colony with development problems .  
Unfortunately , the peacekeeping resources of the Organization are not limitless , and they must be apportioned in the best possible way , in a manner commensurate with the real danger posed by a given conflict to regional and global stability .  
Sixthly , the creation and entrenchment of robust legal structures which adequately defend the rights of civilians and act as a real deterrent to potential violators of international human rights law remains a vital component in a global approach to the protection of civilians .  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
But as long as the international community continues to pursue a piecemeal approach to the Balkans , in which loose coordination among a multitude of actors is an unsatisfactory substitute for purposeful planning , the real opportunities to close a tragic decade of war and instability will go begging .  
In this respect , the presence of political leaders who are prepared to handle social complaints and demands by violent means with a view to satisfying selfish political and economic ambitions is the real cause of , and an inevitable catalyst of , social violence and armed conflicts .  
For all genuine regional and international efforts to succeed in Somalia , it becomes necessary that all actors reach a common , objective and unbiased vision about the real tasks ahead .  
However , we strongly believe that the dynamic of the entire peace process can be maintained and moved forward only if the responsibilities and the political will of the parties is fulfilled and translated into real action .  
The long series of armed conflicts in Africa inevitably involving mercenaries organized in various ways offers harsh and brutal proof of the fact that the real and effective exercise of the right of many African peoples to self-determination has not been realized .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
Urge the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
In designing the orientation of its future work on globalization , ACC recognized the crucial role that the system , collectively , should play to build the knowledge and evidence base required to help develop effective , integrated responses capable of positively influencing globalization processes and their social impact , and of bringing real benefits to the poor .  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
Urges the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
The ruling is a positive sign , in that it was objective and made a point of stating that the investigation of the facts must continue , but at the same time it demonstrated the impunity surrounding such acts , in that the authorities responsible for the investigation were unable to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute the real culprits .  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
In terms of its real meaning , it bespoke a balance of terror , a cold-war calculation that the physical security and ultimate fate of hundreds of millions of human beings had to be held hostage to the prospect of instant annihilation .  
The unprecedented development of corporate , State and international information systems and the simultaneous expansion of opportunities of access to them have attained such a level that today practically every member of the international community will be exposed to a real risk of electronic attack by criminals or terrorists .  
In real terms , that represented a negative growth of 3 per cent per annum , as the Agency faced an annual growth of 3.5 per cent in its clientele population driving a similar growth in staff and financial requirements , and an annual weighted average rate of inflation in the UNRWA area of operations at 4 per cent .

At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .  Immediately the launchers will be asked to launch a missile .  This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
The course of cross-strait relations in the last five years proves again that it will be only by acting in line with the " one China , two countries " principle , holding cross-strait political talks , to end the hostile cross-strait state as soon as possible , that will really end over a century of Chinese humiliation and territorial division by the great powers , and really achieve China 's complete reunification and a real renaissance of the Chinese nation , to achieve the longstanding dream of the Chinese people to become a strong country .  
Public security Minister Jia Chunwang pointed out at a news briefing held today : The public security organs at all levels must adhere to the guiding principle of taking the initiative to grasp problems in real earnest and on an earlier date and should firmly keep the initiative in work .  Grasping problems in real earnest does not mean staging a show for the leaders and masses .  Rather , it means daring to crack hard nuts in real earnest ;  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
Though a myriad of contradictions have yet to be tackled and countless difficulties yet to be overcome in the historical process of national rejuvenation through science and education , so long as we forge ahead in face of difficulties and implement the party 's relevant policies in real earnest , our national rejuvenation through science and education is bound to dutifully accomplish its mission by creating new brilliance in the course of the Chinese nation 's great rejuvenation .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
They must solidly solve well various urgent problems which affect the people 's lives and are important to the general situation of reform , development and stability .  We must resolutely prevent and overcome bureaucratic working styles such as being detached from the masses and taking advantage of official posts .  We must resolutely prevent and overcome formalist working styles such as pursuing undeserved reputations and paying no attention to real results .  
It seems that the United States is only accustomed to a relationship in which it gives the orders and other countries obey , and is not yet accustomed to living on equal terms with other countries ; it is only accustomed to living in an impossible uniform world regulated by itself , and is not yet accustomed to living in the real pluralistic world .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
If our military 's writers and artists can achieve these , they can obtain the rich source material contained in various new and typical aspects of society , reflect the real spirit of the times accurately and in a lively manner , and create highly concise , perfect and successful works with clear characteristics of the times .  
When the training entered the stage of camouflage concentration target confrontation , offices and soldiers of the " red army " set up concentration targets , such as real and false artillery positions , missile positions , and field airports using camouflage to make true targets invisible while leaving false targets exposed , such as shaped defilade , smoke screen , and false target .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
Third , to verify the situation of personnel structure and personnel change of the central budget units , and understand in detail the manning quota of the budget units , the actual number and structure of the staff , and the situation of actual average expenditure per person for every outlay in order to provide basic numbers for determining the standard of a fixed number of staff and fixed quotas which meet the real situation .  
Being showy and not substantial , some people made false reports , exaggerated , practiced formalism , sought superficial grandeur , and paid no attention to real results .  Instead of accomplishing something , they only managed to deal with the higher levels ' inspections and assessments .  Although they accomplished nothing , their reports were closely reasoned and well argued .  
Non-governmental economic cooperation has evolved from individual corporate ones to the stage of establishing " special economic zones " and industrial parks .  Increasing economic and trade cooperation and personnel exchanges have helped increase mutual understanding and trust , which not only bring real benefits for the people of the two Koreas but produce a positive impact on the improvement of the north-south relationship .  
The supervision and control of the leading cadres is a regular , arduous task that requires the relentless efforts of the party organizations at all levels , but it is also a real and urgent task that requires the party organizations to make very sure that the supervision and control measures are implemented in accordance with their supervisory and control duties .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Second , reform has led to the monetization of economy and the deepening of finance , the former distribution in kind was gradually changed to distribution in money at real market prices ( the recent reform to suspend welfare housing distribution is an example ) , and the simple and unitary financial product previously provided by commercial banks has become complex and diversified .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .  Before engaging in real fire exercises the troops are already prepared with a fair amount of practice in operational skills , even using simulation to train for weapons systems that have yet to become operational .  
In order to accelerate the steps towards making a leap in training , we should extract from past " exhibitions " and " briefings " on real technology based on existing computer networks to train the troops , and rely on all training bases ' extensive opening up of simulated training to enable the troops to become familiar with and master information technology and equipment as soon as possible .  At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
For example , some people have laid stress on their professional work while making light of theory .  According to these people , theory is soft and nominal , and it makes no difference how much theoretical knowledge one will master ; whereas professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology is solid and real , and one 's knowledge in this aspect can be measured easily .  
For instance , after the Central Military Commission decided the military troops " should not be involved in doing business " but " live on royal food " , the military cut down the real estate scale and stopped its real estate business .  In this situation , how should the military implement an effective administration and prevent its assets from flowing away ?  
People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
Nevertheless , the commanders delivered quick judgments on and decisively handled all kinds of situations , ensured that the group army campaign succeeded in its attempts , concealed the real things and displayed bogus ones , launched three-dimensional attacks , and struck in depth and breath .  The " red army " finally surrounded and annihilated the " enemy " positional defense after two days and nights of tough contests .  
On site , the writer saw a series of situations being sent to the directorial center in real time and promptly .  They included whether the commanders could rapidly and accurately make judgments on enemy situations , whether they could make scientific decisions , whether instructions could be sent to affiliated combat troops amid electronic interference , whether troops could trust deep into the enemy force and take up position as scheduled and according to instructions , and whether information on the enemy could be handled effectively .  
Education must be based on real wars .  Teachers of the college meticulously design curriculums close to reality , train and mold students through such curricular activities as the " blue Classroom " , " social Classroom " , " international Classroom " and " classroom of War Simulations " .  And they have transformed high-tech knowledge into combat abilities in their students .  
It only showed that the strike distance of a weapon was greatly extended .  The real integration of information with firepower is embodied in the guided weapons .  They include the earliest guided missiles of passive target-detection such as that of infrared target detection guidance and electromagnetic wave guidance , and the various precision guided weapons of the present .  
All levels should regard improving leadership styles and doing well the positive three Stresses education as the concrete embodiment of carrying out the requirements of the " Three Representations " , as a real action of focusing on grassroots units and laying solid foundations , and as an important indicator of reinforcing and developing the achievements of the " Three Stresses " education held for Party committees at levels higher than the regiment .  
" It is difficult to draw a human being but it is easy to draw a ghost " .  This is how the Chinese describe tricks aimed at deceiving people with fabricated stories , meaning that it is difficult to deceive people with what is real or can be seen but easy to lead people astray with what is absurd or preposterous .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
They aim for the target of accomplishing combat task requirements without going through real battle training and without replenishing personnel and equipment .  Through reform of flight training , this unit has realized new breakthroughs in combat strength in the following five areas .  In the area of basic flight skill training , flying has been evolved from normal conditions to flying under bad weather conditions or under other extreme conditions .  
Applying all kinds of advanced simulation equipment and methods ; simulating an almost real combat situation ; putting trainees onto a lively , specific , complex and changing modernized battlefield ; creating a rich battlefield environment ; and allowing the trainees to train in technology , tactics , strategy , and command in a near-real combat situation ; this is the necessary trend for military training development in all nations of the world , and is also the resting place for China 's science and technology to train the troops .  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
Looking at the changes in market prices , the main impact came from the big rise in international oil prices and domestic policy-style price adjustments , and the real impact from being drawn forward by expanded market demand was still rather weak .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .  
Building up the foundation and devoting effort to implementation are a process of endless circles and spiral ascent , which require repeated effort and effort at repetition .  However , this repetition is not simply a mechanical repetition on a low level ; instead , it requires that we should - - along with the deepening of reform , development of the situation , and the real situation of the units - - continuously adapt ourselves to new issues , study new problems and resolve new contradictions .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
They said that China had for a long time provided unconditional economic assistance to the African continent , and even though China is not Africa 's major creditor , this action taken by China as a developing country is indicative of its sincere hope to join Africa in realizing the common development aspiration within the framework of South-South cooperation .  Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
To build on progress and create greater glories , we must consider the constant improvement of the people 's standard of living to be the fundamental starting point for all of our work .  While we continue to take care of everyday affairs for the people year after year , we must join together to make some major accomplishments that all of the people of Beijing can see and feel , and that will bring even more real benefits to the people in the city and in outlying areas .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
It is understood that the development of this large piece of training equipment , which can conduct total-system simulation of real equipment , was tackled as an assault mission and completed in three months by a " shock brigade " made up of 29 experts at the college .  It was over seven times more efficient than conventional development , providing strong technical support for the fast generation of combat capability from new equipment .  
To ensure that research work could be fulfilled on time , the brigade held a forum with local government and captains of some fishing boats to exchange views in a bid to improve the research findings .  They also formulated plans for a real army-civilian joint mine-sweeping drill , organized and completed a map inference for joint mine-sweeping operations .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
The list of US arms sales to Taiwan has been generally decided .  Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held that safeguarding national security is the consistent stand of the ruling and opposition parties .  He also stressed that Taiwan must not pay attention to the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war . "  He said that obtaining weapons does not necessarily mean ensuring national defense security , and national defense security alone is not equivalent to national security and that real national security must have political support , which means stable cross-strait relations .  
Recently , while the US stock market was falling again and again , Taiwan 's stock market did not follow suit and even slightly rose .  The key for this lay in the existence of the mainland conceptual stocks formed by the Taiwan businessmen 's investment in the mainland , the opening of B shares on the mainland stock market , and the booming real estate market on the mainland side .  All these factors effectively played a role in supporting Taiwan 's stock market .  
The wireless digital tactical graphic terminal developed by the regiment through cooperation with a certain research institution can transmit real time pictures from the forward position and the front line ; it can also transmit quality still pictures .  As a result , the task of reconnaissance , monitoring , tracking , and information collection can be conducted in a more timely and convenient manner .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .  Whenever conditions allow , we should stage training exercises involving students from various military academies and schools , commanding officers from various units , and command organs from the units set to play a key role in such exercises , thus enabling all personnel concerned to handle the same situation together , and the general departments should organize and send personnel to examine and appraise training results .  
Since its independence , India has already established an intelligence organization which is fully equipped and functional .  On the surface , it does not seem to be as famous as the CIA of the United States , KGB of the Soviet Union , MI5 of Britain , and Mossad of Israel but just as confidential as the intelligence work should be , Indian is quietly and secretly doing its intelligence work and achieving real results which are not necessarily a bit less outstanding than others .  
In mid May , officers from the northwestern operation department under the General Staff Headquarters and the military command academy and specialists in military science jointly organized an operation drill to oppose pro-Taiwan independence forces ' attempt to liberate Taiwan and as an effort to put down their rebellions .  This operation drill was launched with high technology at a simulated battlefield , set up based on the ratio of a real war battlefield .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It is true that the party , before long after its establishment , realized that , in light of the Chinese real situation of a semicolonial and semi-feudalistic society , the party should give priority to toppling imperialist and feudalistic forces over the immediate establishment of a socialist society not to mention a communist society , a task for far ahead in the future .  
and four Armed Forces Awards for Scientific and Technological Advancement , Third Class . Tao Qian , an officer with a doctorate degree in science of military campaigns , recently demonstrated his ability in the base that the military region built for combined campaign training exercises .  His remarkable performance in teaching the theory of organized campaigns and directing a real exercise has made him the pacesetter of the military region in providing the armed forces with science and technology training .  
The development and change of the post-Cold War international security situation shows that apart from cooperative security mechanism , the other mechanisms have not played or will also impossibly play , in the real terms , the role as patron saint in regional security , because the security based on those mechanisms is built on the basis of the others ' insecurity and is the refurbished version of the historical old security mechanism with hegemonist coloration .  
We should create a warm , joyful , united , inspiring atmosphere around the main theme , and should organize various activities with the spirit of innovation by improving the work style , stressing real results , preventing waste and extravagance , and opposing formalism . 
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
Party organizations at all levels are urged to push forward the building of grassroots party organizations with an innovative mind , integrate in real terms the work of party building at the grassroots level with the reality of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , take earnest steps to enhance the effectiveness of their work , and give better play to the role of grassroots party organizations as a strong fighting force ;  
do a good job of the logistic work in the preparations for military struggle and of logistic reform and innovation with high demands and the spirit of the speech as the base , by centering on the party 's objective of endeavor and historical mission in the new century , and in line with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission , and realize adequate logistic support in real terms ;  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Our workers in the field of philosophy and social science should follow Secretary Jiang 's demands and " take our direction from Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , planting our feet on the real achievements of constructing a Chinese-style socialism , setting our eyes on the progress of development of world social science and culture , and constantly developing healthy , upward striving , rich and colorful socialism with Chinese style and special Chinese characteristics . "  
The appointment of certain a retired lieutenant colonel of the national armed forces by the name of Liu to be a regimental commander with the rank of colonel in the Nanjing Military Region is the first case in which the Chinese communists have appointed a turncoat of Taiwan 's national armed forces as field commanding officer with real power .  
It has been learned that the new newspaper to be published next month is a quarto color daily with 32 pages each day .  The authorities have promised that as long as the " orientation " is correct , the newspaper can make independent decisions on the policy for publishing reports , the scope for gathering news , and the arrangement for different columns .  The newspaper can also be operated entirely according to market requirements and is expected to be the real metropolitan newspaper of Shenzhen .  
Governments at all levels should have the resolve and should take strong measures against the illegal activities of manufacturing and selling counterfeit and shoddy goods , outlaw all places used for manufacturing and selling counterfeit goods , smash narrow-minded local protectionism and regional economic blockade , smash the monopoly of industries and trades , establish unified national markets , encourage enterprises to compete by fair means , and give shape to a market competition mechanism in real terms by which only the best will survive .  
We should try to find out the real situation , analyze current developments , pay close attention to both the key areas and the weak links of our work , lay stress on the work at the township and town level , and work out measures to ensure a sound fulfillment of responsibilities .  
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
The theoretical study central group of the party group of the organs of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative studied once again Jiang Zemin 's " 1 July " important speech in a concentrated and thoroughgoing way in close connection with the realities in the CPPCC organs and implemented the spirit of the speech in real earnest .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
They should establish their footing on the current situation of the country , advance with the time , break new grounds , pay attention primarily to studying the important issues in real life , draw the rich resources and strong power for their theoretical innovation from reforms , opening up and modernization drive , closely follow the trend of world development , and profoundly understand the laws for contemporary China 's economic and social development .  
We have also asserted that China and Japan are close neighbors separated by only a strip of water , the two countries used to have friendly exchanges in history , and we have the wish to live on friendly terms with the Japanese people for generations to come .  However , when saying this , we must never forget an indispensable precondition , that is , the Japanese in our time must give up in real terms the policy of militarism which was pursued by their sinful forefathers .  
give ever wider publicity to and strengthen theoretical research in comprehensive management of public security , gradually establish and perfect a spending support mechanism , vigorously strengthen the building of the contingent of workers engaged in comprehensive management of public security , improve work styles in real earnest , and make sure that the various measures for comprehensive management of public security are implemented down to village ( residential ) households and individuals .  
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
Indeed , the regiment 's " red unit " and " blue unit " managed to refine each other 's tactics step by step during each round of fighting , by exposing each other 's loopholes , refining each other 's tactics , improving each other 's training plans , developing new tactics , and conducting training in light of a real war .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
ensured the development of two major industries , such as agriculture and animal husbandry and the telecommunications industry ; downsized such industries as retail marketing , international trade , real estate , petrochemical , auto , and motor vehicle manufacturing industries ; and supported the development of major industries by selling stock rights and recovering parts of the investment .

They neither reach deep into the reality nor go deep among the masses .  Refraining from making investigations and studies and without a clear understanding of the real situation , they act on their own personal feeling and subjective will .  What they are seeking is their own promotion .  They deceive their superiors and delude their subordinates and make false work performance .  And they do not hesitate to waste manpower and public funds .  As for the people 's well-being and demands , they are indifferent and insensitive .  
The secondary industry which is heavily based on high-tech and advanced sciences provides the real strength behind the tertiary industry 's development , and in turn the tertiary industry 's development provides the vast space and the technological and information services that allow the secondary industry to gear its operating funds to the market , and it also absorbs millions of the secondary industry 's surplus labor force , producing the effect of the secondary and tertiary industries promoting each other 's development .  
Measures should be taken to ensure that the salaries of staff and workers in the administrative units and public institutions are paid in full and on time , resolve the problem of salaries in arrears that exists in the units at county and township levels in real earnest , and further do a good job of the unified payment of salaries and financial expenses in the party and government organs and educational departments .

From their practice of changing Jilin'sbackward look , the city party committee and the city government of Jilin have learned that to bring the spiritual civilization building into factories , mines , and communities in real terms , what counts is to introduce a new practice of activating the ideological-political work from bottom to top instead of the other way round , and to move the foothold of the work from the previous practice of holding oneself responsible for higher authorities to a new practice of holding oneself responsible for lower levels .  
ensure meticulous organization ; and firmly grasp in real earnest this as a major issue bearing on overall interests of reform , development , and stability in such a spirit as holding ourselves highly responsible to the people and history .

Beijing is strong in the fields of science and technology , personnel , intelligence and information , which form a solid foundation for the development of the high-tech industry .

Yet for the community , social and personal services sector and the transport , storage and communications sector , nominal increases of 0.1% and 1.5% were recorded respectively .  
With ocean cargo flows to the United States returning to normal by now , and even allowing for some downside in the export performance for the remaining two months of the year , the forecast growth rate in real terms of total exports of goods in 2002 is still lifted , to 7.1% in the current update , from 5.4% as put out earlier .  
Within the total exports of goods , the forecast increase in real terms in re-exports is raised to 9% from 7% , but the forecast decline in real terms in domestic exports is lowered to 9% from 8% , with the latter adjustment reflecting an accentuated structural shift away from domestic exports to re-exports and offshore trade . 
Overall investment spending in the economy , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is now expected to decline by 4.1% in real terms in 2002 , up from the earlier forecast of a 4.8% fall .  
This was made possible by using advanced videoconferencing technology through the connection of high-speed broadband network using Internet2 technology , which supports reliable and high quality real time multi-parties interactive communication among different networks at different geographical locations which are vastly separated . 
This round of the survey covers about 67 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the construction sector , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .

Sub-sectors with moderate increases were the real estate ( up by 8.2% ) and the business services ( 5.1% ) .  On the other hand , employment in all the other selected major sectors decreased .  In particular , the number of manual workers at construction sites showed the largest decline , by 13.3% .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
This round of the survey covers about 52 000 establishments which are drawn from various sectors including the industrial sector ( mining and quarrying ; manufacturing ; electricity and gas ) , the distributive trades sector ( wholesale , retail and import / export trades , restaurants and hotels ) and the services sector ( transport , storage and communications ; financing , insurance , real estate and business services ; community , social and personal services ) .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , fell back by 5.3% in real terms in the second quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , following a 3.5% rise in the first quarter . 
The forecast rate of change in real terms in overall investment spending in the economy in 2003 , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is broadly unchanged at - 5.4% , as against - 5.5% put out earlier .

In the U . S . , the three main TV networks have similar programs , such as " Issues &amp; Answers " on ABC , " Meet the Press " on NBC , and " Face the Nation " On CBS . Government officials in the Republic of China have often appeared on TV , but in most cases they made speeches in a stiff , official manner and confined themselves to formal announcements and outlines rather than giving " inside information " of real interest to the public .  
The tao tsang or canons ( accepted texts ) of all Taoist scriptures were divided into three tungs . The root meaning of the word tung is cave , but it also means " to communicate , to understand the mysteries . " The term thus evokes the mysterious mountain grottoes , real or imaginary , harboring hidden revelations and dealings with the sacred powers .  
The sky above and ocean below framed a picturesque scene , the sails arching almost to their tearing point , the array of gaily painted boats , and the muscles of well-built , powerful sailors responding to the pounding of the waves against their sailboats . The champion of this event , an American air-force pilot named Jack who sails in his spare time , described man 's battle on the aquatic battlefield : " This was real sailing !  
Lee survived her college years because she learned early when and to whom it would be safe to speak from her heart , when to conceal her true thoughts , and how to avoid beatings or the excruciating pain of being brainwashed . " I was always nervous , " she says , " not knowing when the Red Guards would find out my real feelings .  
On February 15 , President Chiang Ching-kuo was nominated for re-election as president of the Republic of China . In accepting the unanimous decision of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang , Chiang said he was a " willing soldier ready to go back to the battlefield with a fighting spirit . " Although the choice came as no real surprise , it confirmed the wide support and popularity he has among the entire population .  
Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair . Many companies feel they are the victims says one official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , but the real damage is done to the country as a whole . The goal of economic upgrading and technological progress will be thwarted if this belief persists .  
During the shooting of the film Dr . Ngor , still with vivid pictures in his mind about his ordeal , often expressed his displeasure to the producer and director that the film was n't explicit enough in showing the true terror of what went on . Although many of his suggestions were incorporated into the film , many were not because the producer felt it would be too brutal , too real to be accepted as the truth .  
Although Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio does not lack for beautiful ghosts , in popular legend their beauty is just a disguise ; their real features are hideous and terrible , an impression confirmed in the common expression " as ugly as a ghost . "  
He did n't have enough cash on him so he asked to have one held and to pay for it after he finished his show and got his money . " No wonder they are fascinated . Each bonsai is a miniature world all its own , rich in human interest , that can set the spirit soaring to a place where , poised between the real and the imaginary , we wander among the hills and valleys of our dreams . (  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
The free , impressionistic side of Chinese painting is reflected in the way Peking opera simplifies and abstracts , mixing the real and the unreal to create a unique aesthetic synthesis . And Chinese painting 's meticulous brushwork is mirrored in Peking opera by the extreme concentration paid to every gesture and intonation . "  
One of the real contributions of this congress was to establish a process for the input of public opinion through the nominating system for the Central Committee , for which half the nominees were selected by the chairman and half by petition among the delegates . The vote was by secret ballot of all the delegates , increasing the supervisory role of the base level vis-a-vis the center while making the latter more sensitive to the former .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
What 's awful are the bombs through the telephone , the salvo of alarming rings expanding the battleground from the mailbox outside the door to the soft underbelly of the study , the silent movie changed to sensur-round sound , the imaginary enemy shooting with real bullets .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
Remarkably , retailers are falling over themselves to cut prices for items such as compact discs , furniture , home appliances , automobiles and antiques , none of which are subject to seasonal fluctuations . And prices for gold , real estate and land , normally much sought after as a hedge against inflation , have not only failed to rise rapidly , some are actually falling at an astonishing rate .  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
" The real issue is whether agency heads have the determination and guts to exercise their assessment responsibilities , " points out Hsu Yu-fu . The basic status of civil servants is guaranteed by law and they can not be cashiered lightly ; meanwhile those dismissed with a " D " grading will lose their pension entitlement , so departmental heads shrink from drastic action from sympathetic considerations and to avoid a backlash , which , means there is no effective way of weeding out unsuitable personnel . "  
" The age of the solo aerial combat hero is over , the tendency in the modern air force is towards group tactics requiring a high level of coordination between friendly aircraft . " Commandant Chuang Chung-i goes on to explain that the students ' most common mistake is not giving clear enough instructions , so that an advantage only ten seconds away is lost through delay . " In a real combat situation , that would mean being shot down and killed . "  
Yao Yi-wei argues that the most artistic , refined drama is one that meticulously " makes the unreal real , " whereas " making the real unreal " is rampant in society . Legislators who throw fists in front of the cameras can be amiable and laughing the instant they are out of the lens . This type of even more bizarre , more stimulating " performance " has diverted society 's attention . Who 's around to appreciate the real artists giving their all on stage ?  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
His strange dress and vulgar language might have sold a million recordings , maintained the critic , but this kind of marketing would certainly shorten his real musical career . The response from the musician was to strip off his conventional dinner suit and black tie during a performance of Bach , revealing a garish purple jacket and shirt . He then accused the critic of making classical music an issue of class and the preserve of the elite .  
Chen Er-nan , a planner / designer at Hong Jian Industries , which accounts for half of the domestic market in man-made polyesters , says that natural silk is colder to the touch , that it is more rough and textured when rubbed , and that real silk lets air pass through , making it more comfortable to wear . Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
Pacific Construction , a real estate company chain that adopted a lot of parks , found itself scolded by some city council members as engaged in advertising and commercial activities , maybe because its signs were too conspicuous . " We thought we were going to raise our corporate image , and instead we spent all that money and wound up getting yelled at , " they say , feeling much abused .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Maintain Flexibility : Big corporations invest not only in real estate , they also invest in the restaurant , dry goods , and gift industries , consequently merging several stores to become a largescale shopping center . Restaurants have also become beautifully decorated with service provided by equally well adorned girls . This is a direct challenge to established enterprises . "  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
Casual and easygoing in real life , she came to the studio dressed in a house robe and slippers , just like the character she played , which was down-home , offbeat and outspoken . Even though hers was only a supporting role , her natural , unaffected style of acting won over audiences and made the show a hit , boosting her career to new heights .  
For example , the Lungshan Temple in Lukang could be listed as a world class artifact . The quality of the construction , the interior environment , and the primitive construction have all been preserved rather well . In particular , having National Heritage Award winner Wang Kun-shan 's nan-kuan troupe inside gave the old temple real vitality ; I really loved that .  
First of all , father became much more clearheaded and even his extra workload could not ruffle his calm tranquility . Then there was mother , who became even more concerned about people , often asking my younger brother 's fellow students to come over and eat . My elder brothers also gradually grew less vain as they turned to the pursuit of real inner worth .  
Take Taipei as an example : Heavy traffic flows along the main roads and spreads out into narrow lanes which are full of parked cars and motorcycles ; real plans to give pedestrians more space are limited with expanded tiny sidewalks becoming spaces for illegal parking and crudely designed underpasses turning into dark , no-go areas .  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
Also , Lisa 's grasp of the computer profession is so good that she can be very faithful and fluent , and she can translate concisely while maintaining the subtle innuendos and insinuating tones . " For example , she used a slang term in Taiwanese meaning " Is that real ? " to express the dubious veracity of an event . She described the end of a big computer exhibition as a " leftover meal . " Such succinct and incisive language causes readers to infuse their own imagination into the spaces of the text .  
He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .  
In his simple and idealistic visual presentations , Ku Shih-yung , who has won the Taipei Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art two times running , is neither making an argument nor a statement of protest , nor trying to describe anything at all . Rather he creates a dialectic between the real and imaginary to stimulate people 's memories and thus bring them into his philosophical utopia .  
And the cost of making installations far exceeds paintings or sculptures . " This is an extravagant way of opposing commercialism , refusing to be coerced in any way , determinedly pursuing one 's own ideas and boldly striking out in new directions . But it is also possible that the artist will just give up when facing the setbacks of the real world , " says a suffering Huang Wen-hao , sounding sometimes high spirited and sometimes down and out .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
Some people have criticized Tsui Hark 's Huang Fei-hong as " superficial " and lacking the real martial skills of a great master . The constant use of ropes , of special effects which go beyond the humanly and physically possible , and of speededup action , the all-pervading Chinese popular aesthetic , the dramatic camera angles , the melodramatic dialogues and plot development , create an overall effect which is " very exciting , " but the special qualities of the main character Huang Fei-hong become rather blurred .  
In a photograph , a concrete model animal , of a kind which can be seen anywhere in Taiwan , is pictured in the most natural , realistic style ; it looks so false - - and yet so real .  
Furthermore , deeper investigation is required into many questions , such as how many shark species are currently commercially fished and exploited , which commercial shark species ' populations are falling because of both shark meat and shark fin consumption and which purely due to demand for shark fins , and which real shark species ' fins are actually referred to by such shark fin market terminology as " white fin , " " black fin , " " Luzon yellow " or " tailhook . "  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
Under the mandate of discouraging nude dance as a form of worship , electronically animated mannequins appeared at one point as substitutes . But though the mannequins ' figures were no less shapely than real performers , and from time to time , they would un veil their gauzy outer garments , fakes , after all , were unable to invoke the same heated response .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
The cans and bottles , with a thin layer of dirt and decayed leaves stuck to the bottom , have been picked up , but few of the onlookers realize yet that the real secret lies in the water inside the container . The two veterans at this game open their backpacks , take out a strainer and a small handled pan , and set to work .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
In keeping with this principle , any enclosed space can be made into a " pinhole camera " by piercing a small hole in it . Rays of light passing through the pinhole cause a vertically and laterally inverted real image of the object in view to fall onto the surface opposite it , as illustrated in the diagram above .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
The Chinese insistence on morality and harmony has certainly destroyed many potential happy marriages . But when , in the face of the setbacks and buffets of real life , people are forced to suppress their emotions , these filter into the deepest parts of life and give rise to a warmth and sincerity which are lasting and inexhaustible-an inward , hidden " classical love . "  
We read the magazine over and over again , as if we were thirsty or starving for the impressive and charming articles . We read everything : each paragraph , each sentence , each character , even each punctuation mark . We pored over and enjoyed the real and inviting photographs , scrupulously examining them , afraid that we would leave out a minor detail , a faint smile .  
Vegetable substitutes for poultry , red meat , and all kinds of seafood can in fact taste even better than the real thing . Chinese have always set great store by selecting holiday foods that symbolize high hopes for the coming year . Thus over time many dishes have acquired auspicious sounding names designed to add to the festive atmosphere .  
In terms of texture , the proportions of protein and fiber can be adjusted to produce different sensations . Thus , chicken is relatively coarse , so the substitute is made with a higher proportion of fiber . Fish is more tender , so the protein content is raised . Add to this that the dishes are processed using the same cooking techniques as for meat-frying in oil , roasting-and the result is that you can hardly tell the veggies from the real things .  
Many people set themselves up as great religious masters , but their actions are quite at odds with their own teachings , " Sogyal Rinpoche says . He says a real master must be of a certain " lineage " through which teachings are transmitted to him . He must have a flawless character , and most importantly , has to be " selfless , " " compassionate " and " wise . " If people observe carefully , they should be able to tell the difference .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
In those days everything was at a high standard of performance . Performers had to undertake formal study with a master for three years and four months . The troupes did not hesitate to spend exorbitant amounts on props , costumes , and new scripts and songs . There were also dynamic scenery and props such as " real rainwater pouring down " and " the bottomless coffin " ( so the " deceased " could get out and suddenly pop up elsewhere ) .  
Today , people are too busy trying to maintain the minimum requirements for their physical existences to have that kind of relaxed , merry perspective on life . I 'm afraid few people indeed are able to address the real world with a " heart of frequent leisure . "  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated . What he likes is to capture human nature , as in the Chinese opera classic The Fourth Son Visiting His Mother , which retains its emotional impact today because the son is torn between family and country , wife and mother .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
Leaving behind the " real virtuality " of Taitien Temple 's heaven , the lush and verdant mortal world around us is vibrant with the sound of cicadas , and a light breeze caresses our skins . The ticket seller dozes peacefully after eating his packed lunch . Is he roaming through heaven in his dreams ?  
Although in the minds of the ancients fairylands were extensions of the real world , the more distant and unattainable they were , the more scope they left for the imagination . The island of Penglai was hazy and indistinct , and the mountains of Kunlun vague and remote .  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
In southern Taiwan , although the election for mayor of Kaohsiung also included an independent candidate , Cheng Te-yao , and an NP candidate , Wu Chien-kuo , the real battle remained that between the DPP 's Frank Hsieh and the KMT 's Wu Den-yih . From the very beginning of the campaign it was thought that Hsieh had little chance of winning , having been involved in the Sung Chi-li cult scandal and facing an incumbent with eight years of experience as mayor . At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .  
Laozi says of the Way : " There was something composed of many things , before heaven and earth were born . " The Way existed before the material world , and seems to move in a never-ending cycle characterized by " departing , becoming distant and returning . " It is an invisible and unceasing motive force within the universe , and the real creator and mover of all visible , physical things .  
" With this behavioral outlet , people do n't consider the more important question of improvement . " Yeh says that the stray dogs " set free " onto Taiwan 's streets are symptomatic of people 's ingrained reluctance to face up to the real suffering of living things .  
Hsiao Lin says that as soon as she removed her clothes , her friend Rongrong got all stone-faced , as if given a frightful scare . Previously , in women 's club meetings at school she was always full of righteous opinion on body issues , demonstrating far-left thinking , and prior to the photo shoot they had engaged in quite a bit of discussion and joked around a lot . So it came as a surprise when Rongrong " lost her wits " when it came down to real business .  
Other fields are also booming : With Y2K just around the corner , demand for computer experts is rising . There 's a great demand for marketing personnel in the mobile phone industry . The financial , insurance , and real estate industries are moving toward increasing professionalization and are absorbing and training a large number of new people .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
Her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and Chiung Yao 's series departed too far from reality . This in fact has been a chronic problem of Taiwan 's dramatic serials . " Love succeeded largely because it wedded realism to Taiwanese subject matter .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
The idea of an imaginary miniature world become real is one that seemingly everyone has entertained at one time or another , and it has been represented in art in many ways . China has its bonsai , miniature rock gardens , calligraphy on grains of rice , and jewelry boxes . The West has its eggshell sculpture and model cars . And what could be more representative of miniaturized art than the dollhouses that are so popular in Europe , North America , and Japan ?  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
The desired effect was that of genuine jade , with glass used to make ornaments such as shell-patterned white bi discs , brown cicada stones , and jade-green decorative swords . Such items often used to be mistaken for real jade .  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
Besides encouraging perverse ideas about violence and sex , TV promotes superficiality , crudity and superstition . Things shown in the media often deviate sharply from what children are taught in school or need to know in real life . " It 's really worrying that a lot of nonsense which is meant merely to be for the entertainment of adults becomes accepted as authoritative by minors , " says Joyce Yen Feng .  
They 've got genuine leather furniture , real wood floors , and shelves lined with tens of thousands of manga comics and magazines . Every computer has a 15-inch flat panel display . At the other end of the market , you can go down to Pingtung in southern Taiwan and find very unassuming little Internet cafes with modest decor , barebones equipment , and none of the " all you can eat and drink " signs you 're apt to find in up-market establishments . How many is too many ?  
Apex 's major product at the moment , the alternating pressure pump mattress , is aimed at preventing bedsores , a real nightmare for bedridden patients . Bedsores result from hard mattresses causing parts of the body that bear the most weight ( such as the buttocks and the shoulders ) to be deprived of oxygen and consequently suffer necrosis ( i.e . tissue death ) . This is accompanied by ulceration , suppuration and infestation , from which recovery is very difficult .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
Since the middle of this year , Citibank ( acting through Debenham Tie Leung , a property management firm based in Hong Kong ) has held a series of auctions in Taipei and Kao-hsiung to sell properties from defaulted mortgages at steep discounts . Prices at these auctions have been about 60% of the open market price , sending shock waves through the real estate and financial industries .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
They are equipped not only with radar , wireless communication equipment , and net winches , but everything actually is operable , and even the doors and windows can be opened and closed . His handiwork captures the real thing so well that it 's downright spooky . Even old seadogs gush in praise when they see his boats .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
Trend expert John Naisbitt , in his High Tech , High Touch : Technology and Our Search for Meaning , discusses the threat posed to American youth by violent virtual reality games ( especially lifelike combat games ) , stating that they render children unable to distinguish between real and virtual . This in turn has generated a slew of on-campus firearms attacks that have left American society reeling .  
" A virtual studio is also called a blue-screen studio or green-screen studio , " says Andy Wang , vice president for 3D graphics and virtual reality at Imagetech , the first production company in Taiwan to introduce virtual studio technology . He explains that the spacious virtual studio only has simple props , but the blue background is removed from the image by computer and replaced in real time with scenes prepared in advance using Maya or Max software , so that the combined image can be directly broadcast .  
At the end of June , the Executive Yuan established a special team to outline financial reforms . Invoking existing banking laws , the Ministry of Finance announced a tiered management policy for the credit departments of farmers ' and fishermen 's associations . The goal was to follow up on the August 2001 partial intervention ( in which a special fund was used to take over and restructure 36 of the worst-run ones ) by tackling the widespread problem of unrepaid loans at these credit institutions , to protect farmers ' real interests .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
Before me lay a vast lifeless stretch of yellow , the terrifying Sahara desert that I had read about in geography textbooks when I was a child . Only now it was n't just a name , but was a real place , right under my feet . How could one not feel a rising sense of panic ? !  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously . Only in this way will they truly be able to seize the moment and usher in real political reform and a deepening of the democratic process .  
Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
Society should not only encourage young people to have more diversified dreams , it should let them see behind truly successful people-and especially those who have devoted genuine effort to their dreams and stuck to their guns , or those who have had the courage to change their ways when they discovered that they had mistaken the illusory for the real .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
Of this effective marketing strategy , clinic director Anton Staudinger says with some pride , " Our patients feel reassured as soon as they see that our TCM doctors are real Chinese people . " Dr . Staudinger says with a smile , " We do n't have enough beds to meet demand . We have 80 beds that are occupied all the year round , and prospective patients spend several months on waiting lists to gain admission . "  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
Kuo then set up the artkey company . Using the then-new medium of the Internet as an art gallery , he staged the " SohoArt " Internet art exhibition and a " Top100 artworks " national artwork poll . He also set up a global Chinese arts directory and invited 100 artists to participate in a major exhibit over the Internet , giving artists , who previously had kept a respectful distance from technology , a real opportunity to get on the web .  
For instance , in his freshman year he easily won first prize in a violin competition . But the real reason he moved in the direction of music was probably that he had a crush on a female classmate of his , a girl with long flowing hair who also played violin well . Just to be near her , Lee transferred to the Department of Music , hoping he could win her over .  
Gourds would become a way of life , a creative lynchpin , and the foundation for making the village self-sufficient . Over the years , Kung Yi-fang has used his amazing imagination and selfless attitude to develop and teach his craft , successfully bringing art out of the constrictive world of glass display cases and into the real world . Through Kung 's works , more and more people are coming to appreciate the beauty inherent in even something as simple as a gourd .  
The fires continue to flicker ; the world continues to evolve ; and explorers continue to explore , walking endlessly into the vast unknown and shedding light on the mysterious corners of human nature , like a light searching out the real self .  
These schools provide a support base for the museum , helping to recover personnel and other costs . The museum provides the ideological foundation for the classes , the education being based on the ideas espoused by the gallery and put into practice in the classes . Lin has been running these two organizations for years now in her effort to try and free people 's artistry from the shackles it has been placed in , and to let children be able to sample the emotional qualities inherent in real art .  
With regard to the shocking nature of both the Body Worlds exhibit and the abortion film , all of the above scholars agree that without accompanying documents , lectures , explanations or discussions to allay audience anxieties , simply relying on what is visually apparent will not suffice to reveal the true meaning of life education . Instead , such events may lead to further confusion of public values and errors in understanding . This is where their real concern lies .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
Shihpai , along with neighboring areas eastward to Tienmu and westward to Kuantu , has traditionally been an epicenter of high-value real estate in Taipei . Following the current resurgence , a realty office franchise sandwiched between a bakery and a hardware store next to the Shihpai MRT station witnesses an endless flow of individuals inquiring about real estate daily from the moment the doors open at eight o'clock in the morning till they close at 11 at night .  
That coupled with a surge in new ways to invest money have added up to a diminished interest in real estate as an investment . In other words , the people driving this round of house buying are those purchasing homes for their own use , rather than investors looking for a hedge against inflation or international speculators hoping to make a quick buck . The overall market has been growing steadily .  
Victor Chang sums it up this way : " In the past , Taiwan 's real estate market was ailing , so , just as an ill person takes medicine , a restorative tonic was applied , consisting of preferential home loans , halved land value increment tax , and foreign investment . Close examination should reveal whether the market has improved as a result of the treatment . "  
After gaining the understanding of and establishing mutual trust with his previous employer , Chung went into the same business of contract manufacturing of inverters . However , he was scrupulous in not poaching his previous employer 's customers , even as he expanded his two-person company into a factory employing more than 50 people in just three or four years . He was also occupied by additional investments in more than ten different industries , including real estate , computers , import / export trade , automotive care , and energy-efficient light bulbs .  
The Pan Kung gate is the outermost gate of the temple , but during their occupation of Taiwan the Japanese split the gate from the rest of the temple structure when they built Nanmen Road between them . Since the gate was split from the temple proper , its real purpose has gradually faded from collective memory , so it 's not surprising so few people realize it 's actually part of the temple .  
The area was once central Taiwan 's main aquacultural center , with all kinds of fish being raised there . Traders would come from around the island to strike deals with the local farmers , who did double duty as their own wholesalers . For a while , trade was brisk , but over recent decades the industry has been on the decline , and is now of little real note . Already it seems like people are forgetting this important part of Taiwan 's history .  
A major factor in the rural-urban shift in population is the real or perceived disparities between urban and rural areas in economic opportunities and in social and cultural amenities .  
The collapse of empires has let loose the savage impulse to settle historical scores , redress ancient ethnic grievances , and set right real or imagined injustices over national borders , the treatment of minorities , or the control of resources .  
The representative of FICSA expressed concern at the rapid change in the New York / Washington costofliving differential and hoped that it did not indicate inherent instability in the model chosen , but represented its sensitivity to real external factors .  
Notwithstanding , real GDP registered a negative growth rate of minus 2.8 per cent in 1992 against a planned positive growth rate of 2 per cent as the deterioration in the economic situation was compounded by drought .  
She said that despite numerous laws , which guaranteed women social , political , economic and educational rights , certain traditions and values of a negative nature still affected attitudes towards women and impeded their real participation .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
Neither massive economic assistance , nor a huge international presence can make a real difference if the human rights questions are left unaddressed .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
The so-called underdeveloped world is not calling on the international community for hand-outs or privileged positions in trade ; all it is asking for is fair , transparent and egalitarian treatment , with terms of trade that are not distorted by political pricing , hidden subsidies and dumping practices whose persistence in international trade causes real havoc in the economies of a large number of nations .  
Throughout the gradual transition , the summit meetings of the Central American Presidents have institutionalized the process of regional integration and have given concrete form to the commitments undertaken in Esquipulas II , in which Central America pledged to struggle for peace and eradicate war , to ensure that dialogue prevailed over violence and reason over rancour , to give impetus to real democratic processes , and to promote justice and respect for human rights . 
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
In addition to the great efforts to reform the United Nations system and thus enable the Organization to meet the growing challenges of the future , the practice of transparency by which I mean a daily striving for real contributions to be made to the Council 's decision-making process by all countries concerned is a feasible and practicable course .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s recommended a minimum annual level of $ 30-billion in net official assistance in 1992 if an average annual growth of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent was to be achieved by the year 2000 .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
That effort , which was fully in keeping with many of the objectives agreed at the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development , sought to create real conditions for the overall development of the country on the basis of economic and social stability , guarantee minimum conditions for the development of individuals , families and communities and to carry out international agreements reached at the relevant United Nations conferences .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
It provided a real and immediate opportunity for the Palestinian people and their nascent government authority to elaborate appropriate policies , establish and build credible institutions and implement urgent programmes aimed at guiding the process of structural transformation in the occupied territory during the five-year interim period .  
At the same time , on the domestic front , Turkey is not prepared even to discuss a multi-ethnic and multicultural concept , hence flagrantly and on a large-scale basis violating the human , national and political rights of the Kurds , waging a real internal war against them .  
In reply to concerns raised by the Committee relating to the real force of this provision , the representative stated that , effectively , the Constitution of Peru provided that international treaties concluded by Peru formed part of municipal law , and , accordingly , article 2 , which established that everybody is equal and can not be discriminated against by reason of sex , was part of the law of the land .  
Among the most acute issues were the continuing economic deterioration , the decline in real incomes , the spread of poverty , unemployment , massive migration and a sharp worsening of living standards for what appeared to be the majority of the population .  
These have been actively considered by UNDP within the broad framework of a strategic management initiative aimed at harmonizing three distinct components of UNDP programming : strategic planning - addressing its basic mission and strategies ; operational planning - focusing on means of achieving results ; and results management - analysing , through monitoring , review and evaluation , real performance against stated plans .  
Undoubtedly the establishment by the Security Council of ad hoc tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda marks a momentous progress in the fight against human rights abuses and fleshes out the basic demand for international justice as a means of contributing to real and lasting peace in countries torn by armed conflict and beset by large-scale disregard of human dignity .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
This latter definition is the real meaning of " intrinsic " as used in these legal instruments , and in any case the words " essential " and " inherent " do not mean that the adverse effects on the environment per se constitute a form of harm which is independent of human beings .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The lack of concrete progress in the political process and , which is even more serious , with regard to the cease-fire , the lack of harmonization in the policies and efforts of all the parties involved and the unfortunate continuation of the flow of arms to the country have now made it necessary to make international support conditional on the existence of real , concrete political will among the parties peacefully to resolve their differences and achieve national reconciliation .  
The real challenge in the area of reforming the social sector is to transcend the current limitations of its organizations , which are isolated , inflexible , overly centralized , hostile to genuine participation , unwilling to address the problems created by power struggles , reluctant to cooperate , of insufficient importance in the State apparatus and lacking in professional career paths for managers and in managers with specialized training in the social sphere .  
The strengthening of the offensive capabilities of the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus , coupled with the completion of extensive fortifications all along the buffer zone , are indicative of the real intentions of Turkey in Cyprus : that is , the imposition of a military solution , something to which Turkey resorts with utter contempt to international law and civilized behaviour .  
In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Although the use of this recourse legally conceals an individual 's real status as a mercenary , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services arranged for and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports may serve as evidence in establishing the true status of persons who are justifiably suspected of engaging in mercenary activities .  
One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
At a time when a real chance for a just and lasting peace , which would satisfy the vital interests of all three peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina is at last within reach , it is essential that this opportunity should not be missed and that all measures be taken so that NATO air strikes which threaten to undermine the entire peace process are immediately stopped .  
Thus , the Special Rapporteur now defines visual pornography as " the visual depiction of a child engaged in explicit sexual activity , real or simulated , or the lewd exhibition of genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material " .  
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .  
However , for real progress to be achieved , my Special Envoy believes that both sides must show concrete signs that they are willing and able to reach and implement a comprehensive settlement , based on three essential elements - the safe and early return of the refugees and internally displaced persons , maintenance of the territorial integrity of Georgia and a special status for Abkhazia .  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .  
He stressed the need to reach a consensus on a fair and equitable apportionment of the expenses of the Organization and reiterated that the real capacity of Member States to pay was the fundamental criterion for determining a scale which would be acceptable to all and would help to strengthen the financial basis of the Organization and of the United Nations system .  
when ratifying a convention , a State declared under the terms of its reservation that it was bound by the instrument only in so far as it was not contrary to domestic legislation , then in real terms it had not accepted any international obligation , and the appearance of its name on the list of signatories was irrelevant .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
It is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum of $ 30-billion in official development assistance was required in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in African countries over the course of the 1990s .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
If the world can focus its energies on ending the testing of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons , we believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves the goal of ending the use of the most simple , cheap and , on a daily basis , most destructive weapon in use today , the anti-personnel landmine .  
We feel that all the working papers submitted and statements made demonstrate the necessity of providing any eventual fourth special session with real and pragmatic content ; otherwise , we will merely be repeating a sterile exercise which , because of its content , would not enjoy consensus among the members of the international community .  
Capital spending has been the main engine of growth in the current cycle , with non-residential fixed investment in 1993-1995 rising at annual average rates of close to 14 per cent in real terms .  
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .  I should now like to turn to the other , technical draft resolution before the Council .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
Among the economic and social factors influencing this process are population growth and voluntary and involuntary migration , real and perceived employment opportunities , cultural expectations , changing consumption and production patterns and serious imbalances and disparities among regions . 
Fourth , disbursements of official development finance ( ODF ) fell : concessional disbursements of official development assistance ( ODA ) rose in both nominal and real terms , but multilateral net lending on non-concessional terms dropped substantially and bilateral net lending on non-concessional terms rose only slightly .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
" Model guns " are toy guns made of metal that have forms similar to genuine handguns and that can be made into real guns .  In this context , " clean controlled delivery " involves secret replacement of an illegal handgun with a legal substitute .  
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
The capacity of African societies and economies for real and sustained growth are being increasingly realized , as most economic policies are now focused on the creation of an enabling environment for the private sector and efficient operation of the market economy .  
The statements made by the Secretary-General to date that no additional mandates can be absorbed have been based upon an assumption that budgeted cost levels and exchange rates will be fulfilled and that the level of real resources ( number of posts , vacancy rates , etc . ) assumed under the $ 2.6-billion appropriation will also evolve as anticipated and that efficiency gains now identified would be applied to achieving the mandated budget reduction of $ 154-million .  
Apart from the general objection to the real or assumed punitive connotation of some of the consequences envisaged in draft article 16 - an objection obviously connected with the general conceptual and terminological issue we set aside [ 4 ] / - a number of specific reservations were expressed .  
It is widely acknowledged in Sarajevo that the joint international effort to keep essential utilities functioning and begin the restoration of the city 's physical infrastructure made a real difference by enabling the citizens of Sarajevo to survive , particularly during winter months , and by giving them hope for the future .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
Article 9.2 : " It is incumbent upon the public authorities to promote conditions which ensure that the freedom and equality of individuals and of the groups to which they belong are real and effective , to remove obstacles which prevent or hinder their full enjoyment , and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political , economic , cultural and social life . "  
It will be seen below that all the autonomous communities have some public body responsible for ensuring that all forms of discrimination are truly eliminated , as well as for taking whatever steps are required to bring about real equality in all areas of public , economic , cultural and social life .  
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
" Deeply concerned about the significant decline in resources allocated to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , the incomplete tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and prospects for the eleventh replenishment at significantly reduced real levels , which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in pursuing collaboration and their role in the field of development ,  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
The Special Rapporteur repeats that no peace worthy of the name can be established in Burundi unless an equitable solution is found to the above-mentioned problem , a solution that provides strong guarantees to the minority once and for all , ensures respect for democracy and leads , at last , to a real sharing of power on concrete and realistic bases , so that the tremendous social and economic inequalities that continue to beset Burundi society may be overcome .  
The Lusaka Protocol , signed on 20 November 1994 , opened real and promising prospects for lasting peace in Angola , and , through agreed arrangements , provides an appropriate framework for the Angolan people to transcend the causes of a particularly devastating and ravaging conflict and to devote themselves finally to the immense task of national reconstruction .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The series fills a real gap on the human-rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
The vast majority of the Russian-speaking population of Latvia , like that of Estonia , was initially deprived of citizenship , and then of the real possibility of obtaining it , and thus is prevented from participating in elections , deprived of the right to purchase land , and subjected to considerable limitations on the rights to privatize and to establish joint stock companies , as well as to occupy posts in the public administration .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at the 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .

Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In conclusion , while emphasizing our consistent and principled positions , we affirm our readiness to coordinate and cooperate with other peace-loving States , as well as with the relevant international organizations , for the realization of a real and genuine peace based on the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments . Sixth .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Only substantive consideration by the Council of the legitimate interests and concerns expressed by Member States during the debates can accurately guide the Council in its work and provide it with the necessary and impartial information that will enable it to assess the real causes of conflicts , counteract their consequences and take action to find just and lasting solutions , free from politically motivated prejudices and not dominated by the illegitimate interests of just one country or a small group of countries .  
Likewise , for democracy to have real meaning for it to be an ideal shared by all peoples and for it to fully achieve its liberating and saving effects it must be unambiguously expressed both at the national and the international levels .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
They needed to be applied impartially , on the basis of specific criteria and a clear timetable , and only when there was a real threat to international peace and security .  The possibility of adopting smart sanctions , which would not affect innocent civilians or cause undue suffering , had been discussed .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
The mission focused on balancing real radiological risks against economic , social and psychological problems , and generating together with the authorities of the concerned countries realistic projects with a high likelihood of success , leading to measurable improvements in the current conditions under which the population was living .  
These national services , working collaboratively in real time , provide the unique operational capabilities of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) , a coordinated international system of national meteorological and hydrological services that is based on the common acceptance of protocols and standard terminology .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
The international community has come to realize that only an integrated and holistic response to the issue of landmine contamination , and its multifaceted humanitarian and socio-economic consequences , is capable of bringing real and lasting benefits to those who are considered at risk from those weapons .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 , 1994 and , more recently , in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
I wish to reiterate that , while we fully support the noble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines , a sweeping ban can not be a satisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of Korea , which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence of all-out war , and whose heavily populated capital is only 25 miles from the military demarcation line .  
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
The ministerial meeting of the Security Council devoted to Africa , held on the commendable initiative of the United States last 25 September , led to a fruitful exchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of the international community to become more actively , more significantly and more concretely involved in a new type of partnership with Africa in order to contribute to its development .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
The cold war had just ended , and barriers both real and perceived were falling , paving the way for precisely this type of treaty negotiated on a multilateral basis , as opposed to the bipolar accords with which the world was more familiar .  
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
It was stressed that the very high real interest rates in transitional economies such as Kazakstan were characteristic of a transitional period of macro adjustment and reflected high levels of uncertainty and perceived risks to lenders ; such rates did not represent equilibrium conditions and far exceeded the possibilities for most enterprises to generate sufficient real income . 
If an Annex A or Annex B Party achieves real reductions in net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases which are greater than that determined by its commitments , this difference ( in terms of the sum of annual reductions of tonnes of carbon equivalent ) is registered as a contribution to the fulfillment of that Party 's commitments for the next period .  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,

Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,

In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
She was disappointed and alarmed at the continuing real decline in official development assistance over the past four years and the overwhelming concentration of foreign direct investment in only a handful of countries .  
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
The right to development , which was a basic right , was essential for promoting and protecting economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , since poverty was a real obstacle to the effective enjoyment of those rights . 
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
In order for countries to have a real chance to eradicate poverty , they must achieve sustained economic growth , accompanied by increased public expenditure in the social sector , which could take place only in an expanding national economy .  
The complex issues raised by migration should be addressed in a constructive manner in order to build a future of tolerance and mutual understanding and to dispel the very real fears associated with the phenomenon .  
The scale should remain predictable and stable and should continue to be based on real capacity to pay , as determined according to transparent procedures and adequate information on the economic situation of Member States .  
Lastly , it was reported that , in recent years , paramilitary organizations had increasingly practised selective disappearance of civic leaders perceived as real or potential guerrilla supporters .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
Meanwhile , we must let the rest of the world understand the real nature of this conflict - that this is not just another internal conflict in some small and distant developing country , but an armed rebellion , externally inspired and maintained , against the people of Sierra Leone and their democratically elected Government .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .

The economic recovery programme and economic policy measures laid the foundation for accelerated privatization in FRY , opening up of the economy and other measures aimed at increased productivity , starting with improved conditions of business operations and the creation of real possibilities for enterprises to rid themselves of redundant workers , as well as at resolving employment issues and providing for the subsistence of these workers outside enterprises . 
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Firstly , international cooperation in the collection , collation and interpretation of observations of near-Earth objects is essential for early assessment of the tiny , but real risk of a potentially devastating impact in the foreseeable future and to refine the precise computations needed for any mitigation measures in case a significant danger of an impact were to be substantiated .  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
During 1995-1999 , stock markets in the United States , as measured by the performance of the Standard and Poors 500 index ( the S &amp; amp ; P 500 ) deflated by the consumer price index ( CPI ) , registered an average annual real return of 24 per cent , double the average over the last century .  
The booming stock markets have been closely interrelated with rapid ICT innovations and the strong performance of the real economy , yielding a virtuous circle .  
The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
Furthermore , this motivation ( in the direct interest of the non-indigenous party ) was quite clear : to legitimize ( via the acquiescence of the autochthonous sovereign of the territories in question ) any right ( real or intended ) with which they could counter opposing claims advanced by other colonial powers vying for control of those lands .  
immediate restitution of all illegally and forcibly taken real estate to its rightful private and State owners , and reinstatement of those employed in the private and public sectors who were dismissed from their jobs because of the tacit and tolerant attitude of UNMIK and KFOR ;

In order to build a firm foundation for real and enduring peace and security , it was essential to eliminate the root causes of conflict , be they of a political , ethnic , economic , social or other nature .  
His delegation felt that the approach based on zero real or nominal growth ceilings was artificial and should be abandoned in favour of a new method which would primarily take account of programmes defined by common consent , the Secretariats role being to evaluate the resources required for their implementation .  
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
During this time of increased calls for international resources for Kosovo and other parts of the world , when donor fatigue for Bosnia and Herzegovina is very real , the continued unwillingness of substantial parts of the local leadership to create conditions conducive to returns and to the integral implementation of the Dayton peace agreement can not be tolerated . 
While we recognize the difficulty of achieving smart sanctions in the real world , we also believe that there is a continuing need to minimize collateral , unintended humanitarian suffering through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and mechanisms for periodic substantive reviews .  
While we recognize the difficulty in the real world of achieving smart sanctions , we believe that there is a recurring need to minimize the collateral though unintended human suffering , through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and periodic review mechanisms .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives , recognized as legal entities , are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises , and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement .  
In the modern world , the development of national scientific and technological capacities was essential for increasing the competitiveness of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition and ensuring their real integration into the world economic system .  
The question of nationality was further complicated when , as a result of a succession of States , two or more legal systems collided or overlapped , and ostensibly logical and transparent criteria of nationality proved to be obscure and elusive when applied in real circumstances . 
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
If world commodity markets are left to the &amp; lt ; free play of market forces = , while much high-cost agriculture in developed countries - - even after the Uruguay Round - - continues to be subsidized , the underlying problem of the downward trend in real prices of commodities exported by developing countries is likely to persist .  
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
It not only affected those who were subject to its direct indiscriminate attacks , but it posed a real threat to international peace and security , and endangered the political process in the international arena , including the peace process in the Middle East .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
If we do not rapidly take effective measures to correct the negative effects of that process , the threats of social disintegration will become increasingly real and disturbing , and the possibility of establishing stability and lasting peace even more remote .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .

The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance . 
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
Here , too , it is apparent that without a more favourable international environment , without significant financial input , without real alleviation , if not outright cancellation , of the debt and without a sustained and lasting rate of growth , the laudable and courageous efforts and the sacrifices made so far by the African countries will prove insufficient , if not useless , in the face of the great needs of the African peoples .  
We have also drafted complementary projects , such as the national system for the selection of beneficiaries , aimed at providing flexible , transparent and decentralized assistance to the neediest families and households , and the system to follow up and assess policies and social programmes designed to evaluate on an ongoing basis the efficiency and real effectiveness of policies and public spending on social programmes .  
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
In order to bring about real improvements in the human rights situation in the whole region , it was necessary to adopt a positive strategy aimed at gradually opening up all those societies , rather than resorting to partial measures or economic sanctions resulting in the weakening of the forces of democracy and the emerging civil society , which provided the only guarantees for the promotion and respect of human rights .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes requires the deployment of substantial resources that exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Inter-area price information at both the national and international levels is essential to a proper understanding and analysis of real economic differences in a spatial context .  
Considering the size and nature of the Missions real estate , which includes 166 observation posts and 14 primary United Nations camps locations including accommodations , offices and other premises , and in line with the recommendation of the internal auditors , it is important that a civil engineer be assigned to oversee the planning , repair and renovation of the premises in order to ensure the most economic , efficient and effective utilization of resources .  
Since , in Chile , credit approval depends on the applicants solvency and ability to offer sufficient collateral , with real property being preferred to personal property , married women under the joint ownership regime face legal obstacles .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Participants affirmed that national sovereignty should not be exercised at the expense of respect for human rights , and that real efforts towards the co-development of countries north and south of the Mediterranean , as well as the strengthening of the rule of law , would contribute to reducing erratic migratory flows and facilitate economic cooperation , mutual understanding and cultural exchanges .  
With the understanding and support of the international community and motivated by the desire to find real , definitive and peaceful solutions to disputes , we successfully moved forward and created peace and tangible progress for our peoples .  
Mr . Sareva ( Finland ) , speaking on behalf of the European Union , the associated countries Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Malta , Romania and Slovenia and , in addition , Iceland , said that it was necessary to devise a more equitable , stable , simple and transparent scale of assessments based on reliable , verifiable and comparable data and reflecting each Member States real capacity to pay .  
While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
The basis for the Security Council 's action is , above all , the recognition that flagrant , grave and systematic violations of universally accepted international humanitarian and human rights law may pose a real threat to international peace and security .  
Such economic , social and development policy measures have proven taxing on the national budget of an economy burdened with reconstruction , low investment and real growth rates and high unemployment , as is always the case in a postconflict society .  
She also interpreted any representation , by whatever means , of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities not to be applicable to adults acting , posing or dressing as a child .  
The United States understood the definition to include the visual representation of a child , engaged in real or simulated sexual activities , or of the genitalia of a child where the dominant characteristic was depiction for a sexual purpose .  
As we look ahead , we can see real risks that resource depletion , especially freshwater scarcities , as well as severe forms of environmental degradation , may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways .  
It was noteworthy that the total resource level proposed for the section represented hardly any increase compared with the current appropriation in real terms but involved a considerable increase after recosting .  
In this regard , the collective Presidency is required to ensure the full implementation of the Accords , showing real political will at the domestic level while seeking complementary solutions at the regional level .  
If the forces of globalization are allowed to operate freely overlooking the central premise of humancentred development the spectre of massive levels of human rights violations resulting in grave social and political upheavals is a real one .  
He said India , which had over a-billion inhabitants and constituted a real ethnic , linguistic and religious patchwork , had chosen an economic , social and political model which was unique for a former colony with development problems .  
Unfortunately , the peacekeeping resources of the Organization are not limitless , and they must be apportioned in the best possible way , in a manner commensurate with the real danger posed by a given conflict to regional and global stability .  
Sixthly , the creation and entrenchment of robust legal structures which adequately defend the rights of civilians and act as a real deterrent to potential violators of international human rights law remains a vital component in a global approach to the protection of civilians .  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
But as long as the international community continues to pursue a piecemeal approach to the Balkans , in which loose coordination among a multitude of actors is an unsatisfactory substitute for purposeful planning , the real opportunities to close a tragic decade of war and instability will go begging .  
In this respect , the presence of political leaders who are prepared to handle social complaints and demands by violent means with a view to satisfying selfish political and economic ambitions is the real cause of , and an inevitable catalyst of , social violence and armed conflicts .  
For all genuine regional and international efforts to succeed in Somalia , it becomes necessary that all actors reach a common , objective and unbiased vision about the real tasks ahead .  
However , we strongly believe that the dynamic of the entire peace process can be maintained and moved forward only if the responsibilities and the political will of the parties is fulfilled and translated into real action .  
The long series of armed conflicts in Africa inevitably involving mercenaries organized in various ways offers harsh and brutal proof of the fact that the real and effective exercise of the right of many African peoples to self-determination has not been realized .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
Urge the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
In designing the orientation of its future work on globalization , ACC recognized the crucial role that the system , collectively , should play to build the knowledge and evidence base required to help develop effective , integrated responses capable of positively influencing globalization processes and their social impact , and of bringing real benefits to the poor .  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
Urges the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
The ruling is a positive sign , in that it was objective and made a point of stating that the investigation of the facts must continue , but at the same time it demonstrated the impunity surrounding such acts , in that the authorities responsible for the investigation were unable to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute the real culprits .  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
In terms of its real meaning , it bespoke a balance of terror , a cold-war calculation that the physical security and ultimate fate of hundreds of millions of human beings had to be held hostage to the prospect of instant annihilation .  
The unprecedented development of corporate , State and international information systems and the simultaneous expansion of opportunities of access to them have attained such a level that today practically every member of the international community will be exposed to a real risk of electronic attack by criminals or terrorists .
