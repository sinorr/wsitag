Etienne Clement , the director of UNESCO office in Cambodia , said the problem of massive looting and trafficking of underground heritages started about five years ago , when the Cambodian government successfully cracked down on illicit trafficking of stone statuary from famous temples , so heritage traffickers have began to smuggle " less spectacular ordinary antiquities . "  
Article 40 For the enterprise responsible for printing the renminbi and relevant personnel that have one of the following conditions , the People 's Bank of China will issue a warning , confiscate their profits obtained illegally , and impose on them a fine equivalent to between one and three times the value of the obtained illegal profits .  Those that do not have illicit gains will be fined between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .

The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
When headed by Vice Mayor Wang , the city government housing bureau was found to have violated the rules and developed unwanted houses in Meilin First Village and many other projects , thus sparking protests from several hundred home buyers , who were civil servants .  It was understood that the civil servants were unhappy with the housing bureau 's illicit transfer of some projects to Wang Ju 's son .  
The department for foreign trade and economic affairs must earnestly carry out its works well in examining and approving applications from the processing industry to process electronic game equipment and its parts and accessories and overseeing the re-export of the processed equipment , parts , and accessories out of the country .  It must coordinate with the customs houses to crack down on illicit activities in smuggling electronic game equipment , parts and accessories .  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .  To this end , the five countries will draw up relevant multilateral outlines as early as possible ;  
The 44th session of the IAEA General Conference , which started on 18 September , will review the IAEA 's 1999 annual report , as well as reports on stepping up international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiation safety , and radioactive waste safety , on intensifying the IAEA 's technological cooperation , and on preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials . 
This reporter has learned from an anticorruption and anti-bribery work conference held by Guangdong Province 's procuratorial organs the other day that this year , Guangdong Province has investigated and punished in accordance with the law a total of 172 cadres at and above county or department level and procuratorial organs concerned have seized or recovered through investigating such cases illicit cash or goods totaling more than 100 million yuan .  
As the principal responsible person of a local party committee , he abandoned the proper political responsibility of a leading cadre , discarded the principles of party spirit , became a crony of an illicit foreign businessman , went in for bartering power for money in a big way , led a number of cadres astray , damaged the party style and social atmosphere , ruined the party 's image , and damaged state interests , causing serious consequences to local economic and social development .  
The commission will deliberate preparations for the special session of the General Assembly to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international co-operation in addressing the problem of drug abuse and illicit trafficking .  
A Government spokesman said today ( Monday ) that the Dutiable Commodities ( Amendment ) Bill 1999 ( " the Bill " ) would be introduced to address two major practical difficulties encountered by C &amp; amp ; ED in taking prosecution action under such prohibitive provisions .  One lies in proving the supply of certain illicit fuel , while the other relates to proving the use of detreated oil ( oil with its chemical marker illegally removed ) or dutiable light diesel oil as fuel by vehicles .  
In response to a recent misleading agency report alleging that western criminals were laundering illicit money through the underground banking systems in Asian economies such as Hong Kong , the Commissioner for Narcotics , Mrs . Clarie Lo , said today ( Monday ) , " Hong Kong has all the necessary measures in place , including an ever improving legislative regime and strong enforcement actions , to counter money laundering .  
The TTF will focus its checks with the aid of intelligence and information gathered about the illegal importing and exporting patterns of certain illicit textile traders .  Any suspicious consignments and traders would be identified and appropriate measures will then be taken by the TTF or other investigative bureaux of the department .  This may include close surveillance on the activities of these illicit traders and transportation companies .  
" The presumption is reasonable because illicit fuel usually has a sulphur content higher than 0.05% by weight whereas light diesel oil from legitimate sources on which duty has been paid must have a sulphur content at or below 0.05% .  This is because the supply for vehicular use of light diesel oil with a sulphur content higher than 0.05% is prohibited under the Air Pollution Control ( Motor Vehicle Fuel ) Regulations .  
" The reversal in the crime trend is in large a result of measure taken under the CCB 's approach which led to successful prosecutions of cases handled by the Bureau , sending a warning to those who consider engaging in the illicit trade .  " In addition to enhanced sentences for prevalent offence under the OSCO , companies with dubious or allegedly uttered accounts may be required to produce material concerning their business upon the issue of an order under section 4 of the same ordinance , " the spokesman said .  
( c ) With the support of the Committee on the Promotion of Civic Education and the Commission on Youth , the Administration has been actively promoting civic awareness , social responsibility and positive values among the public , particularly young people , through various publicity channels , educational programmes and funding schemes .  The objective is to help nurture good citizenship and reduce the possibility of young people engaging in illicit activities .  
Mr Lo said : " The earlier conflicts of interests in Yuen Long have led to a series of violent acts by the two triad societies including wounding , criminal damage and arson which seriously endangered the life of the residents .  Thus , the Police planned an operation targeting the illicit activities of these two triad gangs and implemented the operation codenamed Mullington in late June with a view to dealing a blow on the gangs . "  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
In an unexpected development in this connection , to escape debt obligations a major shareholder in a venture-capital firm who has close ties with the ruling DPP has alleged the existence of a complex network of interlocking party and business funds involving illicit kickbacks to members of several different parties .  
States should review their domestic arrangements for the regulation and control of licit supplies of drugs , especially psychotropic substances , to ensure the satisfaction of legitimate and justified medical requirements and prevent illicit supply .  
States have made considerable progress in concluding bilateral , regional or multilateral agreements aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
To this precarious picture we must add the resurgence of social problems , such as juvenile delinquency , illicit trade in drugs and narcotics , unemployment , the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious effects of persistent drought and other natural disasters .  
Effective action at the global level was crucial in preventing and controlling the accumulation of illicit profits and in contributing to the impoverishment and weakening of criminal organizations .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
There has also been a holistic review of the current and future potential of remotely sensed data ( satellite and airborne ) for identification and monitoring of illicit crops ( that is , opium poppy , cannabis and coca ) .  
However , the international transfer of conventional arms as well as the increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking , have in recent decades acquired a dimension and qualitative characteristics that give rise to serious and urgent concerns .  
States continued to make progress in concluding bilateral , regional or multilateral agreements aimed at suppressing illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
Ecuador maintained its unwavering commitment to the joint development and use of mechanisms to combat illicit drug trafficking and had ratified numerous regional and international legal instruments relating to drugs .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of the illicit arms trade ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) .  
By its resolution 46 / 36 H , entitled " International arms transfers " , the General Assembly , inter alia , called upon all States to give high priority to eradicating the illicit trade in all kinds of weapons and military equipment , a most disturbing and dangerous phenomenon often associated with terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime and mercenary and other destabilizing activities , and to take urgent action towards that end , as recommended in the study submitted by the Secretary-General .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
Since national legislation varies from country to country and , in practice , the borderline between licit and illicit arms transfers may not always be apparent , measures conducive to [ harmonizing ] [ achieving common ] laws and / or regulations and procedures , [ as well as the means of enforcing them , ] should be developed at the international level to ensure effective control over the acquisition and transfer of weapons .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
The economic importance of this illicit trafficking , which continues at an increasing pace , is reflected in the following data : in 1993 tobacco smuggling represented , in conservative terms , nearly 20 per cent of the colony 's gross domestic product , and in 1995 the value of drugs brought into Spain from Gibraltar without being seized exceeded 200-billion pesetas , which is equivalent to $ 1.6-billion .  
The international community therefore has a special responsibility to check and curb these illicit arms transfers as a matter of the highest priority , as terrorism has emerged as the principal public enemy , often transcending national boundaries and threatening to tear apart the very fabric of civil society . 
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , in countries affected by the illicit drug problem , that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
It included , among others , an effective exchange of operative data and information , joint actions in intercepting the organized international traffic routes and many seminars abroad , which Yugoslav experts used to brush up their knowledge in the field of the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs .  
Discussion at the United Nations focused on issues such as limitations on conventional weapons ; transparency in international arms transfers and arms production ; curbing the illicit traffic in conventional arms ; transparency in military expenditures ; inhumane weapons and the Convention restricting their use ; and , recently , regulation of the transfer of technology with military applications .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Forty-three non-recurrent publications .  ( i ) Drug profiles based on the international drug abuse assessment system ( 40 ) ; ( ii ) resource book on measures to reduce illicit demand for drugs ; ( iii ) manual on techniques of rapid assessment of the extent of drug abuse problems ; and ( iv ) addendum to the Multilingual Dictionary of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances under International Control ;  
Parliamentary documentation .  ( i ) Four reports to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on the extent and developments in illicit traffic , with statistical and descriptive material , and analysis at the regional and global levels ; and ( ii ) contributions to the reports to regional meetings ( subsidiary bodies of the Commission ) on trends in illicit drug trafficking ;  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
In any case , the possibility of changing this criterion should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject , in the light of experiences where nationality has been used to mask the mercenary nature of illicit activities engaged in by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population .  
Tools prepared by UNDCP for the implementation of the conventions also included an annual directory listing national authorities competent to take action under specific articles of the conventions , such as article 7 ( on mutual legal assistance ) or article 17 ( on illicit traffic by sea ) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
The public was showing increasing concern regarding illicit trafficking ; it was noted that the press file prepared for the eighth session had doubled in size over the previous session , indicating that there had been a very great increase in public interest .  
At a recent meeting at the ministerial level held in London on 20 December 1994 , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Spain and the United Kingdom had confirmed their support for the process begun in Brussels , recognized the importance for Gibraltar of the establishment of a sustainable economy , and agreed to cooperate in combating the growing illicit trafficking in the Gibraltar area .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic or designer drugs , has expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
We continue to support the multifaceted activity of the Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials , enhancing the level of their physical protection , and preparing an international convention to deal with radioactive wastes .  
Acknowledging the need for an international instrument to deal with the problem of illicit payments in international business transactions , in particular the completion of the draft international agreement on illicit payments , so as to promote governmental accountability , a stable and predictable international business environment and fair economic and social development for the general public ,  
had decided to address themselves to the social and economic aspects of the scourge of drugs , to make reciprocal commitments that would lead to a significant and verifiable decline in consumption as well as a sharp reduction in supply , and to adopt energetic measures against money-laundering , distribution organizations , arms trafficking and illicit trafficking in chemical precursors .  
His delegation was happy to note that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , having identified the weaknesses in the Global Programme of Action aimed at combating drugs , had , during 1995 , adopted resolutions intended to create a cohesive strategy in that domain , enhance regional and international cooperation , particularly between customs authorities , and prevent the diversion of psychotropic substances for illicit purposes .  
the need for an international instrument to deal with the problem of illicit payments in international business transactions , in particular the completion of the draft international agreement on illicit payments , so as to promote governmental accountability , a stable and predictable international business environment and fair economic and social development for the general public ,  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of illicit arms trafficking .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
Also at the fourth ministerial meeting , South Africa and the member States emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation among member States of the zone , in law enforcement agencies and within the international and regional organizations in the fight against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
The second objective of the subprogramme is to assist governments to establish , maintain and strengthen national controls over the licit supply of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The third objective of the subprogramme is to manage the international system of control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors used for licit purposes in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
Working under the guidance of INCB , UNDCP and governments will ensure that narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors needed for medical , scientific and other licit purposes will continue to be available ; diversion of narcotic drugs from international trade into the illicit traffic will continue to be minimal ; and the level of diversion of psychotropic substances from international trade will decrease .  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
2 During the reporting period , the international community paid increased attention to the illicit traffic in , and abuse of , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , acknowledged to be a major threat to the fabric of society and the security of States .  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
Concerning cooperation in activities directed against organized crime , particularly crime related to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the Commission requested Member States to implement the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime , [ 1 ] adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime held at Naples , Italy , from 21 to 23 November 1994 , and subsequently approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 159 of 23 December 1994 .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
To achieve broad-based cooperation against drug trafficking by sea , Governments were invited to encourage commercial carriers and professional groups active in maritime transport to become involved in the fight against illicit drug traffic , on the basis of voluntary cooperation and memoranda of understanding at the national and international levels , as well as through training to increase the awareness of maritime transport personnel with regard to illicit drug trafficking .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
In accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 20 , the study covers a wide area , ranging from the licit to the illicit and from the bio-medical field to the economic , social , political and epidemiological fields .  
What began originally as a displacement from the licit to the illicit sector in a small number of key countries in east Asia , Europe and North America now shows every sign of diffusing beyond those original focal areas into neighbouring ones .  
The adoption of the 1988 Convention not only marked the first decisive step in mobilizing the international community in the fight against illicit drug trafficking , but also defined money-laundering offences and required parties to the Convention to proscribe them as serious criminal offences that would be severely punished and subject to extradition .  
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
Some of the perceived potential benefits include pleasure derived directly from the psychopharmacological effects of the drug ; pleasure derived indirectly through the perceived improved performance of the individual in different contexts ; the thrill of indulging in " risky " behaviour ; and the social benefits that may be derived from being associated with a group or subculture in which illicit drugs are consumed .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
In addition , prenatal exposure to illicit drugs and factors such as premature birth , low birth weight and poor relations between the child and care-giver in early childhood have been identified as problematic in relation to later development and , consequently , as precursors of the risk factors listed in the table above .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .  
The idea of elaborating an international convention on the illicit traffic in children needed to be discussed further , taking due account of existing conventions in that specific area , which already provided a comprehensive legal framework ( for example , the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children , concluded at Geneva on 30 September 1921 , as amended by the Protocol signed at Lake Success , New York , on 12 November 1947 ) .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
To establish , maintain and strengthen national and international controls over licit supplies of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors in a manner that ensures adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes while preventing diversion to illicit channels .  
To that end , the inventory of effective strategies , approaches , projects and programmes to reduce illicit demand and supply maintained by the Programme will be improved and expanded , and effective countermeasures tailored to local conditions against drug abuse , cultivation of illicit crops and drug trafficking will be developed .  
To that end , the concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
The recommendations cover , inter alia , ensuring that the burden of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds or other property liable to confiscation ; concluding agreements with other Governments on the sharing of confiscated illicit proceeds in order to promote the willingness of Governments to investigate and share information on money-laundering activities ; and contributing at least part of the value of confiscated proceeds and property to governmental and intergovernmental bodies that specialize in the fight against illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
In chapter II of its report , the Board places particular emphasis on the sharp and controversial increase in the use of methylphenidate , better known under its trade name Ritalin , in the treatment of attention deficit disorder ; the abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular " ecstasy " and " ice " ; the diversion of psychotropic substances , in particular benzodiazepines , from domestic and international distribution channels ; and the illicit traffic and diversion of acetic anhydride to clandestine drug laboratories .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
The fifth objective is to facilitate appropriate follow-up and complementary work to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme studies and research and analysis of the economic and social impact of drug production , trafficking and consumption , as well as formulations of alternative development programmes to remedy this impact , and to provide technical assistance in the formulation of national policies to prevent and reduce the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances . 
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
In 1995 , in close collaboration with the Palestinian Authority , the Programme prepared the project entitled " Multi-sectoral drug control assistance to the Palestinian Authority " , which will provide technical assistance ( a ) to establish a drug control institutional framework ; ( b ) to reduce the illicit supply of narcotic drugs through improved detection , interdiction and prosecution capacities ; and ( c ) to prevent and reduce drug abuse through improved awareness , treatment and rehabilitation methods .  
" To that end , in certain subregions , coordination of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to combat illicit trafficking of drugs and precursors will be improved , taking into account national priorities and in a continuous dialogue with the competent national authorities " .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Recognizing the efforts of countries which produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Renews its commitment to further strengthening international cooperation and substantially increasing efforts against the cultivation for illegal purposes , illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotics and psychotropic substances , including synthetic drugs , and to control and prevent the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic and psychotropic substances , in accordance with obligations of States under the United Nations drug control conventions , based on the principle of shared responsibility and taking into account experience gained ;  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 , and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
To taking effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursuing effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encouraging the adoption of laws for these purposes where they do not exist , and to calling upon private and public corporations and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,

Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;

Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Take steps to prevent and counteract , through appropriate domestic measures , the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations , whether such financing is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or claim to have charitable , social or cultural goals , or which are also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms trafficking , drug dealing and racketeering  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
A wide programme of eradication of coca plants , poppies and marijuana crops continued to be carried out , and continued efforts were being made to obtain additional resources through international cooperation to complement those already invested in the country 's alternative development programme , which constituted an economically sustainable solution for peasant and indigenous families , and a long-term solution for elimination of the illicit supply of drugs .  
The main difficulty in controlling illicit drugs was that well-organized , well-financed and closely-knit criminal cartels had flexible mechanisms , were capable of threatening entire States and did not hesitate to corrupt officials in order to reach their goals .  
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Under subprogramme 2 , analytical support will be provided to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and its subsidiary bodies through regular reports on trends and patterns in illicit drug production , trafficking and abuse and through other reports as requested , including those required in connection with the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1998 .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
The illicit traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes can assume various forms , the principal characteristic being the ability of the persons engaged therein to adapt to the changing international situation .  
The ban on the export of hazardous products , including those intended for recycling , which has now been imposed by the Basel Convention would remain a dead letter if it were not accompanied by practical measures for the detection of illicit practices .  This can be achieved only by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
In welcoming the participants , he emphasized the growing threat posed by organized transnational crime in all its insidious forms , including theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene , for three days in June 1998 , a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
Several Governments have reported efforts to eradicate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants , and countries in which such illicit cultivation remains a problem have sought international assistance through bilateral or multilateral agreements to implement alternative development programmes .  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
It also invited all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardized the friendly relations among States , hindered development of international cooperation and resulted in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Finally , all States of the region are invited to address , through various forms of cooperation , terrorism , international crime and illicit drug production and trafficking , as factors jeopardizing friendly relations between States , hindering the development of international cooperation , and , above all , resulting in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
On the question of international drug control , he said that , in the light of the unprecedented spread of illicit drugs over the past two decades , the relevant international instruments must be implemented and the role of the United Nations must be enhanced . 
While making steady advances in economic and social development , China was also undertaking tremendous efforts in drug control through strengthened law enforcement and control of domestic narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , and chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;

At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities " .  
The Parties have agreed to cooperate actively in combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the smuggling of weapons and ammunition and of explosive , toxic and radioactive materials , organized crime , illegal migration and terrorism .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
In this connection , I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in October 1996 my country 's Parliament , at the initiative of the Executive , adopted a law that establishes norms and punishments for the crime of laundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in narcotics , psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs , thereby significantly improving the legal framework for combating such crimes head on .  
With the appointment of regional alternative development advisers posted in south and south-east Asia and Latin America and strengthened expertise in alternative development at headquarters , UNDCP has underlined its commitment to supporting alternative development as a viable tool for reducing illicit crop cultivation .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to conduct a survey , on the basis of existing international conventions , analysing the extent to which children were protected from becoming victims of illicit international trafficking , taking into account both substantive and procedural aspects of providing such protection , and to compile and analyse the data collected .  
This analysis is considered a starting point and focuses on two main elements : ( a ) global interception rates at a time of expansion of international trade and transportation and improved illicit drug trafficking methods ; and ( b ) law enforcement approaches applied in order to improve interception rates and their range of application in selected key trafficking regions .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
It requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of the phenomena and to include in her next report information on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit traffic , as well as information on persons killed , maimed or injured in developing countries through this heinous act .  
In addition , Austria made reference to the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement , which Austria has signed but not yet ratified , under which measures of cross-frontier observation and prosecution are only admissible if one of the listed offences has been committed , which also included the " illicit trade in poisonous and harmful substances " .  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
The central themes of the discussions were the following : the promotion of cooperation in law enforcement and the exchange of information on drug traffickers ; harmonization of various bilateral , multilateral and regional approaches to controlling substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the legislative frameworks , so as to facilitate the worldwide exchange of information on suspicious transactions involving such substances ; and the eradication of illicit crops and the development of programmes to advance crop substitution and alternative development projects .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
As the illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are serious and growing concerns in the region , the development of an accurate annual estimate of the situation and trends is essential to the successful development and implementation of regional strategies and subregional programmes .  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
In particular , it was assisting the national commission to combat illicit drug use in its coordination activities and had amended its organic law on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1993 to make it more compatible with the multilateral mechanisms in existence .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
To tackle illicit cultivation in Afghanistan effectively and to sever trafficking routes flowing from that country will require a major - and sustained - investment by the international community coupled with the commitment of local authorities to enforce a ban on opium poppy cultivation as a condition of participation in alternative development activities .  
In central and eastern Europe , UNDCP will support further development of the Subregional Drug Control Cooperation Programme on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed at Prague in 1995 , initiated to provide a comprehensive response to drug-control challenges posed by east-west and south-north illicit trafficking and growing drug abuse .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
At the end of the biennium , it is envisaged that in the key States parties to the memorandum of understanding , and in which national and subregional drug-control efforts are pursued , effective drug-control coordination and legislation will have taken hold , illicit opium poppy cultivation in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic , Myanmar and Viet Nam will be noticeably reduced , effective control measures against trafficking will be in place and prevention and reduction of drug abuse will have received more vigorous efforts by the national authorities and civil societies alike .  
Furthermore , it is expected that in Bolivia , Colombia and Peru , national alternative development agencies will be in place capable of coordinating and channelling effectively all relevant national and international resources aimed at creating the conditions for the elimination of coca crops , wherever these are illicit or known to feed the cocaine industry .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
There are no regular standards established to gauge the informal economy , which has increased in all countries , and the illegal or illicit economy , which is based not only on drugs , but on contraband , arms and other categories .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
Recognizing the serious threat posed by illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances to people 's health and well-being , and its negative impact on the economic , cultural and moral foundations of society ,  
The statement in the World Drug Report that the trade in illicit drugs represented approximately 8 per cent of total international trade and constituted one of the most profitable ways of becoming wealthy , was alarming .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative to an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative for an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The aim of the latter project is to publish a world report on organized crime every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall27 establish as criminal offences28 the following conduct :  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
Working mechanisms and standard operating procedures between competent national and international bodies established with a view to preventing and detecting diversion of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into illicit traffic ;  
The Programme is playing a catalytic role in the development of a comprehensive and reliable international monitoring mechanism , including the development of a scientifically sound yield assessment methodology and the determination of yield figures for selected countries to guide and assess the progress of measures implemented by the international community to eliminate or significantly reduce the illicit cultivation of cannabis , coca and opium poppy by the year 2008 .  
The concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Emphasizes that mediation and restorative justice measures can lead to satisfaction for victims as well as to the prevention of future illicit behaviour and can represent a viable alternative to short terms of imprisonment and to fines , which are in certain cases practically impossible to collect ;  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall29 establish as criminal offences30 the following conduct :  
Lastly , the two parties expressed satisfaction that the negotiation and signature of important draft agreements on tourism , cooperation in combating illicit traffic and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , and cooperation and mutual assistance in combating illegal financial operations had reached an advanced stage .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Being conscious of the international dimension of the illegal flow of armaments , Georgia stands ready to contribute to the multilateral efforts and to cooperate in negotiating effective instruments to this end , in particular , a global convention on illicit arms trafficking .  
Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , psycho _ social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
The Group recommends that the study on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States , requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of resolution 53 / 77 E , should be completed in time for it to be considered at the international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , to be convened no later than 2001 .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
Any decision on the venue of the international conference on the illicit arms trade must take into account the need to ensure the most advantageous financial conditions for the participants in the conference ; a broad geographical spectrum of participating countries ; maximum effectiveness of the work of the conference ; and the necessary security guarantees for delegations .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The conference , for this purpose , should consider the main factors leading and contributing to the excessive accumulation of small arms and may adopt a plan of action consisting of specific coordinated efforts by the international community to reduce and prevent illicit trafficking as well as to face and resolve the problems associated with the excessive accumulation of small arms .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
The Agency also reported that a new technical cooperation project had been initiated , entitled Physical Protection and Security of Nuclear Materials , designed to increase the national capacity in countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials , as well as for the prevention of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials .  
The Council requested the OAU secretariat to organize a preparatory conference of continental experts on the matter , prior to the convening of the United Nations international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , and to seek the support of relevant United Nations agencies and other actors concerned , so as to evolve a common approach for Africa .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
The Buenos Aires seminar represented a first initiative undertaken in cooperation with the Department for Disarmament Affairs pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 T , in which the Secretary-General is requested to hold broad-based consultations on illicit trafficking in small arms , taking into account the ongoing work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms , with all Member States , interested regional and subregional organizations , international agencies and experts .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
UNDCP is playing a catalytic role in providing the strategy for achieving this goal , in close cooperation with national and international partners and international financial institutions engaged in poverty eradication , health and education to improve the overall quality of life in areas affected by illicit cultivation of narcotic crops , thereby reducing incentives for the cultivation of illicit crops .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
The enormous financial gains from illicit transactions , the abundant availability of small arms and the most sophisticated weaponry alike , as well as easy access to technology all help to create an ever more dangerous type of terrorist .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;

Each State Party shall29 establish as criminal offences30 the following conduct :  
Under the authority of the national committee on the use of illicit drugs , the relevant national institutions had focused their activities on human resource development , scientific research , periodic evaluation and the provision of services to the most vulnerable sectors of society , including young people .  
As far as verification was concerned , the international community should support the UNDCP initiative on the establishment of an independent , neutral and objective global monitoring system to enable States to measure the extent of illicit cultivation on their territory and to take the appropriate measures .  
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add , including public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
Situated on the crossroads between the east and the west , the north and the south of the continent , Belarus will be further contributing to international cooperation in combating transborder crime , terrorism and illicit drug trafficking .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
In effect States should undertake additional measures , such as stepping up efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines , combating the excessive stockpiling and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , addressing the fate of children involved in armed conflicts , protecting and assisting internally displaced people and ensuring the rapid entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court .  
It is for this reason that the ongoing illicit trafficking in and the systematic plundering of its works of art are harmful not only to the countries that own these works of art and archaeological treasures , but also to universal culture and human civilization .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
In the press release she published herself on 19 June , at the end of her visit , the Special Rapporteur endorsed this appeal and emphasized the vital nature of preventive action at national , regional and international level to halt the illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which seriously threatened the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
It is also important that in the region of north and south America a reliable information and data network be set up which would make it possible to establish a warning system to prevent illicit trafficking and to coordinate action to counter and curb such trafficking , including the tracing of networks and organized rings .  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
Pass and enforce necessary anti-corruption laws on campaign financing ; independence of supreme audit bodies ; freedom of information ; conflict of interest ; freedom of the media and freedom of expression ; protection of whistle-blowers and witnesses ; shifting the burden of proof regarding confiscation of illicit enrichment ; decreasing the discretionary powers of the executive ; amnesty ; and investigative powers to conduct integrity tests or other investigative measures ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In fifth place , as regards general disarmament , we emphasize the need to advance towards total elimination of nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons ; illicit trafficking in small arms , and the use of antipersonnel mines and explosive devices .  
It is a paradox that some rich countries have such lax laws that they provide safe havens and encourage private banks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons from poor countries by facilitating the establishment of secret accounts .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
Only through concerted and collective action on the part of the entire international community can we combat phenomena such as severe financial and economic crises , regional conflicts , international terrorism , organized crime and the illicit drug trade .  
To come together in order to counter the evil role played by diamonds in armed conflict is an excellent , irreproachable initiative , because this illicit trade is prejudicial to peace , particularly in Africa .  
This illicit and inhumane business is of a complex and transnational nature , and the wide range of organized crime that it creates is disrupting normal life in eastern Iran and adversely affecting the rest of the country .  
A large number of these illegal immigrants are linked to organized international crime and terrorism , narcomafia , illicit trade in arms , human smuggling , juvenile crime and prostitution and are responsible for the criminalization of Kosovo and Metohija .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
His Government acknowledged the need for adequate and effective measures to interdict illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials and believed that new and more comprehensive cooperative efforts might be required .  
They stressed the special importance of cooperation in alternative development , including the better integration of the most vulnerable sectors involved in the illicit drug market into legal and viable economic activities .  
If the political will is summoned to deny the ability of warring factions to sustain their illicit trade in natural resources , a vital lifeline that supports and sustains armed conflict will be degraded , if not destroyed .  
In recent years , the grave threat posed by small arms especially by the illicit manufacture of and trafficking and trade in small arms to social development , civilian safety and regional security has become a common concern of the international community .  
Residual effects of regional conflicts and of the tension that marked the cold war have led to an unprecedented increase in the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , whose intended recipients are mainly developing countries .  
The international community has unequivocally condemned and rejected the Talibans ideological orientations , which have been responsible for the Taliban territories emerging as the worlds principal centre of international terrorism , illicit drugs and violation of human rights , principally those of women .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
The consequences of war , acts of genocide , armed conflicts , family violence , international terrorism , organized crime , and trafficking in humans and drugs , as well as weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , have devastating consequences for children and a profound impact on their lives and their communities .  
Determined to alleviate the plight of populations in the regions of the world besieged by armed conflicts and criminality , which are fuelled by illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , in a manner that would bring the benefits of social and economic development and national , regional and international stability ,  
Objective : To strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Governments in tackling crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems .  
Gravely concerned with the illicit manufacturing , stockpiling of , trafficking in , possession and use of firearms and , especially , those used in the commission of violent crimes and their contribution to the high level of instability , prolonged conflict and social dislocation that is evident in southern Africa and the African continent as a whole ,  
With regard to the use of non-controlled substitute chemicals in the illicit manufacture of drugs , the substances and guidelines included in the limited international special surveillance list established by the Board were a useful tool for Governments , promoting awareness and cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion of those substances .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Urges Governments and regional organizations to make use of the limited international special surveillance list of substances established by the Board , adapted or supplemented , where appropriate , by lists of chemicals subject to voluntary monitoring , to reflect national and regional situations and changing trends in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
Draws the attention of all States to the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , 2 signed at the High-level Political Signing Conference held in Palermo , Italy , from 12 to 15 December 2000 , and of the protocols thereto , 3 , 4 which strengthen the countermeasures against transnational organized crime by , inter alia , providing a concrete basis for international cooperation and for effective law enforcement action to deal in an integrated manner with all interrelated aspects of illicit trafficking ;  
In view of the alarming increase in the illicit manufacture , trafficking and abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS , UNDCP was called upon to give higher priority to supporting Governments to counter the problem posed by those substances at the global level .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,  
In this context it is important to differentiate between piracy , which is an international crime under international law and can only be committed on the high seas and in the exclusive economic zone , and any other illicit acts or criminal actions committed within the jurisdiction of a State , which are therefore punishable under national law .  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed . 
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
However , in some areas , by exploiting existing legislative and administrative gaps and unregulated grey areas , they facilitate illicit deals in violation of international norms and national laws and regulations governing these activities .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;

Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
States are encouraged , subject to their national practices , to enhance , according to their respective constitutional and legal systems , mutual legal assistance and other forms of cooperation in order to assist investigations and prosecutions in relation to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
As individuals and States alike bear the grave consequences of terror and organized crime , which are fuelled and aided by illicit trafficking in small arms , ammunition and explosives , the efforts of the international community are both urgent and vital .  
The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
However , deregulation without accompanying measures , such as the establishment of professional bodies ( haulier associations ) to set professional standards and maintain discipline among members , could create a vacuum which could be exploited by unscrupulous operators engaging in illicit or illegal practices .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
Among such steps are the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards , revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material , improving national standards of security and physical protection of nuclear material , establishing stronger regulatory control over radioactive sources and enhancing international cooperation against illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
The Institute , in partnership with subregional groupings of member States and in close cooperation with certain concerned civil society organizations , has been involved in implementing subregional initiatives and priorities undertaken towards responding to vital national security concerns and finding practical solutions and support with respect to the problem of illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
My delegation believes that security is a subject that is not linked to international peace and security alone , but encompasses a series of elements within a multisectoral framework that , in addition to security , includes the commitment to promote democracy and full respect for human rights , to battle crime and illicit drugs , and to foster overall social and economic development in a harmonious way .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
The international community must develop and improve efforts to integrate the most vulnerable social sectors involved in the illicit drug trade through legal and viable economic activities .  
Relying on social strengths , resorting to legal , administrative , economic and educational means , and adopting a holistic approach were all effective ways to tackle the problem of illicit drugs .  
International efforts in response to that threat , particularly those agreed on at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , reflected widespread awareness of the need to take global , integrated action to reduce drug abuse and eliminate illicit trafficking .  
Such measures are , inter alia , collection and responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered ; confidence-building measures ; disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants ; demining ; and conversion ,  
As a primary sponsor of that draft resolution , South Africa is particularly pleased that the Secretariat managed to source from existing budgetary provisions adequate funding for the conference servicing required for the first biennial meeting of States contemplated in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution , as well as for the meetings of a group of experts to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument for tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , referred to in paragraph 10 .  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
Noting also that the problem of corrupt practices and the transfer of funds of illicit origin , as well as the need to prevent the transfer of and to return such funds , have social , economic and legal implications that require comprehensive , holistic examination at the national and international levels ,  
Noting also that the problem of corrupt practices and the transfer of funds of illicit origin , as well as the need to prevent the transfer of such funds , and to return them , have social , economic and legal implications that require comprehensive , holistic examination at the national and international levels ,  
The expansion of global knowledge of and expertise to deal with crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money-laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems ;  
Strengthening or developing agreed norms and measures at the global , regional and national levels that would reinforce and further coordinate efforts to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ;  
Systematic or methodical illicit enrichment of a public official of unlawful financial proceeds obtained through a series or combination of corrupt acts as defined in articles [ . . . ] of this Convention , penalties for which may vary according to the gravity of the offence , and as may be determined by the participating States ;  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination mechanisms for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ; Article 18 .  
Etienne Clement , the director of UNESCO office in Cambodia , said the problem of massive looting and trafficking of underground heritages started about five years ago , when the Cambodian government successfully cracked down on illicit trafficking of stone statuary from famous temples , so heritage traffickers have began to smuggle " less spectacular ordinary antiquities . "  
Article 40 For the enterprise responsible for printing the renminbi and relevant personnel that have one of the following conditions , the People 's Bank of China will issue a warning , confiscate their profits obtained illegally , and impose on them a fine equivalent to between one and three times the value of the obtained illegal profits .  Those that do not have illicit gains will be fined between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
In 1999 , they carried out 24,169 law-enforcement supervision projects .  As a result , illicit funds totaling 76.1-billion yuan and 20,384 clues to cases were discovered , 14,572 cases were registered for investigation , 4,939 persons were punished according to administrative disciplinary action , 1,462 persons were transferred to judicial organs for handling , and 8,070 suggestions were offered to improve work , thus averting and retrieving economic losses totaling 137.6-billion yuan .  
According to a preliminary police investigation , Liu Qijun 's criminal gang was involved in a total of 14 criminal cases including killing , robbery , rape , illicit possession of firearms , arson , compulsory business dealings , crimes of affray , and hindrance of official duties .  As a result of the crimes committed by the gang , two people died , five people received serious injuries , and more than 20 people suffered light injuries .  
The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
When headed by Vice Mayor Wang , the city government housing bureau was found to have violated the rules and developed unwanted houses in Meilin First Village and many other projects , thus sparking protests from several hundred home buyers , who were civil servants .  It was understood that the civil servants were unhappy with the housing bureau 's illicit transfer of some projects to Wang Ju 's son .  
The department for foreign trade and economic affairs must earnestly carry out its works well in examining and approving applications from the processing industry to process electronic game equipment and its parts and accessories and overseeing the re-export of the processed equipment , parts , and accessories out of the country .  It must coordinate with the customs houses to crack down on illicit activities in smuggling electronic game equipment , parts and accessories .  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .  To this end , the five countries will draw up relevant multilateral outlines as early as possible ;  
The 44th session of the IAEA General Conference , which started on 18 September , will review the IAEA 's 1999 annual report , as well as reports on stepping up international cooperation in nuclear safety , radiation safety , and radioactive waste safety , on intensifying the IAEA 's technological cooperation , and on preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials . 
This reporter has learned from an anticorruption and anti-bribery work conference held by Guangdong Province 's procuratorial organs the other day that this year , Guangdong Province has investigated and punished in accordance with the law a total of 172 cadres at and above county or department level and procuratorial organs concerned have seized or recovered through investigating such cases illicit cash or goods totaling more than 100 million yuan .  
As the principal responsible person of a local party committee , he abandoned the proper political responsibility of a leading cadre , discarded the principles of party spirit , became a crony of an illicit foreign businessman , went in for bartering power for money in a big way , led a number of cadres astray , damaged the party style and social atmosphere , ruined the party 's image , and damaged state interests , causing serious consequences to local economic and social development .  
The commission will deliberate preparations for the special session of the General Assembly to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international co-operation in addressing the problem of drug abuse and illicit trafficking .  
A Government spokesman said today ( Monday ) that the Dutiable Commodities ( Amendment ) Bill 1999 ( " the Bill " ) would be introduced to address two major practical difficulties encountered by C &amp; amp ; ED in taking prosecution action under such prohibitive provisions .  One lies in proving the supply of certain illicit fuel , while the other relates to proving the use of detreated oil ( oil with its chemical marker illegally removed ) or dutiable light diesel oil as fuel by vehicles .  
In response to a recent misleading agency report alleging that western criminals were laundering illicit money through the underground banking systems in Asian economies such as Hong Kong , the Commissioner for Narcotics , Mrs . Clarie Lo , said today ( Monday ) , " Hong Kong has all the necessary measures in place , including an ever improving legislative regime and strong enforcement actions , to counter money laundering .  
The TTF will focus its checks with the aid of intelligence and information gathered about the illegal importing and exporting patterns of certain illicit textile traders .  Any suspicious consignments and traders would be identified and appropriate measures will then be taken by the TTF or other investigative bureaux of the department .  This may include close surveillance on the activities of these illicit traders and transportation companies .  
" The presumption is reasonable because illicit fuel usually has a sulphur content higher than 0.05% by weight whereas light diesel oil from legitimate sources on which duty has been paid must have a sulphur content at or below 0.05% .  This is because the supply for vehicular use of light diesel oil with a sulphur content higher than 0.05% is prohibited under the Air Pollution Control ( Motor Vehicle Fuel ) Regulations .  
" The reversal in the crime trend is in large a result of measure taken under the CCB 's approach which led to successful prosecutions of cases handled by the Bureau , sending a warning to those who consider engaging in the illicit trade .  " In addition to enhanced sentences for prevalent offence under the OSCO , companies with dubious or allegedly uttered accounts may be required to produce material concerning their business upon the issue of an order under section 4 of the same ordinance , " the spokesman said .  
( c ) With the support of the Committee on the Promotion of Civic Education and the Commission on Youth , the Administration has been actively promoting civic awareness , social responsibility and positive values among the public , particularly young people , through various publicity channels , educational programmes and funding schemes .  The objective is to help nurture good citizenship and reduce the possibility of young people engaging in illicit activities .  
Mr Lo said : " The earlier conflicts of interests in Yuen Long have led to a series of violent acts by the two triad societies including wounding , criminal damage and arson which seriously endangered the life of the residents .  Thus , the Police planned an operation targeting the illicit activities of these two triad gangs and implemented the operation codenamed Mullington in late June with a view to dealing a blow on the gangs . "  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
In an unexpected development in this connection , to escape debt obligations a major shareholder in a venture-capital firm who has close ties with the ruling DPP has alleged the existence of a complex network of interlocking party and business funds involving illicit kickbacks to members of several different parties .  
States should review their domestic arrangements for the regulation and control of licit supplies of drugs , especially psychotropic substances , to ensure the satisfaction of legitimate and justified medical requirements and prevent illicit supply .  
States have made considerable progress in concluding bilateral , regional or multilateral agreements aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
To this precarious picture we must add the resurgence of social problems , such as juvenile delinquency , illicit trade in drugs and narcotics , unemployment , the AIDS pandemic and the deleterious effects of persistent drought and other natural disasters .  
Effective action at the global level was crucial in preventing and controlling the accumulation of illicit profits and in contributing to the impoverishment and weakening of criminal organizations .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
There has also been a holistic review of the current and future potential of remotely sensed data ( satellite and airborne ) for identification and monitoring of illicit crops ( that is , opium poppy , cannabis and coca ) .  
However , the international transfer of conventional arms as well as the increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking , have in recent decades acquired a dimension and qualitative characteristics that give rise to serious and urgent concerns .  
States continued to make progress in concluding bilateral , regional or multilateral agreements aimed at suppressing illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
Ecuador maintained its unwavering commitment to the joint development and use of mechanisms to combat illicit drug trafficking and had ratified numerous regional and international legal instruments relating to drugs .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of the illicit arms trade ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) .  
By its resolution 46 / 36 H , entitled " International arms transfers " , the General Assembly , inter alia , called upon all States to give high priority to eradicating the illicit trade in all kinds of weapons and military equipment , a most disturbing and dangerous phenomenon often associated with terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime and mercenary and other destabilizing activities , and to take urgent action towards that end , as recommended in the study submitted by the Secretary-General .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
Since national legislation varies from country to country and , in practice , the borderline between licit and illicit arms transfers may not always be apparent , measures conducive to [ harmonizing ] [ achieving common ] laws and / or regulations and procedures , [ as well as the means of enforcing them , ] should be developed at the international level to ensure effective control over the acquisition and transfer of weapons .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
The economic importance of this illicit trafficking , which continues at an increasing pace , is reflected in the following data : in 1993 tobacco smuggling represented , in conservative terms , nearly 20 per cent of the colony 's gross domestic product , and in 1995 the value of drugs brought into Spain from Gibraltar without being seized exceeded 200-billion pesetas , which is equivalent to $ 1.6-billion .  
The international community therefore has a special responsibility to check and curb these illicit arms transfers as a matter of the highest priority , as terrorism has emerged as the principal public enemy , often transcending national boundaries and threatening to tear apart the very fabric of civil society . 
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , in countries affected by the illicit drug problem , that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
It included , among others , an effective exchange of operative data and information , joint actions in intercepting the organized international traffic routes and many seminars abroad , which Yugoslav experts used to brush up their knowledge in the field of the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs .  
Discussion at the United Nations focused on issues such as limitations on conventional weapons ; transparency in international arms transfers and arms production ; curbing the illicit traffic in conventional arms ; transparency in military expenditures ; inhumane weapons and the Convention restricting their use ; and , recently , regulation of the transfer of technology with military applications .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Forty-three non-recurrent publications .  ( i ) Drug profiles based on the international drug abuse assessment system ( 40 ) ; ( ii ) resource book on measures to reduce illicit demand for drugs ; ( iii ) manual on techniques of rapid assessment of the extent of drug abuse problems ; and ( iv ) addendum to the Multilingual Dictionary of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances under International Control ;  
Parliamentary documentation .  ( i ) Four reports to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on the extent and developments in illicit traffic , with statistical and descriptive material , and analysis at the regional and global levels ; and ( ii ) contributions to the reports to regional meetings ( subsidiary bodies of the Commission ) on trends in illicit drug trafficking ;  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
In any case , the possibility of changing this criterion should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject , in the light of experiences where nationality has been used to mask the mercenary nature of illicit activities engaged in by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population .  
Tools prepared by UNDCP for the implementation of the conventions also included an annual directory listing national authorities competent to take action under specific articles of the conventions , such as article 7 ( on mutual legal assistance ) or article 17 ( on illicit traffic by sea ) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
The public was showing increasing concern regarding illicit trafficking ; it was noted that the press file prepared for the eighth session had doubled in size over the previous session , indicating that there had been a very great increase in public interest .  
At a recent meeting at the ministerial level held in London on 20 December 1994 , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Spain and the United Kingdom had confirmed their support for the process begun in Brussels , recognized the importance for Gibraltar of the establishment of a sustainable economy , and agreed to cooperate in combating the growing illicit trafficking in the Gibraltar area .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic or designer drugs , has expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
We continue to support the multifaceted activity of the Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials , enhancing the level of their physical protection , and preparing an international convention to deal with radioactive wastes .  
Acknowledging the need for an international instrument to deal with the problem of illicit payments in international business transactions , in particular the completion of the draft international agreement on illicit payments , so as to promote governmental accountability , a stable and predictable international business environment and fair economic and social development for the general public ,  
had decided to address themselves to the social and economic aspects of the scourge of drugs , to make reciprocal commitments that would lead to a significant and verifiable decline in consumption as well as a sharp reduction in supply , and to adopt energetic measures against money-laundering , distribution organizations , arms trafficking and illicit trafficking in chemical precursors .  
His delegation was happy to note that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , having identified the weaknesses in the Global Programme of Action aimed at combating drugs , had , during 1995 , adopted resolutions intended to create a cohesive strategy in that domain , enhance regional and international cooperation , particularly between customs authorities , and prevent the diversion of psychotropic substances for illicit purposes .  
the need for an international instrument to deal with the problem of illicit payments in international business transactions , in particular the completion of the draft international agreement on illicit payments , so as to promote governmental accountability , a stable and predictable international business environment and fair economic and social development for the general public ,  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of illicit arms trafficking .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
Also at the fourth ministerial meeting , South Africa and the member States emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation among member States of the zone , in law enforcement agencies and within the international and regional organizations in the fight against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
The second objective of the subprogramme is to assist governments to establish , maintain and strengthen national controls over the licit supply of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
The third objective of the subprogramme is to manage the international system of control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors used for licit purposes in a manner which prevents diversion to illicit channels while ensuring adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes .  
Working under the guidance of INCB , UNDCP and governments will ensure that narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors needed for medical , scientific and other licit purposes will continue to be available ; diversion of narcotic drugs from international trade into the illicit traffic will continue to be minimal ; and the level of diversion of psychotropic substances from international trade will decrease .  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
2 During the reporting period , the international community paid increased attention to the illicit traffic in , and abuse of , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , acknowledged to be a major threat to the fabric of society and the security of States .  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
Concerning cooperation in activities directed against organized crime , particularly crime related to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the Commission requested Member States to implement the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime , [ 1 ] adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime held at Naples , Italy , from 21 to 23 November 1994 , and subsequently approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 159 of 23 December 1994 .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
To achieve broad-based cooperation against drug trafficking by sea , Governments were invited to encourage commercial carriers and professional groups active in maritime transport to become involved in the fight against illicit drug traffic , on the basis of voluntary cooperation and memoranda of understanding at the national and international levels , as well as through training to increase the awareness of maritime transport personnel with regard to illicit drug trafficking .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
In accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 20 , the study covers a wide area , ranging from the licit to the illicit and from the bio-medical field to the economic , social , political and epidemiological fields .  
What began originally as a displacement from the licit to the illicit sector in a small number of key countries in east Asia , Europe and North America now shows every sign of diffusing beyond those original focal areas into neighbouring ones .  
The adoption of the 1988 Convention not only marked the first decisive step in mobilizing the international community in the fight against illicit drug trafficking , but also defined money-laundering offences and required parties to the Convention to proscribe them as serious criminal offences that would be severely punished and subject to extradition .  
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
Some of the perceived potential benefits include pleasure derived directly from the psychopharmacological effects of the drug ; pleasure derived indirectly through the perceived improved performance of the individual in different contexts ; the thrill of indulging in " risky " behaviour ; and the social benefits that may be derived from being associated with a group or subculture in which illicit drugs are consumed .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
In addition , prenatal exposure to illicit drugs and factors such as premature birth , low birth weight and poor relations between the child and care-giver in early childhood have been identified as problematic in relation to later development and , consequently , as precursors of the risk factors listed in the table above .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .  
The idea of elaborating an international convention on the illicit traffic in children needed to be discussed further , taking due account of existing conventions in that specific area , which already provided a comprehensive legal framework ( for example , the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children , concluded at Geneva on 30 September 1921 , as amended by the Protocol signed at Lake Success , New York , on 12 November 1947 ) .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
To establish , maintain and strengthen national and international controls over licit supplies of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors in a manner that ensures adequate availability for medical , scientific and other licit purposes while preventing diversion to illicit channels .  
To that end , the inventory of effective strategies , approaches , projects and programmes to reduce illicit demand and supply maintained by the Programme will be improved and expanded , and effective countermeasures tailored to local conditions against drug abuse , cultivation of illicit crops and drug trafficking will be developed .  
To that end , the concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
The recommendations cover , inter alia , ensuring that the burden of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds or other property liable to confiscation ; concluding agreements with other Governments on the sharing of confiscated illicit proceeds in order to promote the willingness of Governments to investigate and share information on money-laundering activities ; and contributing at least part of the value of confiscated proceeds and property to governmental and intergovernmental bodies that specialize in the fight against illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
In chapter II of its report , the Board places particular emphasis on the sharp and controversial increase in the use of methylphenidate , better known under its trade name Ritalin , in the treatment of attention deficit disorder ; the abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular " ecstasy " and " ice " ; the diversion of psychotropic substances , in particular benzodiazepines , from domestic and international distribution channels ; and the illicit traffic and diversion of acetic anhydride to clandestine drug laboratories .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
The fifth objective is to facilitate appropriate follow-up and complementary work to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme studies and research and analysis of the economic and social impact of drug production , trafficking and consumption , as well as formulations of alternative development programmes to remedy this impact , and to provide technical assistance in the formulation of national policies to prevent and reduce the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances . 
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
In 1995 , in close collaboration with the Palestinian Authority , the Programme prepared the project entitled " Multi-sectoral drug control assistance to the Palestinian Authority " , which will provide technical assistance ( a ) to establish a drug control institutional framework ; ( b ) to reduce the illicit supply of narcotic drugs through improved detection , interdiction and prosecution capacities ; and ( c ) to prevent and reduce drug abuse through improved awareness , treatment and rehabilitation methods .  
" To that end , in certain subregions , coordination of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to combat illicit trafficking of drugs and precursors will be improved , taking into account national priorities and in a continuous dialogue with the competent national authorities " .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Recognizing the efforts of countries which produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Renews its commitment to further strengthening international cooperation and substantially increasing efforts against the cultivation for illegal purposes , illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotics and psychotropic substances , including synthetic drugs , and to control and prevent the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic and psychotropic substances , in accordance with obligations of States under the United Nations drug control conventions , based on the principle of shared responsibility and taking into account experience gained ;  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 , and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
To taking effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursuing effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encouraging the adoption of laws for these purposes where they do not exist , and to calling upon private and public corporations and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Take steps to prevent and counteract , through appropriate domestic measures , the financing of terrorists and terrorist organizations , whether such financing is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or claim to have charitable , social or cultural goals , or which are also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms trafficking , drug dealing and racketeering  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
A wide programme of eradication of coca plants , poppies and marijuana crops continued to be carried out , and continued efforts were being made to obtain additional resources through international cooperation to complement those already invested in the country 's alternative development programme , which constituted an economically sustainable solution for peasant and indigenous families , and a long-term solution for elimination of the illicit supply of drugs .  
The main difficulty in controlling illicit drugs was that well-organized , well-financed and closely-knit criminal cartels had flexible mechanisms , were capable of threatening entire States and did not hesitate to corrupt officials in order to reach their goals .  
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Under subprogramme 2 , analytical support will be provided to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and its subsidiary bodies through regular reports on trends and patterns in illicit drug production , trafficking and abuse and through other reports as requested , including those required in connection with the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1998 .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
The illicit traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes can assume various forms , the principal characteristic being the ability of the persons engaged therein to adapt to the changing international situation .  
The ban on the export of hazardous products , including those intended for recycling , which has now been imposed by the Basel Convention would remain a dead letter if it were not accompanied by practical measures for the detection of illicit practices .  This can be achieved only by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
In welcoming the participants , he emphasized the growing threat posed by organized transnational crime in all its insidious forms , including theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene , for three days in June 1998 , a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
Several Governments have reported efforts to eradicate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants , and countries in which such illicit cultivation remains a problem have sought international assistance through bilateral or multilateral agreements to implement alternative development programmes .  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
It also invited all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardized the friendly relations among States , hindered development of international cooperation and resulted in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Finally , all States of the region are invited to address , through various forms of cooperation , terrorism , international crime and illicit drug production and trafficking , as factors jeopardizing friendly relations between States , hindering the development of international cooperation , and , above all , resulting in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
On the question of international drug control , he said that , in the light of the unprecedented spread of illicit drugs over the past two decades , the relevant international instruments must be implemented and the role of the United Nations must be enhanced . 
While making steady advances in economic and social development , China was also undertaking tremendous efforts in drug control through strengthened law enforcement and control of domestic narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , and chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;

At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities " .  
The Parties have agreed to cooperate actively in combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the smuggling of weapons and ammunition and of explosive , toxic and radioactive materials , organized crime , illegal migration and terrorism .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
In this connection , I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in October 1996 my country 's Parliament , at the initiative of the Executive , adopted a law that establishes norms and punishments for the crime of laundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in narcotics , psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs , thereby significantly improving the legal framework for combating such crimes head on .  
With the appointment of regional alternative development advisers posted in south and south-east Asia and Latin America and strengthened expertise in alternative development at headquarters , UNDCP has underlined its commitment to supporting alternative development as a viable tool for reducing illicit crop cultivation .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to conduct a survey , on the basis of existing international conventions , analysing the extent to which children were protected from becoming victims of illicit international trafficking , taking into account both substantive and procedural aspects of providing such protection , and to compile and analyse the data collected .  
This analysis is considered a starting point and focuses on two main elements : ( a ) global interception rates at a time of expansion of international trade and transportation and improved illicit drug trafficking methods ; and ( b ) law enforcement approaches applied in order to improve interception rates and their range of application in selected key trafficking regions .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
It requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of the phenomena and to include in her next report information on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit traffic , as well as information on persons killed , maimed or injured in developing countries through this heinous act .  
In addition , Austria made reference to the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement , which Austria has signed but not yet ratified , under which measures of cross-frontier observation and prosecution are only admissible if one of the listed offences has been committed , which also included the " illicit trade in poisonous and harmful substances " .  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
The central themes of the discussions were the following : the promotion of cooperation in law enforcement and the exchange of information on drug traffickers ; harmonization of various bilateral , multilateral and regional approaches to controlling substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the legislative frameworks , so as to facilitate the worldwide exchange of information on suspicious transactions involving such substances ; and the eradication of illicit crops and the development of programmes to advance crop substitution and alternative development projects .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
As the illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are serious and growing concerns in the region , the development of an accurate annual estimate of the situation and trends is essential to the successful development and implementation of regional strategies and subregional programmes .  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
In particular , it was assisting the national commission to combat illicit drug use in its coordination activities and had amended its organic law on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1993 to make it more compatible with the multilateral mechanisms in existence .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
To tackle illicit cultivation in Afghanistan effectively and to sever trafficking routes flowing from that country will require a major - and sustained - investment by the international community coupled with the commitment of local authorities to enforce a ban on opium poppy cultivation as a condition of participation in alternative development activities .  
In central and eastern Europe , UNDCP will support further development of the Subregional Drug Control Cooperation Programme on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed at Prague in 1995 , initiated to provide a comprehensive response to drug-control challenges posed by east-west and south-north illicit trafficking and growing drug abuse .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
At the end of the biennium , it is envisaged that in the key States parties to the memorandum of understanding , and in which national and subregional drug-control efforts are pursued , effective drug-control coordination and legislation will have taken hold , illicit opium poppy cultivation in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic , Myanmar and Viet Nam will be noticeably reduced , effective control measures against trafficking will be in place and prevention and reduction of drug abuse will have received more vigorous efforts by the national authorities and civil societies alike .  
Furthermore , it is expected that in Bolivia , Colombia and Peru , national alternative development agencies will be in place capable of coordinating and channelling effectively all relevant national and international resources aimed at creating the conditions for the elimination of coca crops , wherever these are illicit or known to feed the cocaine industry .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
There are no regular standards established to gauge the informal economy , which has increased in all countries , and the illegal or illicit economy , which is based not only on drugs , but on contraband , arms and other categories .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
Recognizing the serious threat posed by illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances to people 's health and well-being , and its negative impact on the economic , cultural and moral foundations of society ,  
The statement in the World Drug Report that the trade in illicit drugs represented approximately 8 per cent of total international trade and constituted one of the most profitable ways of becoming wealthy , was alarming .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative to an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative for an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The aim of the latter project is to publish a world report on organized crime every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall27 establish as criminal offences28 the following conduct :  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
Working mechanisms and standard operating procedures between competent national and international bodies established with a view to preventing and detecting diversion of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into illicit traffic ;  
The Programme is playing a catalytic role in the development of a comprehensive and reliable international monitoring mechanism , including the development of a scientifically sound yield assessment methodology and the determination of yield figures for selected countries to guide and assess the progress of measures implemented by the international community to eliminate or significantly reduce the illicit cultivation of cannabis , coca and opium poppy by the year 2008 .  
The concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Emphasizes that mediation and restorative justice measures can lead to satisfaction for victims as well as to the prevention of future illicit behaviour and can represent a viable alternative to short terms of imprisonment and to fines , which are in certain cases practically impossible to collect ;  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall29 establish as criminal offences30 the following conduct :  
Lastly , the two parties expressed satisfaction that the negotiation and signature of important draft agreements on tourism , cooperation in combating illicit traffic and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , and cooperation and mutual assistance in combating illegal financial operations had reached an advanced stage .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Being conscious of the international dimension of the illegal flow of armaments , Georgia stands ready to contribute to the multilateral efforts and to cooperate in negotiating effective instruments to this end , in particular , a global convention on illicit arms trafficking .  
Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , psycho _ social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
The Group recommends that the study on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States , requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of resolution 53 / 77 E , should be completed in time for it to be considered at the international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , to be convened no later than 2001 .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
Any decision on the venue of the international conference on the illicit arms trade must take into account the need to ensure the most advantageous financial conditions for the participants in the conference ; a broad geographical spectrum of participating countries ; maximum effectiveness of the work of the conference ; and the necessary security guarantees for delegations .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The conference , for this purpose , should consider the main factors leading and contributing to the excessive accumulation of small arms and may adopt a plan of action consisting of specific coordinated efforts by the international community to reduce and prevent illicit trafficking as well as to face and resolve the problems associated with the excessive accumulation of small arms .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
The Agency also reported that a new technical cooperation project had been initiated , entitled Physical Protection and Security of Nuclear Materials , designed to increase the national capacity in countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials , as well as for the prevention of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials .  
The Council requested the OAU secretariat to organize a preparatory conference of continental experts on the matter , prior to the convening of the United Nations international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , and to seek the support of relevant United Nations agencies and other actors concerned , so as to evolve a common approach for Africa .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
The Buenos Aires seminar represented a first initiative undertaken in cooperation with the Department for Disarmament Affairs pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 T , in which the Secretary-General is requested to hold broad-based consultations on illicit trafficking in small arms , taking into account the ongoing work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms , with all Member States , interested regional and subregional organizations , international agencies and experts .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
UNDCP is playing a catalytic role in providing the strategy for achieving this goal , in close cooperation with national and international partners and international financial institutions engaged in poverty eradication , health and education to improve the overall quality of life in areas affected by illicit cultivation of narcotic crops , thereby reducing incentives for the cultivation of illicit crops .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
The enormous financial gains from illicit transactions , the abundant availability of small arms and the most sophisticated weaponry alike , as well as easy access to technology all help to create an ever more dangerous type of terrorist .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall29 establish as criminal offences30 the following conduct :  
Under the authority of the national committee on the use of illicit drugs , the relevant national institutions had focused their activities on human resource development , scientific research , periodic evaluation and the provision of services to the most vulnerable sectors of society , including young people .  
As far as verification was concerned , the international community should support the UNDCP initiative on the establishment of an independent , neutral and objective global monitoring system to enable States to measure the extent of illicit cultivation on their territory and to take the appropriate measures .  
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add , including public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
Situated on the crossroads between the east and the west , the north and the south of the continent , Belarus will be further contributing to international cooperation in combating transborder crime , terrorism and illicit drug trafficking .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
In effect States should undertake additional measures , such as stepping up efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines , combating the excessive stockpiling and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , addressing the fate of children involved in armed conflicts , protecting and assisting internally displaced people and ensuring the rapid entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court .  
It is for this reason that the ongoing illicit trafficking in and the systematic plundering of its works of art are harmful not only to the countries that own these works of art and archaeological treasures , but also to universal culture and human civilization .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
In the press release she published herself on 19 June , at the end of her visit , the Special Rapporteur endorsed this appeal and emphasized the vital nature of preventive action at national , regional and international level to halt the illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which seriously threatened the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
It is also important that in the region of north and south America a reliable information and data network be set up which would make it possible to establish a warning system to prevent illicit trafficking and to coordinate action to counter and curb such trafficking , including the tracing of networks and organized rings .  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
Pass and enforce necessary anti-corruption laws on campaign financing ; independence of supreme audit bodies ; freedom of information ; conflict of interest ; freedom of the media and freedom of expression ; protection of whistle-blowers and witnesses ; shifting the burden of proof regarding confiscation of illicit enrichment ; decreasing the discretionary powers of the executive ; amnesty ; and investigative powers to conduct integrity tests or other investigative measures ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In fifth place , as regards general disarmament , we emphasize the need to advance towards total elimination of nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons ; illicit trafficking in small arms , and the use of antipersonnel mines and explosive devices .  
It is a paradox that some rich countries have such lax laws that they provide safe havens and encourage private banks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons from poor countries by facilitating the establishment of secret accounts .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
Only through concerted and collective action on the part of the entire international community can we combat phenomena such as severe financial and economic crises , regional conflicts , international terrorism , organized crime and the illicit drug trade .  
To come together in order to counter the evil role played by diamonds in armed conflict is an excellent , irreproachable initiative , because this illicit trade is prejudicial to peace , particularly in Africa .  
This illicit and inhumane business is of a complex and transnational nature , and the wide range of organized crime that it creates is disrupting normal life in eastern Iran and adversely affecting the rest of the country .  
A large number of these illegal immigrants are linked to organized international crime and terrorism , narcomafia , illicit trade in arms , human smuggling , juvenile crime and prostitution and are responsible for the criminalization of Kosovo and Metohija .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
His Government acknowledged the need for adequate and effective measures to interdict illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials and believed that new and more comprehensive cooperative efforts might be required .  
They stressed the special importance of cooperation in alternative development , including the better integration of the most vulnerable sectors involved in the illicit drug market into legal and viable economic activities .  
If the political will is summoned to deny the ability of warring factions to sustain their illicit trade in natural resources , a vital lifeline that supports and sustains armed conflict will be degraded , if not destroyed .  
In recent years , the grave threat posed by small arms especially by the illicit manufacture of and trafficking and trade in small arms to social development , civilian safety and regional security has become a common concern of the international community .  
Residual effects of regional conflicts and of the tension that marked the cold war have led to an unprecedented increase in the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , whose intended recipients are mainly developing countries .  
The international community has unequivocally condemned and rejected the Talibans ideological orientations , which have been responsible for the Taliban territories emerging as the worlds principal centre of international terrorism , illicit drugs and violation of human rights , principally those of women .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
The consequences of war , acts of genocide , armed conflicts , family violence , international terrorism , organized crime , and trafficking in humans and drugs , as well as weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , have devastating consequences for children and a profound impact on their lives and their communities .  
Determined to alleviate the plight of populations in the regions of the world besieged by armed conflicts and criminality , which are fuelled by illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , in a manner that would bring the benefits of social and economic development and national , regional and international stability ,  
Objective : To strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Governments in tackling crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems .  
Gravely concerned with the illicit manufacturing , stockpiling of , trafficking in , possession and use of firearms and , especially , those used in the commission of violent crimes and their contribution to the high level of instability , prolonged conflict and social dislocation that is evident in southern Africa and the African continent as a whole ,  
With regard to the use of non-controlled substitute chemicals in the illicit manufacture of drugs , the substances and guidelines included in the limited international special surveillance list established by the Board were a useful tool for Governments , promoting awareness and cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion of those substances .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Urges Governments and regional organizations to make use of the limited international special surveillance list of substances established by the Board , adapted or supplemented , where appropriate , by lists of chemicals subject to voluntary monitoring , to reflect national and regional situations and changing trends in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
Draws the attention of all States to the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , 2 signed at the High-level Political Signing Conference held in Palermo , Italy , from 12 to 15 December 2000 , and of the protocols thereto , 3 , 4 which strengthen the countermeasures against transnational organized crime by , inter alia , providing a concrete basis for international cooperation and for effective law enforcement action to deal in an integrated manner with all interrelated aspects of illicit trafficking ;  
In view of the alarming increase in the illicit manufacture , trafficking and abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS , UNDCP was called upon to give higher priority to supporting Governments to counter the problem posed by those substances at the global level .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,  
In this context it is important to differentiate between piracy , which is an international crime under international law and can only be committed on the high seas and in the exclusive economic zone , and any other illicit acts or criminal actions committed within the jurisdiction of a State , which are therefore punishable under national law .  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed . 
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
However , in some areas , by exploiting existing legislative and administrative gaps and unregulated grey areas , they facilitate illicit deals in violation of international norms and national laws and regulations governing these activities .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
States are encouraged , subject to their national practices , to enhance , according to their respective constitutional and legal systems , mutual legal assistance and other forms of cooperation in order to assist investigations and prosecutions in relation to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
As individuals and States alike bear the grave consequences of terror and organized crime , which are fuelled and aided by illicit trafficking in small arms , ammunition and explosives , the efforts of the international community are both urgent and vital .  
The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
However , deregulation without accompanying measures , such as the establishment of professional bodies ( haulier associations ) to set professional standards and maintain discipline among members , could create a vacuum which could be exploited by unscrupulous operators engaging in illicit or illegal practices .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
Among such steps are the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards , revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material , improving national standards of security and physical protection of nuclear material , establishing stronger regulatory control over radioactive sources and enhancing international cooperation against illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
The Institute , in partnership with subregional groupings of member States and in close cooperation with certain concerned civil society organizations , has been involved in implementing subregional initiatives and priorities undertaken towards responding to vital national security concerns and finding practical solutions and support with respect to the problem of illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
My delegation believes that security is a subject that is not linked to international peace and security alone , but encompasses a series of elements within a multisectoral framework that , in addition to security , includes the commitment to promote democracy and full respect for human rights , to battle crime and illicit drugs , and to foster overall social and economic development in a harmonious way .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
The international community must develop and improve efforts to integrate the most vulnerable social sectors involved in the illicit drug trade through legal and viable economic activities .  
Relying on social strengths , resorting to legal , administrative , economic and educational means , and adopting a holistic approach were all effective ways to tackle the problem of illicit drugs .  
International efforts in response to that threat , particularly those agreed on at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , reflected widespread awareness of the need to take global , integrated action to reduce drug abuse and eliminate illicit trafficking .  
Such measures are , inter alia , collection and responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered ; confidence-building measures ; disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants ; demining ; and conversion ,  
As a primary sponsor of that draft resolution , South Africa is particularly pleased that the Secretariat managed to source from existing budgetary provisions adequate funding for the conference servicing required for the first biennial meeting of States contemplated in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution , as well as for the meetings of a group of experts to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument for tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , referred to in paragraph 10 .  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
Noting also that the problem of corrupt practices and the transfer of funds of illicit origin , as well as the need to prevent the transfer of and to return such funds , have social , economic and legal implications that require comprehensive , holistic examination at the national and international levels ,  
Noting also that the problem of corrupt practices and the transfer of funds of illicit origin , as well as the need to prevent the transfer of such funds , and to return them , have social , economic and legal implications that require comprehensive , holistic examination at the national and international levels ,  
The expansion of global knowledge of and expertise to deal with crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money-laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems ;  
Strengthening or developing agreed norms and measures at the global , regional and national levels that would reinforce and further coordinate efforts to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ;  
Systematic or methodical illicit enrichment of a public official of unlawful financial proceeds obtained through a series or combination of corrupt acts as defined in articles [ . . . ] of this Convention , penalties for which may vary according to the gravity of the offence , and as may be determined by the participating States ;  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination mechanisms for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ; Article 18 .
