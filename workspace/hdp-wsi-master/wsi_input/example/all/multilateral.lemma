The practice of the half century since World War II has proven that the moves of GATT and the WTO in achieving big multilateral reductions in tariffs and nontariff measures , actively spurring the liberalization of international trade , enhancing the transparency of members ' trade policies , resolving trade disputes , and accepting large numbers of developing countries and regions to take part in the multilateral trade setup have played an extremely important role in expanding international trade and promoting world economic development .  
The Bangkok Declaration emphasized the necessity of establishing a fair and regular " multilateral trade system " and operating in a nondiscriminating and transparent way , which would be conducive to all the countries , the developing ones in particular .  
We must speed up the training of a number of specialized talented personnel who are familiar with China 's national condition , who have a good command of foreign languages , plenty of specialized knowledge , and who understand WTO regulations and international economic laws , to master and apply basic WTO knowledge and regulations , effectively participate in drawing up international trade regulations , and make full use of the multilateral regulations and international conventions to develop our foreign trade and preserve our legitimate interests .  
Being the largest multilateral economic organization for the standardized international economic and trade rules in the contemporary world , the WTO has formulated and implemented a complete set of multilateral trade rules with a very extensive coverage , which almost involve all facets of the contemporary world 's economy and trade and have legal effect and standards .  
The DPRK 's active efforts to push its multilateral diplomacy , increase exchanges with other countries of the world , create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean peninsula , launch foreign trade and economic cooperation , and speed up domestic economic construction are beneficial .  
The United States also believes that , looking at the balance of forces in the Asia-Pacific region , the western forces headed by itself are overwhelmingly superior , and so the present moment is an excellent opportunity for establishing a constraining multilateral security mechanism under its own control , capable of resolving substantive problems .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
Despite the past 50 years and especially the last 10 since the end of the Cold War , the international environment the US faces has undergone tremendous changes but the " support system " the US established and runs has not changed .  Post-Cold War economic and military conflicts between the US and European Union have not caused any bilateral or multilateral damage .  
It has thoroughly given up the practice of either leaning toward the West or confronting the West , but has adopted an omnidirectional foreign strategy of conducting dialogue , laying equal stress on relations with the East and the West , developing relations with big powers , and strengthening bilateral or multilateral relations with other countries , aimed at protecting its national interests , particularly economic interests .  
Today , as the world moves toward globalization , and more and more nations are resolving international disputes through international institutions or multilateral diplomacy , the American style of wantonly engaging in military ventures is a bit ironic : a great nation that promotes globalization , the nation with the most speaking privileges in the world 's largest international institutions displaying this kind of outdated militaristic view of national security and unilateralism in its diplomacy that rejects multilateral negotiations !  
After our WTO entry , China , as a member country of the World Trade Organization , will enjoy multilateral , unconditional and stable most-favored nation treatment .  When we become involved in a trade dispute involving agriculture products , we can rely on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to reach a more fair and reasonable solution , and this will reduce such unfair treatment as non-tariff restrictions aimed at Chinese agricultural exports by other countries .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
The United States has shown contempt for international multilateral or bilateral agreements , obstructed international efforts to cut greenhouse gas emission , announced at the end of March that it would not ratify the " Kyoto Protocol , " single-mindedly wanted to develop and deploy the National Missile Defense system in disregard of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " signed in 1972 with the Soviet Union .  
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
The institute 's objective is : On the basis of the country 's basic national policy of carrying out reforms , opening up to the outside world , and building a market economic system , it will serve China 's modernization drive by engaging in comprehensive studies of WTO-based multilateral trade systems and international issues about economic integration , globalization , and economic and trade policies of all countries .  
Xiang Huaicheng told Chinese reporters in an exclusive interview that during their visit to Germany , China and Germany completely agreed that both countries shared an extensive consensus on many major international financial and monetary issues ; and the two countries should continue stepping up cooperation in multilateral international institutions and forums , including the IMF , the World Bank , as well as the 20-Nation Group and the Asian-European Financial Ministers ' Conference . Meanwhile , the two countries should also further expand mutual financial and economic exchanges .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Senior officials exchanged views on the possible elements that may be included in the new round of WTO talks and some specific initiatives raised by member economies , pointing out that a balanced agenda should be facilitated for the multilateral trade talks in order to benefit all member economies , especially the developing economies , through a multilateral trading system .  
Not only is a new round of multilateral trade talks a major issue that concerns all countries today , but APEC 's 21 APEC member nations account for about half of world trade and half of the global economy .  Their voice has a decisive role on the international economic stage .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
The ministers unanimously held that it is necessary to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation , push forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation within APEC , and step up economic and technical cooperation in order to meet challenges of the new century with practical action .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
The ministers reaffirmed the statement of the Brunei Ministerial Conference and Informal Leadership Meeting on launching a new round of multilateral trade talks in 2001 , held that the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in November in Qatar represents a critical opportunity for the launch of a new round of WTO talks and that it is necessary to accelerate WTO work , speedily formulate a balanced , operational , broad-based agenda for the talks , and expressed particular concern for the interests of developing members .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
For this purpose , President Jiang put forward four proposals , namely , " replenishing and developing the ' Shanghai Five ' mechanism " , " deepening cooperation in the security field , " " advancing bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation " , and " strengthening cooperation on the international stage " .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
It stands for extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange to put peace and security on a more solid foundation .  " Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
At the fifth " Shanghai Five " summit held in July 2000 in Dushanbe , leaders of the member states reiterated their determination to " jointly combat such international criminal activities that contribute the most threats to the region 's security , stability and development such as ethnic separatism , religious extremism , international terrorism , illegal arms smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal migration . "  It also proposed to sign treaties and pacts on multilateral cooperation among the member states .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
As compared with the period of the Clinton Administration that attached importance to multilateral cooperation , the Bush Administration regards multilateral agreements more as restricting the freedom of movement of the United States . It carries a strong color of unilateralism , judges everything by the yardstick of the " supreme national interests of the United States , " and ignores its international obligations .  
He said : Although the Protocol negotiations are now suffering a serious setback , the Chinese side remains convinced that a balanced and effective protocol concluded through multilateral negotiations is not only beneficial to various signatories to the Convention but is also conducive to world peace and security .  As always , the Chinese side will join the various sides in making unrelenting efforts for the realization the common objective of strengthening the effectiveness of the Convention in comprehensive manner .  
Wu Hailong said that this year the APEC meeting discussed in depth trade and investment liberalization , strengthening of a multilateral trade structure , economic and technological cooperation , exploitation of human resources , and new economies , among other issues .  The results achieved in the meeting laid a sound foundation for the October informal APEC leaders ' meeting and ministerial meeting to be held in Shanghai .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation . "

"  
He said , joining the WTO will usher in a new historical phase for China 's reform and open up .  Under the multilateral , stable , unconditional most-favored-nation principle extended by the WTO to its members , China can enter into international trade and economic cooperation and create the favorable international environment for the development of its national economic and foreign economic and trade relations and promote the country 's national economic development .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
11 .  The two sides emphasize the importance of exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern .  They are willing to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and work to build a just and rational international political and economic new order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The foreign ministers of the five countries express their deep worry over the increasingly rampant activities of the forces of national separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .  They hold that those forces are the main threat to regional security and stability and it is necessary to tackle the situation through strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation , including the signing of related treaties and agreements by the " five countries . "  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .  To this end , the five countries will draw up relevant multilateral outlines as early as possible ;  
11 .  Both sides emphasized that exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern is of great significance , and are willing to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation and to make efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the UN Charter as well as established principles of international laws .  
The proposal stressed : The four countries in the region will conduct multilateral scientific , technological , and economic cooperation in animal husbandry , planting , ecologically non-destructive mining industry , and transnational tourist industry .  They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
In the face of such a new situation , ever since last year , the DPRK has been taking active steps to readjust its foreign policies .  It has engaged itself in multilateral diplomatic activities ; and has made positive headway in such aspects as improving the North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula , strengthening its relations with neighboring countries , and seeking to promote its ties with both western countries and countries in other parts of the world .  
enable the Chinese enterprises to carry out international trade and economic cooperation in line with the principle of multilateral , stable , and unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to the WTO members ; be conducive to China developing its relatively advantageous sectors ; and is of major significance for China to enjoy the benefits brought by the multilateral trade system and by the economic globalization .  
He said that the international community should change the state of affairs where the actual policymaking power of major multilateral economic organizations have long been held in the hands of a few countries ; instead , the large number of developing countries should have a say in the policymaking process , rather than merely accept in a passive manner the rules formulated by others .  
Once the NMD system is deployed , the results in bilateral and multilateral disarmament and arms control obtained over the past several years will be destroyed in one day .  With the destruction of global strategic stability , unilateralism in international relations will increase .  There will be more unstable factors in both global and regional security .  
The statement calls on various countries to painstakingly contribute to maintaining the situation of world and regional security , establish a new international political and economic order , quicken the tempo of multilateral international trade and the opening up of regional organizations , intensify the economic and financial cooperation and scientific and technological exchanges between the two continents in the era of information , and so on .  
Gore seemed to lay greater stress on establishing an Asia-Pacific multilateral security mechanism and attach greater importance to the US ' relations with China , but he stressed that Japan was the US ' principal ally in Asia . Gore and the younger Bush shared identical views on the two key issues of stressing Japan being the principal ally of the US in Asia , and of maintaining the US military presence in Asia .  
At the 12th APEC Ministerial Conference being held here on 12 November , Tang Jiaxuan , minister of foreign affairs , and Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , respectively made a speech on the issues that cover , among other things , the economic and technological cooperation , the new economy , the development of human resources , the intensification of multilateral trade structure , and the trade and investment liberalization - - the principal subjects for discussion at the current conference .  
Shi Guangsheng added : APEC should impel the WTO to work out an agenda for the new round of talks , which will balance and reflect the interests of all parties , those of the developing member countries in particular , resolve the problems that the vast number of developing countries are concerned about , and strive to make the results of talks conducive to the establishment of a still fairer and opener multilateral trade structure , so as to play a positive role in promoting the economic development of all member countries .  
They stressed that a healthy and fair multilateral trade system will improve the sustainable and stable growth of world trade and promote common prosperity for both the developed nations and the developing nations .  
IV . To continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation and coordination at the United Nations , ASEAN Regional Forum , East Asia Cooperation , APEC , ASEM and other international and regional multilateral fronts and promote the solidarity and cooperation of the developing countries .  To continue to work for the establishment of a just and rational new international political and economic order and make new contributions to the maintenance of peace , stability and development in the region and the world at large .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said when interviewed by Xinhua reporters today that in the past year China has achieved gratifying success in actively and steadily promoting relations with the major powers , making every effort to create a stable and peaceful peripheral environment , consolidating and developing relations with the developing countries , and vigorously promoting multilateral diplomacy and regional cooperation .  This has laid a good foundation for China to actively pursue all-round diplomacy in the new century .  
At a news conference after the end of the meeting , Wang Guangya said : the senior officials of all participating economic entities unanimously agreed that APEC should advance economic and technological cooperation in the fields of energy construction and human resources while maintaining the momentum of the process of trade and investment liberalization , and should make efforts to start a new round of multilateral trade talks as early as possible on the basis of formulating a balanced agenda .  
He pointed out : There have been frequent exchanges of visits , as well as meetings at international multilateral occasions , between the leaders of our two countries ; and both sides hold identical or similar views on many major issues , including the issues of promoting bilateral relations and safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsular .  Besides , the two countries have also maintained a sound cooperation in international affairs .  
" Against our free trade philosophy , the prime objectives of Hong Kong for the international trade forums are two-fold : first , to further the benefits of trade liberalisation with a view to achieving the global free trade and second , to maintain a rule-based multilateral trading system which is relevant and responsive to the needs of the modern business world , " he said .  
The World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund , as the most influential multilateral financial institutions , will preserve their vigor and hold out a bright future only when they can undergo timely readjustments and reform in keeping with the new and shifting world situation and give expression to the reasonable demands of the developing countries .  
The meeting just concluded was a great success .  It provided WCO Member administrations in the region with a valuable opportunity to share their views on a wide range of Customs subjects , including , the application of international instrument for trade facilitation , strengthening of enforcement capability in combating transnational crimes such as Amphetamine Type Stimulants ( ATS ) and internet piracy , promotion of multilateral co-operation for mutual administrative assistance and out-reaching with the business sector for partnership .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
China continued to play a positive role in multilateral activities and major international affairs , and participated in diplomatic activities of both the United Nations and regional organizations in a wide range of areas , contributing to world peace and common development , it says  
Recognize that both China and South Africa share many objectives with regard to key multilateral issues and on the urgent need for the reform of the international multilateral political , economic and financial architecture to reflect new global realities  
States have made considerable progress in concluding bilateral , regional or multilateral agreements aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
This active role of the Organization , in bilateral and multilateral negotiations alike , should extend to the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian spheres .  
It is , therefore , of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping .  
It is , therefore , of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping .  
It is , therefore , fundamental that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation are well focused and that means for coordinating such activities are studied in order to avoid overlapping actions .  
At the international level , a comprehensive and open dialogue and a record of experience between multilateral and bilateral organizations and representatives of civil society should be an integral part of the institutional arrangements .  
Such efforts , encouraged and supported by sustained bilateral and multilateral assistance , could pave the way for broader and more ambitious schemes for regional cooperation on an equitable basis .  
Three additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1315 ) .  
Four additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1316 ) .  
An interim multilateral fund was created to assist developing countries meet their incremental costs ( mainly technical and financial ) resulting from the adoption of substitute technologies to help them comply with the Protocol 's phaseout provisions .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
While national efforts are the key to a successful export strategy , bilateral and multilateral support , including longterm capital , should make a major difference in reducing the period required to achieve the expected results . 
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
States continued to make progress in concluding bilateral , regional or multilateral agreements aimed at suppressing illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Instead of coordinating their macroeconomic policies , however , the industrialized countries had sought to resolve their domestic problems in a purely national or restricted multilateral context .  
A strong and effective multilateral system with the United Nations at its centre is an essential prerequisite for successful multilateral cooperation on development and international economic policy and operations .  
The draft articles provided explicit rules under which watercourse States were entitled to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements , tailored to their specific needs , provided that they respected the general principles set forth in the articles .  
It was noted that the Moroccan Constitution established the equality of all citizens before the law and the rights of foreigners in Morocco , that Morocco had recently set up an advisory council for human rights composed of representatives of all parties concerned , and that bilateral and multilateral conventions ratified in the manner prescribed by the Constitution were incorporated in domestic law and their provisions could be invoked before Moroccan courts .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
Indeed , the Fourth World Conference on Women , which ended only last month in Beijing , has given impetus to the need for programmes that speak to the issues of women in development and , most critically , the empowerment of women in local communities , enabling their full participation at all levels in the process of national development .  Grenada is encouraged by the new spirit of international cooperation built on a shared partnership between multilateral financial institutions and Governments .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
Today 's world dialectically combines within itself both dangers and threats fraught with instability and the risk of new global shocks , while nourishing the growth of an essentially new and different non-confrontational system of international relations .  Through ever more active multilateral efforts in confronting common challenges , we see more clearly the basic principles of such a system .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
Effective economic cooperation between the countries of the Middle East can be called , without fear of exaggeration , a main component of lasting peace and an essential condition for the development of mutually beneficial and harmonious bilateral and multilateral dialogue .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
An earlier report of the Secretary-General ( A / 45 / 274-E / 1990 / 73 and Corr . 1 ) , submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session through the Economic and Social Council , had stressed the need to adopt comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures in order to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , including new and renewable sources of energy .  
The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
It also confirms our belief in how much can be accomplished through multilateral action if the mandates set by the Council are achievable , the time-frames remain realistic , our approach is flexible and the commitment to peace among the parties involved is genuine .  
Urges all Governments , competent regional economic integration organizations and the executive heads of the competent specialized agencies and of other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system to continue to present their views to the Secretary-General on institutional developments related to the strengthening of international organizations in the area of multilateral trade ;  
Governments increasingly recognize that their responses to changing circumstances and their desires to achieve sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity , expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
All the main multilateral banks emphasize the need for forest-sector investment lending to be preceded by strong sectoral analysis , policy dialogue and institutional reform , including taking steps to improve regulatory and legal frameworks in forestry and to integrate sector aims and objectives with wider economic and environmental concerns .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
They also welcomed the fact that the draft articles provided explicit rules under which watercourse States were entitled to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements , tailored to their specific needs , provided that they respected the general principles set forth in the articles .  
China hoped that the United States of America and the Russian Federation would implement existing nuclear-disarmament treaties as scheduled and carry out further drastic cuts in their respective nuclear arsenals , thereby creating the necessary conditions for the commencement of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States in order to conclude a convention on the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
For these reasons , many non-nuclear-weapon States continued to express strong preference for a multilateral , legally binding international accord , which would be equal in status to the obligations contained in the non-proliferation Treaty .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
On 4 October 1994 , the Governments of China and of the United States issued a joint statement whereby the two Governments agreed to work together to promote the earliest possible achievement of a multilateral , non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Despite the cyclical fall in contributions to multilateral institutions , developing countries ' receipts from this source were cushioned to some extent by the fact that the multilateral institutions , especially the international financial institutions , can draw on income from previous years to make their current disbursements .  
Replenishments in 1994 should refurbish multilateral commitment potential if the familiar cyclical pattern holds up , but if adequate funds are not forthcoming from donors , the level of the activities of the multilateral agencies could be impaired in later years .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
Effective investigation and prosecution at the national level and close bilateral and multilateral cooperation by countries around the world is essential to addressing the grave problems caused by ongoing criminal enterprises .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In response , the Special Unit has prepared a report which contains a number of recommendations designed to promote and implement a more strategic approach to technical cooperation among developing countries in an effort to make it a dynamic instrument in support of development in the context of the changing realities of multilateral development cooperation .  
Recalling that a reappraisal of the 1921 principle , on which common system remuneration is based , was long overdue , ACC reiterated its concern that the current remuneration system was outdated and needed to be overhauled to become competitive with bilateral and other multilateral financial and aid agencies . 
A provision of $ 58,100 would be required to hire consultants ( $ 24,700 ) to provide specialized inputs for documents related to regional repercussions of bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements , taking into account the evolution of environmental policies and changing production patterns in the housing and urban infrastructure construction sector , including proposals for its modernization , and ( $ 33,400 ) for the convening of three ad hoc expert group meetings .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
Several delegations stressed the need to ensure adequate resources for strengthening activities under programme 12 pertaining to the continuing economic and social transformation in countries with economies in transition and the reporting to the General Assembly and to the Security Council on the implementation of multilateral economic sanctions on the effects of unilateral economic coercive measures .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
Also , in this regard , following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ( April 1994 ) , which included agriculture for the first time in a substantive fashion , there has been a growing interest by developing countries in coming to grips with the changed international trading environment for agriculture and FAO has been developing a programme to respond to this need .  
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
The succession of reciprocal vetoes , the sharpness of the exchanges , the modest scope of many of its resolutions and , above all , its silences in the face of serious crises which affected international peace and security reflected the narrow margin for action available to the Council and the United Nations when set against an overwhelming strategic struggle which shattered the hope for any multilateral solution . 
But when the time comes to negotiate multilateral replenishments , additional multilateral resources are seen as coming at the expense of already stretched bilateral programmes , which are usually perceived to bring political benefits or to respond more closely to donor Government policies and priorities , since the donor itself is responsible for their supervision and control .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
It should give participants access to a comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law enforcement , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills .  
NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
We want to generate broad support for an improved global multilateral system , based upon a renewed political will of all Member States , and which draws on the energies and the commitment of independent organizations of civil society .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
From that standpoint , high priority should be given to implementation of actions such as explicit incorporation of the aid targets and commitments of the Programme of Action in the donors ' aid budgets , increase in the level of concessional multilateral assistance , operationalization of additional flows to social sector , environmental conservation and eradication of poverty and enhancement of the value of aid through improving aid quality .  
That this serious problem should necessitate strengthened efforts on the international debt strategy was acknowledged at the mid-term review , and a number of actions were agreed upon in the areas of official bilateral debt , multilateral debt , and commercial debt .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Recommendation 1 : Wherever United Nations system organizations desire to enhance cooperative relationships with the multilateral financial institutions , their executive heads and the governing bodies responsible for operational activities for development should make a meaningful commitment to increase the competitiveness of their programmes .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
was important to recognize that security was no longer defined as it had been in the cold war era : security was currently threatened by socio-economic problems - massive migrations , global epidemics and environmental degradation - which could only be resolved in the interest of all countries by multilateral action .  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;

the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing countries ,  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 27 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
addition , being aware of the need for concerted efforts on the part of all States , Belarus was actively developing its bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the fight against crime and had already signed , or was preparing to sign , agreements on the subject with various countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and others in Eastern and Western Europe .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
Like other members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , his country supported the concept of a rapidly deployable headquarters team and emphasized the importance of such a team being set up in a transparent manner , bearing in mind the multilateral character of the Organization and the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations as it pertained to the independence of the staff and to equitable geographical distribution . 
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action , taking into account internationally recognized norms and standards ;  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
With respect to article 40 , paragraph 2 , please indicate the relevant international instruments applicable in the area of the administration of juvenile justice , including at the multilateral , regional or bilateral levels , as well as legislative and other appropriate measures adopted to ensure in particular that :  
Relevant bilateral , regional and multilateral agreements concluded or to which the State party may have acceded to foster the prevention of all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation and to ensure the effective protection of child victims , including in the areas of judicial cooperation and cooperation among law enforcement officials ;  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
" Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
" Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
To inform , to educate and to generate public understanding of the importance of and support for multilateral action , including action by the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament , in the field of arms limitation and disarmament , in a factual , balanced and objective manner , in particular through the continuing publication in all official languages of The United Nations Disarmament Yearbook and the Disarmament Periodical , and the updating of the Status of Multilateral Arms Regulation and Disarmament Agreements ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
He was delighted to see that UNCTAD activities which were of importance to his country - such as assistance to developing and transitional economies in integrating into the international trade system , restrictive business practices and competition issues , trade in services , the interrelationship between trade and environment , and the impact of economic regionalization on the multilateral trade system - were duly reflected .  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
With regard to the fact that the rules on reservations to multilateral treaties had been elaborated with the purpose of reconciling two sets of interests ( the need to ensure the universality of a treaty by maximizing participation by States with diverse cultural , economic and political conditions , and the need to preserve the integrity of the treaty ) , it became evident that universality should not only be numerical but also substantive .  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled ' Macroeconomic policy questions ' ;  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
It is indisputably one of the major achievements of the United Nations and has come to be regarded as a multilateral instrument that holds out great promise and vast potential for the maintenance of peace , an equitable basis for sharing the resources of the world 's oceans and a means for securing economic and social progress for all the peoples of the Earth .  
At the same time , the Panel acknowledged that at present no single multilateral body , organization or instrument has either a mandate or the capacity to address , in a balanced , [ integrated ] [ holistic ] and mutually reinforcing way , all forest-related issues currently on the international agenda on sustainable forest management .  
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
In its foreign relations , Viet Nam will constantly pursue an open foreign policy of independence , diversification and the promotion of multilateral relations along the line of gradual regional and international integration , thus making worthy contributions to the cause of peace , national independence , democracy and social progress .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
Indeed , it is in recognition of the critical importance of the success of this peace process to achieve durable peace in the Middle East that Japan has been actively participating in the peace process by engaging in intensified dialogue with the parties directly concerned , by sending its own contingents to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region , and by offering its active contribution to the multilateral talks on the Middle East launched in Madrid in 1991 .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
As a direct consequence of recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) in 1994 , more than a dozen multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies began discussions leading to the formation of the " Urban Forum " , to serve as a vehicle for information exchange , and joint programming in the field of sustainable human settlements development .  
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
It is recognized , however , that the responsibility for coordinating external assistance , from multilateral , bilateral or other international organizations , rests first and foremost with the Government concerned .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
Statements were made that judicial cooperation in general , including cooperation in insolvency matters , was governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties , which typically provided for cooperation based on reciprocity .  For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
With regard to bilateral and multilateral treaties , the five States reported that they had signed a significant number of treaties concerning the protection of the environment , some of which contained penal provisions , and had implemented them in national legislation .  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
In particular , such provisions could invite States , in accordance with or subject to their domestic laws or pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements : ( a ) to take all appropriate measures to prevent preparation in their respective territories for the commission of those offences outside their territories ; ( b ) to exchange information in accordance with their national law ; and ( c ) to coordinate administrative and other measures to be taken , as appropriate , to prevent the commission of offences set forth in the convention .  
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
The Conference welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and hoped that it would be reinforced by additional bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce the debt stock of all African countries .  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
Several Governments have reported efforts to eradicate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants , and countries in which such illicit cultivation remains a problem have sought international assistance through bilateral or multilateral agreements to implement alternative development programmes .  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Requests all concerned organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the regional commissions and other relevant international and multilateral institutions , to make , within their respective fields of competence , substantive contributions and proposals for further action as submissions to the preparatory process of the Conference ;  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The Parties believe that it is essential to continue to make joint coordinated efforts with a view to establishing , in the area within the purview of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , bilateral and multilateral international relations based on the generally accepted principles and norms of international law ;  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .  
The Commission encouraged the Secretariat to devise ways to address the continuing and significant increase in the importance being attributed by Governments , by domestic and international business communities and by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to improving the legal framework for international trade and investment .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
The sponsors are submitting these three draft resolutions driven by a strong desire that the Organization should make a further concrete and constructive contribution to the multiplicity of efforts bilateral , multilateral or undertaken by individuals or by Governments aimed at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine .  
This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process , particularly on the bilateral tracks , and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
The cold war had just ended , and barriers both real and perceived were falling , paving the way for precisely this type of treaty negotiated on a multilateral basis , as opposed to the bipolar accords with which the world was more familiar .  
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
This multifaceted process of sustainable development necessitates constant and close multilateral cooperation as well as concerted efforts on a regional and national basis .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
IMO forwarded a document entitled " Status of international conventions relating to marine pollution of which IMO is depositary or responsible for secretariat duties " , which provided information of relevance to the issues of concluded bilateral and multilateral treaties , including legislation to ensure their implementation , and information on the status of implementation of international conventions at the national level .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
If there is a sense that a dynamic and genuinely interactive process is under way , involving progress at both bilateral and multilateral levels , we are convinced that wide international support will be forthcoming .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
All the while , a core of supporting multilateral agencies , despite severe financial constraints , have provided some of the required support and sought together , in a pragmatic manner , to identify their comparative advantages in responding to the countries ' perceived needs and in identifying the respective areas of complementarity .  
The central themes of the discussions were the following : the promotion of cooperation in law enforcement and the exchange of information on drug traffickers ; harmonization of various bilateral , multilateral and regional approaches to controlling substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the legislative frameworks , so as to facilitate the worldwide exchange of information on suspicious transactions involving such substances ; and the eradication of illicit crops and the development of programmes to advance crop substitution and alternative development projects .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
Provision of specialized data and information products and services in computer-generated formats on the status of the Convention and the related Agreements ; bilateral and multilateral treaties and other legal instruments ; national legislation ; charts and geographical coordinates of maritime zones ; the limits of the continental shelf ; and national maritime profile ;  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
Because multilateral funding is declining and there is a tendency to become more dependent on directed multilateral contributions , WFP is intensifying its efforts to secure resources at the field level by ensuring that donor representatives are well informed of WFP activities and by broadening its donor base for the long term .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
In particular , it was assisting the national commission to combat illicit drug use in its coordination activities and had amended its organic law on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1993 to make it more compatible with the multilateral mechanisms in existence .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
With regard to the external debt , the initiatives taken by the Bretton Woods institutions and creditor countries to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and to find solutions to multilateral debt were insufficient and of limited scope , and the situation of middle-income countries which met their obligations promptly and in full was likewise unresolved ; hence a comprehensive and radical solution to the debt problem must be found .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
Despite its political will to carry out the necessary reforms , the Cambodian Government continued to face two major obstacles : the enormous bilateral and multilateral debt , which constituted a heavy burden on the Government , and poorer access to markets and deteriorating terms of trade .  
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
One major initiative , of which UNDP was one of the main supporters , was the Micro-credit Summit held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 , which brought together 2,500 participants from more than 100 countries , including beneficiaries of micro-finance programmes , organizers of micro-credit projects , commercial and development banks , non-governmental organizations , multilateral and bilateral donors , as well as heads of Government and senior officials who were heads of small business promotional institutions . 
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
In extreme cases , where coercive economic measures are most likely to have important long-term effects , such measures are usually multilateral , comprehensive in scope , extensive in duration and also frequently coincide with civil or other military conflict that also thwarts economic development .  
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
The expert group agreed that the problems raised by the imposition of coercive economic measures , including their economic , social , political and legal aspects , deserve increased attention by the international community and multilateral bodies .  
Although these States are responsible for their future , the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa demand a multilateral response to the political , economic and social ills of the region , and the need to address development issues is paramount .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
As Member States and international multilateral organizations pondered such policies , at a minimum those policies must be balanced between rights and legal obligations ; be technologically feasible and economically reasonable ; and be technologically effective .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
Looking forward to when we come to the practical realization of the ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons , multilateral negotiations on an international agreement on the subject will obviously also become essential .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
Wide areas such as rules of origin in autonomous or contractual preferential agreements remain , as far as the multilateral system is concerned , under soft law regulations and not guided by common disciplines .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
That concept remained valid and relevant and was likely to assume additional importance in the light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .

Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
Despite the efforts of the affected countries and the intervention of the multilateral financial institutions , the crisis had not abated and the potential consequences for those countries included a reduced rate of liberalization ; the possibility that they might seriously consider defaulting on their debt ; the contraction of expenditure , which inevitably meant reduced spending on social services ; and the possibility of widespread social and political upheaval .  
Since its establishment by the General Assembly in 1963 , it had advised United Nations bodies , the national institutions of Member States and non-governmental organizations through training programmes in a variety of disciplines ( multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management , peacemaking and preventive diplomacy , environmental law , migration policy and law , capacity-building in the field of economic and social development ) .  
On this point some delegations expressed preference for a framework convention , arguing that States would be bound by the provisions of such an instrument without losing the freedom to conclude more detailed bilateral or multilateral agreements with respect to specific hazardous or harmful activities or geographical regions with a high concentration of such activities .  
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .

As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
Moreover , the growth of TCDC can be measured not only through the number and range of TCDC-related projects completed or ongoing but also by the spread of new TCDC configurations , including a sharp increase in country-to-country bilateral TCDC projects , the recent phenomenon of donor country involvement in triangular funding schemes , and the proliferation of partnerships among intergovernmental organizations , non-governmental organizations and other players within the multilateral system .  
The objectives of the report were to make UNU an integral part of the United Nations renewal process ; to explore ways by which its potential could be realized more fully as a strategic intellectual resource for the multilateral system of cooperation ; and to strengthen its adaptability to the emerging or uncharted challenges of the next century .  
In this connection , UNIDO has combined its unique technical and sectoral expertise with technical cooperation provided by other multilateral and bilateral agencies to enhance technological upgrading of industry and facilitate the adoption of production processes consistent with new global standards for quality , cleaner production and energy efficiency in small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) .  
There is , therefore , a need for the Council to consider arrangements to allow additional funding through either bilateral or multilateral sources , over and above those made under the programme , still subject to existing financial controls established by relevant decisions of the Council .  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;

In addition , a wealth of knowledge can be tapped through a participatory process and strategic partnerships forged at the common country assessment stage , not only among the United Nations system partners , including the Bretton Woods institutions , but foremost with relevant government entities , civil society , including NGOs , and the private sector , as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ; special issues of least developed countries / Africa / heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;

To support and ensure effective follow-up of bilateral and multilateral initiatives , including regional and subregional consultation processes , where appropriate , to develop national policies and cooperative strategies to maximize the benefits and manage the challenges posed by international migration ;  
It is therefore of utmost importance to recognize that responses to those changing circumstances and the achievement of sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity and exchange of ideas and information expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
The Advisory Group wishes to express its deep gratitude to all the entities at the multilateral and bilateral levels involved in assisting Haiti in completing its task , in particular the World Bank , the office of the representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti , and the office of the resident coordinator in Haiti .  
The Secretary-General was also requested to create a Scientific and Technical Committee , of 20 to 25 experts selected in consultation with their Governments , to develop overall programmes to be taken into account in bilateral and multilateral cooperation for the Decade , paying attention to priorities and gaps in technical knowledge identified at the national levels ( for an assessment of the work of the Committee , see A / 54 / 132 / Add . 1E / 1999 / 80 / Add . 1 ) .  
The preventive concept as embodied in IDNDR has received a considerable boost through the United Nations reform , one of the main reform messages being the shift towards a multilateral platform which would enable the international community to deal with the challenges of the future and the risks of the future in a proactive and effective manner .  
Being conscious of the international dimension of the illegal flow of armaments , Georgia stands ready to contribute to the multilateral efforts and to cooperate in negotiating effective instruments to this end , in particular , a global convention on illicit arms trafficking .  
The Council calls on the international community to support broad _ based trade liberalization and to address in the next round of multilateral negotiations all the pertinent issues which can hinder the ability of African economies to be more competitive .  
Conserving the environment , the advent of the information age and continued exploration of the solar system are just some of the important global issues in relation to which space technology can play a leading role in the coming years and many multilateral mechanisms already exist to promote greater international cooperation , in particular with a view to assisting developing countries .  
With this in mind , educational and training activities should be strengthened and supported by bilateral and multilateral programmes adapted to domestic needs , which should also consider the strenghthening of such as the regional training centres for space science and technology education established with the assistance of the United Nations .  
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
As a multilateral organization with an impressive record of achievements in the industrialization of developing countries and with rich experience in cooperation with the donor countries and international organizations , UNIDO was well qualified to facilitate the flow of resources needed for industrial technical cooperation .  
Allow me also to express the hope that this recently adopted decision will constitute a spur to promote the work of the Conference on Disarmament and afford us a real opportunity to share with the five new members the arduous work which the international community expects of us in negotiating multilateral disarmament treaties with particular attention to the objective of achieving a world which is free of nuclear weapons .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
Information and education efforts should be intensified , especially in the context of bilateral or multilateral technical cooperation programmes , with a view to ensuring respect for and proper implementation of certain existing laws which provide sufficient procedural guarantees . 
At this critical juncture , the Nagasaki conference considered , inter alia , how to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons capability ; how to improve and strengthen the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime ; the multilateral approach towards nuclear disarmament and the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons ; immediate priorities to avoid accidental nuclear war ; how to promote nuclear disarmament and practical steps to that end ; and national and regional security today .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
A joint study was entitled Strengthening the participation of developing countries in world trade and the multilateral trading system was carried out in 1996 , which included sections on improving market access in commercial services and improving the domestic supply response .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
Member States and non-governmental organizations were invited to contribute to the proposed database of good practices and lessons learned on all forms of violence against women , information on bilateral and multilateral agreements , national experiences and lessons learned , initiatives and projects that had proved viable and effective in evolving national strategies and strengthening bilateral , regional and international cooperation for dealing with violence against women migrant workers . 
These are : insisting on the proposal to send an international security force ; adopting measures involving economic pressure on Indonesia at the multilateral and individual levels ; and providing , as quickly as possible , multifaceted , coordinated and duly protected international humanitarian assistance to the people .  
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
UNDP / GEF seed resources will be matched by additional co-financing from the countries of the region and from bilateral and multilateral organizations directed towards the global FOCADES account or to specific thematic accounts .  
For combating such negative phenomena as drugs , organized crime and money-laundering , strengthened international cooperation by combining national efforts , the adoption of multilateral norms and international codes of conduct , as appropriate , and the development of multilateral regional or subregional cooperation , wherever suitable , are obvious areas requiring ongoing United Nations initiatives and action .  
Our country is pursuing in practice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view to establishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral relations with all the countries of the world and to strengthening international security and stability .  
To develop the economic and entrepreneurial cooperation among the member countries and to enhance the existing potential by drawing up and implementing projects of common interest , exploring , to this end , the various forms of bilateral , trilateral and multilateral cooperation ;  
Because worldwide economic problems pose a challenge to the social development efforts of individual countries , these issues should be approached in an integrated manner that involves national Governments , regional and multilateral organizations and relevant market actors .  
One important and urgent challenge for the United Nations is that of including , as part of its activities in the economic , social and financial fields , the in-depth consideration of issues such as financial crisis prevention and management , issues pertaining to financing for development , the rules of access to multilateral resources and the role of regional institutions , while respecting the areas in which national autonomy must be preserved .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , States Parties are encouraged to make , when necessary , on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality , appropriate bilateral or multilateral arrangements for using special investigative techniques at the international level .  
On the one hand , the multilateral framework of WTO rules has in certain cases narrowed the range of policy options for Governments : quantitative tools of protection are now largely ruled out , including production allocations and similar means ; tariffs are increasingly subject to binding commitments ; the transition period for national content and trade balancing requirements lapses at the end of 1999 ; and export subsidies will no longer be permitted for most developing countries after 2003 .  
The negative connotation often attached to trade liberalization , in view of its risks for employment and incomes during transition , calls for increased international assistance and improved remedies and the continuous monitoring of the developmental impact of multilateral trade agreements .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , States Parties are encouraged to make , when necessary , appropriate bilateral or multilateral arrangements for using such special investigative techniques in the context of cooperation at the international level .

The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
Given the special difficulties faced by African countries in their effective participation in the multilateral trading system , the workshop held at Pretoria also addressed their specific concerns , taking into account the outcome of the Coordinating Workshop for Senior Advisers to Ministers of Trade of least developed countries in preparation for the WTO Ministerial Conference , held at Sun City , South Africa ( 21-25 June 1999 ) .  
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
The Ministers at Marrakech had also agreed to transmit a message to the WTO Conference in Seattle , demonstrating the G-77s determination to ensure that future multilateral trade initiatives would be focused on achieving a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the global trading system , improving conditions of access for developing country products and services in world markets and correcting imbalances in rights and obligations .  
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
This fellowship programme aims to give participants , in particular mid-level diplomats and national civil servants dealing with international issues , access to comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills , and possibly other related subjects .  
While considerable progress had been made towards the development of an open , non-discriminatory , secure , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system , much remained to be done ; his country , which was heavily dependent on foreign trade , had suffered greatly from the remaining inequities in the current system .  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Further improvement of the international debt strategy should be in line with the once and for all approach designed to reduce the overall stock of debt of the indebted countries and should include the adoption of an integrated approach to all types of indebtedness , including multilateral , bilateral and commercial debt .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Encourages multilateral institutions , Governments and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows ;  
As far as trade and finance was concerned , the forthcoming round of trade negotiations in the context of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) should be comprehensive and move the process of trade liberalization forward , strengthen the framework for the functioning of the multilateral trading system and ensure that the particular interests and concerns of developing countries were taken into account .  
In order to ensure that the benefits of globalization were enjoyed by all countries , rich and poor , it was essential to adopt and promote a multilateral approach by reshaping the current structure of the existing international institutions and their regulatory mechanisms . 
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
Renews the commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to continue to implement the programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .  
The proper place for paragraph 3 of article 19 is within the context of prevention at the international and not the national level , for the following reasons : firstly , this provision uses words such as States Parties shall cooperate , pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements , exchange information and coordinate administrative and other measures , which clearly indicate the international dimension of its subject matter .  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
It considered the important developments taking place within the global economic system , the accelerated pace of liberalization in the multilateral trading system and the increasing emergence of regional and international economic blocs .

Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows have presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
Renews the commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;

States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
This is weighty proof of the central role of our Organization as a unique mechanism for maintaining international peace and security , a universal forum for the development of multilateral cooperation and the practical embodiment of the concept of the multipolar nature of the modern world .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
The call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral resources for social development and the commitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance falls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the Copenhagen Summit .  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
We must take on the often difficult challenge of recognizing and addressing the intimate but complex links between both international and internal migration and other population and development issues.Canada is committed to continuing an active multilateral approach to migration which has as its cornerstone protection of the human rights of all migrants .  
Encourage the international community , including bilateral donors and multilateral development organizations , to assist developing countries in ensuring the provision of basic social services , including health-care services for women , in particular during periods of economic difficulty ; socially and gender-sensitive approaches to structural adjustment policies are further encouraged ;  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA flows , on the other hand , continued to be driven by and large by historical and geographical ties .  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
It was designed to analyse the present debate on the multilateral liberalization of trade and regional economic integration promoted by the European Union and the actions the World Trade Organization and UNCTAD intended to undertake to create an international economic setting oriented towards the economic integration of less industrialized countries .  
Renews its commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements , to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Eight Foreign Ministers of delegations represented in this Council Chamber came together on 9 June 1998 to issue a Joint Ministerial Declaration which contained the call for a new international agenda to achieve a nuclear _ weapon _ free world , through the pursuit , in parallel , of a series of mutually reinforcing measures at the bilateral , plurilateral and multilateral levels .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
It was the gradual receding of mutual suspicion and hostility , coupled with confidence-building , which helped to create an atmosphere conducive to commencing such bilateral and multilateral negotiations and concluding them successfully .  
We think that current international circumstances are conducive to the systematic and gradual attainment of this objective , which will require bilateral measures , measures involving various States and multilateral measures .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms , as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
The Bank and other agencies that play key roles in developing multilateral PPPs can not get too deeply involved in the internal control and supervision of national basic data collection in participating countries .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA , on the other hand , continued by and large to be driven by historical and geographical ties .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Participants recognized the important role played by migrants in their relations , and expressed determination to act , both at the multilateral and the bilateral level , to ensure that migrants from any country are treated in full compliance with human rights , basic freedoms and humanitarian principles .  
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
By the beginning of the new biennium , the Latin America and Caribbean region will be facing the challenge of reconciling economic globalization with regional integration agreements owing to the multiplicity of commitments , both bilateral and multilateral , entered into by numerous countries at the subregional , regional or hemispheric level .  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
His Government had provided a total of over US $ 2-billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral technical , scientific and economic cooperation to other developing countries and planned to extend its cooperation to include not only Asia and Africa , but also the South Pacific , the Caribbean and Central America and to promote the concept of multiple beneficiaries .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
To support and ensure effective follow-up to bilateral and multilateral initiatives , including regional and subregional consultation processes , where appropriate , to develop national policies and cooperative strategies to maximize the benefits and manage the challenges posed by international migration ;  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
He urged the international community to establish a rule-based , equitable and transparent multilateral trading system and said that he hoped that the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations would promote development , eliminate trade barriers against developing countries and increase preferential treatment to promote the financing of development through trade .  
There needed to be better coordination of the functions of existing multilateral organizations , bringing together the key international institutions and national authorities involved in preserving the stability of the financial sector and cooperating on policies to reduce systemic risk .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
Renews the commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Renews its commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Guatemala supported the establishment of a special task force to define that partnership , and believed that it should be composed of a dozen or so representatives of the Secretariat and the administration of the World Bank and IMF and their respective intergovernmental agencies and should focus on studying the limits within which the multilateral financial institutions could participate in activities , on the understanding that the final decision lay with Member States . 
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
The plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful nations to accept rational and realistic changes in the Security Council is a key indicator of the future of global multilateral relations in general and of this Organization in particular .  
We understand that it demands coordinated and concerted efforts on the multilateral level and requires a thorough study of the political , military and economic aspects , in particular States legitimate defence and security needs .  
Its members , who were all highly qualified and experienced in their specializations , understood the concerns of developing countries and appreciated what bilateral and multilateral donors required in project design , preparation and implementation .  
The overriding preoccupation in this regard is to ensure that emerging multilateral systems enable different national models of political , economic and social organization to function within a universally accepted framework of norms and rules .  
To that end , the currently unworkable international financial system should be converted into a rational and sound system , and the multilateral trading system should be reformed in order to make it equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory and predictable .  
While the Cologne debt initiative was a welcome step towards that goal , it must be accompanied by realistic , genuine debt relief measures such as the conversion into grants of any remaining official bilateral and multilateral debt .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
The social situation was further worsened by the reduction in public expenditures required to meet budget deficit parameters agreed with multilateral financial institutions .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Effective and meaningful collaborative efforts are required , involving Governments , multilateral development institutions , bilateral donors , the private sector , civil society and other relevant stakeholders , to enhance the developmental impact of ICT .  
In this regard , it recommended that creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions be encouraged to consider continuing the initiative and efforts to address commercial debt of heavily indebted African countries .  
The meeting , attended by representatives of global and regional multilateral environmental conventions , identified potential areas for collaboration among those conventions on topics such as assessment , trade and streamlining of national reporting .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
One of the main problems faced by local firms in the domestic market is securing effective and substantive participation in projects funded by multilateral funding agencies since they have found it difficult to meet the prequalification requirements .  
No less than some thirty conventions , multilateral agreements , uniform model laws or standard rules relating to international commercial dealings or international carriage are involved .  
Of critical importance is a fair , equitable and rulesbased multilateral trading system , operating in a nondiscriminatory , inclusive and transparent manner that provides benefits for all countries , especially developing countries .  
Exploring innovative sources for financing for development : considering innovative global instruments , including tax cooperation and global public goods financing mechanisms ; enhancing the contribution of multilateral development institutions , in particular the World Bank and regional development banks , in financial innovation in support of development ; promoting national and international public / private partnerships .  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
The international community is therefore invited to help my country to emerge from the crisis in which it finds itself by , among other things , participating in initiatives aimed at restoring lasting peace and resuming partnerships and bilateral and multilateral cooperation in accordance with our national development plans that will be formulated for the economic and social well-being of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
The definition and methodology lacked clarity , and the concept seemed more appropriate for a multinational corporation for which profit was paramount than for a multilateral international organization pursuing sensitive and complex political and socio-economic objectives agreed upon by consensus .  
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .  
For that reason his delegation had sponsored resolutions on the protection and security of small States in 1989 , 1991 and 1994 and remained convinced that a long-term solution to the problem required , among other things , the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to assist small States in protecting their security , sovereignty and territorial integrity in time of need .  Such assistance should be regarded as a political and moral obligation on the part of the international community .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
The recognition of special and differential treatments in favour of developing countries and an open , rule-based , transparent , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system are essential factors for a healthy global economic system .  
We stress that the major creditor countries should loosen their grip on the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture ; they should accept that representation in existing multilateral financial institutions should become broader and more balanced and that meaningful participation by developing countries in the decision-making processes , as well as greater transparency in such processes , should be ensured .  
Many delegations noted the necessity of an adequate replenishment of the multilateral fund of the Montreal Protocol , and emphasized that the implementation of the Protocol and its amendments would be strengthened through provision of additional financial resources to the fund , along with sound and affordable alternatives to ozone-depleting substances .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Emphasizing that at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , States undertook to promote multilateral , regional , subregional , and bilateral cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities to deal with criminal organizations involved in drug-related offences ,  
Recognizes , while bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , the importance of evaluating the impact of international financial , economic , monetary and multilateral trading systems on the enjoyment of human rights , while noting that issues such as those listed below are obstacles to the full realization of the right to development :  
The Programme was extended by the General Assembly in its resolution 2095 ( XX ) of 20 December 1965 , on a continuing basis for as long as multilateral food aid is found feasible and desirable , on the understanding that the Programme will be regularly reviewed before each pledging conference and that , if circumstances so require , it may be enlarged , curtailed or terminated at the end of any period for which resources have been pledged .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
IRU actively promotes the adoption and practical implementation of United Nations multilateral legal instruments on road transport in central and eastern Europe , in particular in newly independent States , as well as in Asia ; support and guidance to various EU aid projects on road transport .  It contributed to the elaboration of a draft revision of the European agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport and to discussion on a draft revision of the consolidated resolution on the facilitation of road transport ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Calls upon all States to take all appropriate national , bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent all forms of violence against children and to protect them from torture and other forms of violence , physical violence including domestic violence , child abuse , mental and sexual violence , abuse by the police and other law enforcement authorities or by employees in juvenile detention centres , orphanages , child care institutions and others , as well as violence in the street and in schools ;  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Executive Heads further recognized that , in order to contribute to progress in achieving the development and poverty eradication goals of the Millennium Summit , the system should strive , at the same time , not only to strengthen country level support but also to enhance policy coherence towards the creation of a more supportive international environment .  This implies contributing to reinforcing the role of the multilateral system in the management of globalization an objective that had found strong reaffirmation at the Summit and also strengthening policy coherence within the system itself .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
Urges developed country Parties to provide technical and financial assistance , as appropriate , through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative programmes to support the efforts of the Parties in implementing the programmes and measures identified in the annexed framework and to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention ;  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
In his view , the outcomes from the four expert meetings dealt with items which were both central elements of UNCTADs mandate as set out in the Bangkok Plan of Action , as well as constituting key issues on the international trade agenda and subject to intensive multilateral negotiation or review in the WTO .  
He said that the Meeting had been held against the background of the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture with two major objectives : ( i ) to clearly delineate those challenges and concerns that LDCs and NFIDCs faced during the Uruguay Round reform process in agriculture , and ( ii ) to examine how those concerns could be best addressed in the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations on agriculture .  
In the long term , the agricultural production base of developing countries should be improved , and in the short term , bilateral and multilateral food aid schemes should be strengthened .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
Although experts had expressed diverse views in the report , which demonstrated the difficulty in finding common solutions , the report and the Meeting had clearly indicated that UNCTADs analytical work in this area should continue and contribute to future multilateral trade negotiations , as well as to the definition of the national trade policy of individual countries .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
The recommendations called upon Governments to sign and ratify relevant international instruments on migrant workers ; develop bilateral and multilateral agreements with a view to raising awareness and ensuring the protection of the human rights of women migrant workers ; and to provide training to immigration , police and consular officers on the proper handling of cases of violence against women migrant workers .  
In our view , the Conference on Disarmament is a precious resource because , even in its current situation , it offers more space than any other forum for official multilateral dialogue on issues of concern .  Yet , questions are raised - for example , is the Conference on Disarmament a creature of the international security environment that awakes from its enforced hibernation only when there is adequate change in that environment ?  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
Belarus is convinced that a gradual movement from simple to more complex bilateral and multilateral measures and agreements will create a solid basis for preventing armed conflict and strengthening national and regional security , which in turn are integral elements of the modern architecture of a comprehensive and indivisible system of international security .  
But central to its success has been an organic sense of common purpose around which most operational and organizational questions revolve , and are resolved , with a minimum of fuss , by multilateral standards .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
He noted the Secretary-Generals recommendation that Governments should be urged to take steps to prepare a transparent , stable and predictable framework for investment and for building institutional infrastructures and that multilateral and bilateral donors should be encouraged to adopt suitable measures to permit faster and more extensive debt relief for poor countries .  
In that connection he stressed the need for an open , equitable , predictable , non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading system and expressed the hope that the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would achieve a new consensus model that took into account the needs and priorities of the developing world . 
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The complexity of managing East Timors public finances is compounded by the need to obtain donor support for the two primary trust funds ( the first funds the national budget , and the second supports capital investment and recovery ) , while coordinating other bilateral and multilateral development assistance .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
Reiterates its call upon all relevant funding institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as regional funding institutions and non-governmental organizations , to support , as appropriate , the efforts being made for the development of the renewable energy sector in developing countries on the basis of environment-friendly renewable sources of energy of demonstrated viability , while taking fully into account the development structure of energy-based economies of developing countries , and to assist in the attainment of the levels of investment necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
For that purpose , alliances have to be promoted between domestic and foreign enterprises of all sizes for the supply of services nationally and internationally ; a network of national and international companies supplying core and related energy services should be established ; and the energy strategy must be supported by Venezuelas active participation in the multilateral trade negotiation forums .  
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
Recalling the Millennium Declaration , which recognizes the special needs and problems of landlocked developing countries and urges both bilateral and multilateral donors to increase financial and technical assistance to this group of countries to meet their special development needs and to help them overcome the impediments of geography by improving their transit transport systems ,  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to continue to work closely with the World Trade Organization and other relevant multilateral institutions in the provision of technical assistance to African countries , in particular the least developed among them , so as to enhance their capacity to overcome technical barriers to trade in industrial and other products , including improving quality standards to alleviate supply-side constraints , and to promote industrial competitiveness within the context of the integrated framework initiative in order to enable them to integrate fully into the world economy ;  
Reiterates its call upon all relevant funding institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as regional funding institutions and non-governmental organizations , to support , as appropriate , the efforts being made for the development of the renewable energy sector in developing countries on the basis of environment-friendly renewable sources of energy of demonstrated viability , while taking fully into account the development structure of energy-based economies of developing countries , and to assist in the attainment of the levels of investment necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

With regard to trade and environment , the World Trade Organization has agreed to negotiations on the relationship between existing World Trade Organization rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , 13 procedures for regular information exchange between MEA secretariats and the relevant World Trade Organization committees , and the reduction or , as appropriate , elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services .  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
An increase in the resources of the Global Environment Facility to match the level of official assistance to developing countries , in view of the Facilitys important role as a basic financing tool for environmental and development activities ; the allocation of more resources to assistance in the implementation of programmes under the relevant multilateral conventions ; the granting of fair and equal opportunities to all developing countries to take advantage of the Facility ; and the simplification of procedures for obtaining from it financing for sustainable development projects ;  
The improvement of the access to international markets of products from countries affected by the phenomena of slavery , servitude and colonization , including the development and implementation of special and differential treatment in respect of the length of the adjustment periods in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that would establish a more equitable and supportive international trade environment for States that are populated substantially by people of African descent and indigenous peoples ;  
The practice of the half century since World War II has proven that the moves of GATT and the WTO in achieving big multilateral reductions in tariffs and nontariff measures , actively spurring the liberalization of international trade , enhancing the transparency of members ' trade policies , resolving trade disputes , and accepting large numbers of developing countries and regions to take part in the multilateral trade setup have played an extremely important role in expanding international trade and promoting world economic development .  
The Bangkok Declaration emphasized the necessity of establishing a fair and regular " multilateral trade system " and operating in a nondiscriminating and transparent way , which would be conducive to all the countries , the developing ones in particular .  
We must speed up the training of a number of specialized talented personnel who are familiar with China 's national condition , who have a good command of foreign languages , plenty of specialized knowledge , and who understand WTO regulations and international economic laws , to master and apply basic WTO knowledge and regulations , effectively participate in drawing up international trade regulations , and make full use of the multilateral regulations and international conventions to develop our foreign trade and preserve our legitimate interests .  
Being the largest multilateral economic organization for the standardized international economic and trade rules in the contemporary world , the WTO has formulated and implemented a complete set of multilateral trade rules with a very extensive coverage , which almost involve all facets of the contemporary world 's economy and trade and have legal effect and standards .  
The DPRK 's active efforts to push its multilateral diplomacy , increase exchanges with other countries of the world , create a peaceful and stable environment on the Korean peninsula , launch foreign trade and economic cooperation , and speed up domestic economic construction are beneficial .  
The United States also believes that , looking at the balance of forces in the Asia-Pacific region , the western forces headed by itself are overwhelmingly superior , and so the present moment is an excellent opportunity for establishing a constraining multilateral security mechanism under its own control , capable of resolving substantive problems .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
Despite the past 50 years and especially the last 10 since the end of the Cold War , the international environment the US faces has undergone tremendous changes but the " support system " the US established and runs has not changed .  Post-Cold War economic and military conflicts between the US and European Union have not caused any bilateral or multilateral damage .  
It has thoroughly given up the practice of either leaning toward the West or confronting the West , but has adopted an omnidirectional foreign strategy of conducting dialogue , laying equal stress on relations with the East and the West , developing relations with big powers , and strengthening bilateral or multilateral relations with other countries , aimed at protecting its national interests , particularly economic interests .  
Today , as the world moves toward globalization , and more and more nations are resolving international disputes through international institutions or multilateral diplomacy , the American style of wantonly engaging in military ventures is a bit ironic : a great nation that promotes globalization , the nation with the most speaking privileges in the world 's largest international institutions displaying this kind of outdated militaristic view of national security and unilateralism in its diplomacy that rejects multilateral negotiations !  
After our WTO entry , China , as a member country of the World Trade Organization , will enjoy multilateral , unconditional and stable most-favored nation treatment .  When we become involved in a trade dispute involving agriculture products , we can rely on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to reach a more fair and reasonable solution , and this will reduce such unfair treatment as non-tariff restrictions aimed at Chinese agricultural exports by other countries .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
The United States has shown contempt for international multilateral or bilateral agreements , obstructed international efforts to cut greenhouse gas emission , announced at the end of March that it would not ratify the " Kyoto Protocol , " single-mindedly wanted to develop and deploy the National Missile Defense system in disregard of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " signed in 1972 with the Soviet Union .  
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
The institute 's objective is : On the basis of the country 's basic national policy of carrying out reforms , opening up to the outside world , and building a market economic system , it will serve China 's modernization drive by engaging in comprehensive studies of WTO-based multilateral trade systems and international issues about economic integration , globalization , and economic and trade policies of all countries .  
Xiang Huaicheng told Chinese reporters in an exclusive interview that during their visit to Germany , China and Germany completely agreed that both countries shared an extensive consensus on many major international financial and monetary issues ; and the two countries should continue stepping up cooperation in multilateral international institutions and forums , including the IMF , the World Bank , as well as the 20-Nation Group and the Asian-European Financial Ministers ' Conference . Meanwhile , the two countries should also further expand mutual financial and economic exchanges .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Senior officials exchanged views on the possible elements that may be included in the new round of WTO talks and some specific initiatives raised by member economies , pointing out that a balanced agenda should be facilitated for the multilateral trade talks in order to benefit all member economies , especially the developing economies , through a multilateral trading system .  
Not only is a new round of multilateral trade talks a major issue that concerns all countries today , but APEC 's 21 APEC member nations account for about half of world trade and half of the global economy .  Their voice has a decisive role on the international economic stage .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
The ministers unanimously held that it is necessary to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation , push forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation within APEC , and step up economic and technical cooperation in order to meet challenges of the new century with practical action .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
The ministers reaffirmed the statement of the Brunei Ministerial Conference and Informal Leadership Meeting on launching a new round of multilateral trade talks in 2001 , held that the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in November in Qatar represents a critical opportunity for the launch of a new round of WTO talks and that it is necessary to accelerate WTO work , speedily formulate a balanced , operational , broad-based agenda for the talks , and expressed particular concern for the interests of developing members .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
For this purpose , President Jiang put forward four proposals , namely , " replenishing and developing the ' Shanghai Five ' mechanism " , " deepening cooperation in the security field , " " advancing bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation " , and " strengthening cooperation on the international stage " .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
It stands for extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange to put peace and security on a more solid foundation .  " Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
At the fifth " Shanghai Five " summit held in July 2000 in Dushanbe , leaders of the member states reiterated their determination to " jointly combat such international criminal activities that contribute the most threats to the region 's security , stability and development such as ethnic separatism , religious extremism , international terrorism , illegal arms smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal migration . "  It also proposed to sign treaties and pacts on multilateral cooperation among the member states .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .

As compared with the period of the Clinton Administration that attached importance to multilateral cooperation , the Bush Administration regards multilateral agreements more as restricting the freedom of movement of the United States . It carries a strong color of unilateralism , judges everything by the yardstick of the " supreme national interests of the United States , " and ignores its international obligations .  
He said : Although the Protocol negotiations are now suffering a serious setback , the Chinese side remains convinced that a balanced and effective protocol concluded through multilateral negotiations is not only beneficial to various signatories to the Convention but is also conducive to world peace and security .  As always , the Chinese side will join the various sides in making unrelenting efforts for the realization the common objective of strengthening the effectiveness of the Convention in comprehensive manner .  
Wu Hailong said that this year the APEC meeting discussed in depth trade and investment liberalization , strengthening of a multilateral trade structure , economic and technological cooperation , exploitation of human resources , and new economies , among other issues .

The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation . "

They are willing to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and work to build a just and rational international political and economic new order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The foreign ministers of the five countries express their deep worry over the increasingly rampant activities of the forces of national separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .  They hold that those forces are the main threat to regional security and stability and it is necessary to tackle the situation through strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation , including the signing of related treaties and agreements by the " five countries . "  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .

They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
In the face of such a new situation , ever since last year , the DPRK has been taking active steps to readjust its foreign policies .

Once the NMD system is deployed , the results in bilateral and multilateral disarmament and arms control obtained over the past several years will be destroyed in one day .  With the destruction of global strategic stability , unilateralism in international relations will increase .  There will be more unstable factors in both global and regional security .  
The statement calls on various countries to painstakingly contribute to maintaining the situation of world and regional security , establish a new international political and economic order , quicken the tempo of multilateral international trade and the opening up of regional organizations , intensify the economic and financial cooperation and scientific and technological exchanges between the two continents in the era of information , and so on .  
Gore seemed to lay greater stress on establishing an Asia-Pacific multilateral security mechanism and attach greater importance to the US ' relations with China , but he stressed that Japan was the US ' principal ally in Asia .

Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .

Grenada is encouraged by the new spirit of international cooperation built on a shared partnership between multilateral financial institutions and Governments .  
While we seek to put in place all the necessary measures to ensure the efficient and effective management of our domestic affairs , we strongly urge multilateral institutions to include in these models for development a component that provides skills training and , in particular , training in the use of technologies to enable young people to find productive employment in the private sector and to facilitate the process towards equitable social and economic development .  
Today 's world dialectically combines within itself both dangers and threats fraught with instability and the risk of new global shocks , while nourishing the growth of an essentially new and different non-confrontational system of international relations .  Through ever more active multilateral efforts in confronting common challenges , we see more clearly the basic principles of such a system .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
Effective economic cooperation between the countries of the Middle East can be called , without fear of exaggeration , a main component of lasting peace and an essential condition for the development of mutually beneficial and harmonious bilateral and multilateral dialogue .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
An earlier report of the Secretary-General ( A / 45 / 274-E / 1990 / 73 and Corr . 1 ) , submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session through the Economic and Social Council , had stressed the need to adopt comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures in order to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , including new and renewable sources of energy .  
The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
It also confirms our belief in how much can be accomplished through multilateral action if the mandates set by the Council are achievable , the time-frames remain realistic , our approach is flexible and the commitment to peace among the parties involved is genuine .  
Urges all Governments , competent regional economic integration organizations and the executive heads of the competent specialized agencies and of other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system to continue to present their views to the Secretary-General on institutional developments related to the strengthening of international organizations in the area of multilateral trade ;  
Governments increasingly recognize that their responses to changing circumstances and their desires to achieve sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity , expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Promoting enterprise and productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule based international trading system and technologies for all people , particularly those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as the least developed countries ;  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
All the main multilateral banks emphasize the need for forest-sector investment lending to be preceded by strong sectoral analysis , policy dialogue and institutional reform , including taking steps to improve regulatory and legal frameworks in forestry and to integrate sector aims and objectives with wider economic and environmental concerns .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
They also welcomed the fact that the draft articles provided explicit rules under which watercourse States were entitled to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements , tailored to their specific needs , provided that they respected the general principles set forth in the articles .  
China hoped that the United States of America and the Russian Federation would implement existing nuclear-disarmament treaties as scheduled and carry out further drastic cuts in their respective nuclear arsenals , thereby creating the necessary conditions for the commencement of multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States in order to conclude a convention on the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
For these reasons , many non-nuclear-weapon States continued to express strong preference for a multilateral , legally binding international accord , which would be equal in status to the obligations contained in the non-proliferation Treaty .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
On 4 October 1994 , the Governments of China and of the United States issued a joint statement whereby the two Governments agreed to work together to promote the earliest possible achievement of a multilateral , non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Despite the cyclical fall in contributions to multilateral institutions , developing countries ' receipts from this source were cushioned to some extent by the fact that the multilateral institutions , especially the international financial institutions , can draw on income from previous years to make their current disbursements .  
Replenishments in 1994 should refurbish multilateral commitment potential if the familiar cyclical pattern holds up , but if adequate funds are not forthcoming from donors , the level of the activities of the multilateral agencies could be impaired in later years .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
Effective investigation and prosecution at the national level and close bilateral and multilateral cooperation by countries around the world is essential to addressing the grave problems caused by ongoing criminal enterprises .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In response , the Special Unit has prepared a report which contains a number of recommendations designed to promote and implement a more strategic approach to technical cooperation among developing countries in an effort to make it a dynamic instrument in support of development in the context of the changing realities of multilateral development cooperation .  
Recalling that a reappraisal of the 1921 principle , on which common system remuneration is based , was long overdue , ACC reiterated its concern that the current remuneration system was outdated and needed to be overhauled to become competitive with bilateral and other multilateral financial and aid agencies . 
A provision of $ 58,100 would be required to hire consultants ( $ 24,700 ) to provide specialized inputs for documents related to regional repercussions of bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements , taking into account the evolution of environmental policies and changing production patterns in the housing and urban infrastructure construction sector , including proposals for its modernization , and ( $ 33,400 ) for the convening of three ad hoc expert group meetings .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
Several delegations stressed the need to ensure adequate resources for strengthening activities under programme 12 pertaining to the continuing economic and social transformation in countries with economies in transition and the reporting to the General Assembly and to the Security Council on the implementation of multilateral economic sanctions on the effects of unilateral economic coercive measures .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
Also , in this regard , following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ( April 1994 ) , which included agriculture for the first time in a substantive fashion , there has been a growing interest by developing countries in coming to grips with the changed international trading environment for agriculture and FAO has been developing a programme to respond to this need .  
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
The succession of reciprocal vetoes , the sharpness of the exchanges , the modest scope of many of its resolutions and , above all , its silences in the face of serious crises which affected international peace and security reflected the narrow margin for action available to the Council and the United Nations when set against an overwhelming strategic struggle which shattered the hope for any multilateral solution . 
But when the time comes to negotiate multilateral replenishments , additional multilateral resources are seen as coming at the expense of already stretched bilateral programmes , which are usually perceived to bring political benefits or to respond more closely to donor Government policies and priorities , since the donor itself is responsible for their supervision and control .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
It should give participants access to a comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law enforcement , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills .  
NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
We want to generate broad support for an improved global multilateral system , based upon a renewed political will of all Member States , and which draws on the energies and the commitment of independent organizations of civil society .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
From that standpoint , high priority should be given to implementation of actions such as explicit incorporation of the aid targets and commitments of the Programme of Action in the donors ' aid budgets , increase in the level of concessional multilateral assistance , operationalization of additional flows to social sector , environmental conservation and eradication of poverty and enhancement of the value of aid through improving aid quality .  
That this serious problem should necessitate strengthened efforts on the international debt strategy was acknowledged at the mid-term review , and a number of actions were agreed upon in the areas of official bilateral debt , multilateral debt , and commercial debt .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Recommendation 1 : Wherever United Nations system organizations desire to enhance cooperative relationships with the multilateral financial institutions , their executive heads and the governing bodies responsible for operational activities for development should make a meaningful commitment to increase the competitiveness of their programmes .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
was important to recognize that security was no longer defined as it had been in the cold war era : security was currently threatened by socio-economic problems - massive migrations , global epidemics and environmental degradation - which could only be resolved in the interest of all countries by multilateral action .  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;

the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing countries ,  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 27 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
addition , being aware of the need for concerted efforts on the part of all States , Belarus was actively developing its bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the fight against crime and had already signed , or was preparing to sign , agreements on the subject with various countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and others in Eastern and Western Europe .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
SRIWIDJAJA ( Indonesia ) said it was vital that the jurisdiction of the international criminal court should be universally accepted , and he concurred with the view that the court should be established as an independent judicial organ by means of a multilateral treaty , as recommended by the International Law Commission .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;

Fourth , disbursements of official development finance ( ODF ) fell : concessional disbursements of official development assistance ( ODA ) rose in both nominal and real terms , but multilateral net lending on non-concessional terms dropped substantially and bilateral net lending on non-concessional terms rose only slightly .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Emphasizes the serious debt problems of the least developed countries , which necessitate strengthened efforts to formulate an international debt strategy that should include concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden and increased concessional financing in support of appropriate economic policy measures , which will be critical to the revitalization of the growth and development of the least developed countries , and encourages the Bretton Woods institutions to expedite the ongoing consideration of ways to address the issue of multilateral debt , including those concerning the least developed countries ;

In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Continue to support the role of multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies in the provision of structured finance including loans and equity ; senior lender guarantees ; political risk insurance and re-insurance ; in the development of small supporting businesses , through soft loans ; and in the development of internal financial institutions through loans and guarantees and the introduction of stock exchanges etc .  
Besides encouraging States to become parties to the 1988 Convention , to enact financial legislation that did not run counter to the guidelines of FATF , and to increase multilateral cooperation in investigations and prosecutions , the recommendations focused on the improvement of national legal systems to combat money-laundering , the enhancement of the role of the financial system , understood in its broadest sense , and the strengthening of international cooperation .  
In addition , the Council invited Member States to cooperate in that regard , with a view to encouraging progressive alignment regarding , inter alia , international cooperation , extradition and other bilateral and multilateral modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters and requested the Secretary-General to report thereon to the Commission at its fifth session .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
Both sides will make efforts and cooperate with other countries for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , value the speedy coming into effect of the Chemical Weapons Convention and call for accelerated progress in further improving the effectiveness of the Biological Weapons Convention . The two sides are ready to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation on effective and responsible oversight of transfers of conventional weapons , particularly to regions of conflict .  
The general orientation of this programme is to promote more effective international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice by devising strategies to deal with global problems and by assisting Governments in their national and multilateral efforts to respond to changing crime trends , as well as to create the necessary instruments and institutions for a more accountable , transparent and effective crime prevention and control system .  
To promote the fundamental principles of maintenance of the rule of law and good governance and to increase the capacity of States to devise and implement effective , integrated and consolidated strategies and measures at the national level , and to put into effect bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels .  
This will result in an increase in bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels , together with the promulgation of more effective strategies and measures at the national level to deal with sophisticated forms of crime ;  
The space research activities in Morocco , related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring , were characterized by an active , realistic and long-term policy at both the national level ( coordination , information , training and project formulation ) and the international level ( participation in forums , international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects ) .  
By providing a unique platform for dialogue , the United Nations helps to articulate shared values , enhance common understanding , elaborate multilateral agreements on norms and standards , and promote practical cooperation on a broad range of issues ;  
Interested developed and developing country partners should reflect their mutual commitment by allocating , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance , including contributions through multilateral organizations and non-governmental organizations and 20 per cent of the national budgets ( net of aid ) , respectively , to basic social services , as soon as possible and preferably by the year 2000 .  
The meeting invited interested developing countries and donor Governments and multilateral organizations to review policy frameworks , plans of action and basic social services programmes , with identified national and external financing requirements , in all appropriate forums , in particular consultative group and round-table meetings .  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
In its decision 96 / 15 , entitled " Allocation of resources to country programmes of the United Nations Population Fund " , the Executive Board reaffirmed that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there was a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources .  
Furthermore , while some countries apply the principle of the total programme approach and national execution to all sources / projects of technical cooperation , in most countries existing NEX development planning structures / procedures do not provide for the integration of activities other than those falling strictly within the UNDP country programme ( excluding , for example , projects executed through bilateral aid , development financing institutions , multilateral organizations , trust funds and so forth ) .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .

To achieve an overview of the relevance of existing international legal instruments to the conservation , management and sustainable use of all types of forests and their relation to issues on the global forest agenda , the present report provides a comprehensive summary of multilateral instruments that are relevant to forest use and conservation .  
It should also focus on improved cooperation and implementation by national Governments of bilateral and multilateral forest-related planning activities and programmes , and the use of national-level participatory approaches to that end . "  The Panel also decided to schedule programme element I . 1 for initial discussion at its second session ( Geneva , 11-22 March 1996 ) , and for substantive discussion at its third session ( Geneva , 9-20 September 1996 ) .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .  
" The Argentine Republic is convinced that the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would be a crucial event in fostering international trust , because it would strengthen the growing conviction that nuclear weapons are of no use for the security of nations , and would facilitate the future agenda and the negotiation of other multilateral measures regarding disarmament , non-proliferation and arms control . "  Charg d'affaires a.i .

Also reaffirms that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there is a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , and calls upon those countries in a position to do so to increase their contributions to the United Nations Population Fund ;  
As emphasized earlier , in the delicate conditions prevalent in new and restored democracies , there is a need to coordinate what may otherwise be disjointed actions of non-governmental organizations not only with governmental plans , but also with assistance provided by bilateral donors and multilateral organizations . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
To inform , to educate and to generate public understanding of the importance of and support for multilateral action , including action by the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament , in the field of arms limitation and disarmament , in a factual , balanced and objective manner , particularly through the continuing publication in all official languages of The United Nations Disarmament Yearbook and the Disarmament Review , as well as the updating of the Status of Multilateral Arms Regulation and Disarmament Agreements ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
At a time when profound changes are taking place in the international arena and the United Nations is being increasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not always conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all Member States , regardless of size , geographical situation or economic and military might , it is vital that a broad programme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral institutions be adopted to further measures , in a decisive manner , for the democratization of international relations based on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States .  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Establishing a central repository for three categories of information and documentation , namely , ( i ) national legislation , including regulatory measures ; ( ii ) organizational structures ; and ( iii ) international cooperation arrangements , including bilateral and multilateral treaties , and implementing legislation , with a view to making the collected data available to Member States upon request . 
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action , taking into account internationally recognized norms and standards ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The IOM budget is composed of an administrative part , funded by assessed contributions from all member States according to an agreed percentage scale and an operational part funded wholly by voluntary contributions from Governments and multilateral and private sources .  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled " Macroeconomic policy questions " ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
Like other members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , his country supported the concept of a rapidly deployable headquarters team and emphasized the importance of such a team being set up in a transparent manner , bearing in mind the multilateral character of the Organization and the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations as it pertained to the independence of the staff and to equitable geographical distribution . 
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action , taking into account internationally recognized norms and standards ;  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
With respect to article 40 , paragraph 2 , please indicate the relevant international instruments applicable in the area of the administration of juvenile justice , including at the multilateral , regional or bilateral levels , as well as legislative and other appropriate measures adopted to ensure in particular that :  
Relevant bilateral , regional and multilateral agreements concluded or to which the State party may have acceded to foster the prevention of all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation and to ensure the effective protection of child victims , including in the areas of judicial cooperation and cooperation among law enforcement officials ;  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
" Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
" Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
To inform , to educate and to generate public understanding of the importance of and support for multilateral action , including action by the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament , in the field of arms limitation and disarmament , in a factual , balanced and objective manner , in particular through the continuing publication in all official languages of The United Nations Disarmament Yearbook and the Disarmament Periodical , and the updating of the Status of Multilateral Arms Regulation and Disarmament Agreements ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
He was delighted to see that UNCTAD activities which were of importance to his country - such as assistance to developing and transitional economies in integrating into the international trade system , restrictive business practices and competition issues , trade in services , the interrelationship between trade and environment , and the impact of economic regionalization on the multilateral trade system - were duly reflected .  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
With regard to the fact that the rules on reservations to multilateral treaties had been elaborated with the purpose of reconciling two sets of interests ( the need to ensure the universality of a treaty by maximizing participation by States with diverse cultural , economic and political conditions , and the need to preserve the integrity of the treaty ) , it became evident that universality should not only be numerical but also substantive .  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled ' Macroeconomic policy questions ' ;  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
It is indisputably one of the major achievements of the United Nations and has come to be regarded as a multilateral instrument that holds out great promise and vast potential for the maintenance of peace , an equitable basis for sharing the resources of the world 's oceans and a means for securing economic and social progress for all the peoples of the Earth .  
At the same time , the Panel acknowledged that at present no single multilateral body , organization or instrument has either a mandate or the capacity to address , in a balanced , [ integrated ] [ holistic ] and mutually reinforcing way , all forest-related issues currently on the international agenda on sustainable forest management .  
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
In its foreign relations , Viet Nam will constantly pursue an open foreign policy of independence , diversification and the promotion of multilateral relations along the line of gradual regional and international integration , thus making worthy contributions to the cause of peace , national independence , democracy and social progress .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
Indeed , it is in recognition of the critical importance of the success of this peace process to achieve durable peace in the Middle East that Japan has been actively participating in the peace process by engaging in intensified dialogue with the parties directly concerned , by sending its own contingents to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region , and by offering its active contribution to the multilateral talks on the Middle East launched in Madrid in 1991 .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
As a direct consequence of recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) in 1994 , more than a dozen multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies began discussions leading to the formation of the " Urban Forum " , to serve as a vehicle for information exchange , and joint programming in the field of sustainable human settlements development .  
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
It is recognized , however , that the responsibility for coordinating external assistance , from multilateral , bilateral or other international organizations , rests first and foremost with the Government concerned .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
Statements were made that judicial cooperation in general , including cooperation in insolvency matters , was governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties , which typically provided for cooperation based on reciprocity .  For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
With regard to bilateral and multilateral treaties , the five States reported that they had signed a significant number of treaties concerning the protection of the environment , some of which contained penal provisions , and had implemented them in national legislation .  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
In particular , such provisions could invite States , in accordance with or subject to their domestic laws or pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements : ( a ) to take all appropriate measures to prevent preparation in their respective territories for the commission of those offences outside their territories ; ( b ) to exchange information in accordance with their national law ; and ( c ) to coordinate administrative and other measures to be taken , as appropriate , to prevent the commission of offences set forth in the convention .  
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
The Conference welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and hoped that it would be reinforced by additional bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce the debt stock of all African countries .  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
Several Governments have reported efforts to eradicate the illicit cultivation of narcotic plants , and countries in which such illicit cultivation remains a problem have sought international assistance through bilateral or multilateral agreements to implement alternative development programmes .  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
The High Contracting Parties , attaching importance to stable development and the effective exploitation of the economic potential of both States , shall cooperate in implementing the ongoing economic reforms on the basis of market relations , promote the intensification of economic integration between the two States , and create conditions for the establishment of a common economic space in accordance with their obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements concluded by the High Contracting Parties within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Requests all concerned organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the regional commissions and other relevant international and multilateral institutions , to make , within their respective fields of competence , substantive contributions and proposals for further action as submissions to the preparatory process of the Conference ;  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The Parties believe that it is essential to continue to make joint coordinated efforts with a view to establishing , in the area within the purview of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , bilateral and multilateral international relations based on the generally accepted principles and norms of international law ;  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .  
The Commission encouraged the Secretariat to devise ways to address the continuing and significant increase in the importance being attributed by Governments , by domestic and international business communities and by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to improving the legal framework for international trade and investment .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
On the contrary , it means adjusting these lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world and also making the Organization no matter how different its separate parts are the mainstream of human development , where the economic well-being of people brings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and epidemic diseases , as well as huge environmental threats , and which helps to achieve multilateral understanding between those participating in this development .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
The sponsors are submitting these three draft resolutions driven by a strong desire that the Organization should make a further concrete and constructive contribution to the multiplicity of efforts bilateral , multilateral or undertaken by individuals or by Governments aimed at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine .  
This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process , particularly on the bilateral tracks , and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
The cold war had just ended , and barriers both real and perceived were falling , paving the way for precisely this type of treaty negotiated on a multilateral basis , as opposed to the bipolar accords with which the world was more familiar .  
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
This multifaceted process of sustainable development necessitates constant and close multilateral cooperation as well as concerted efforts on a regional and national basis .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
IMO forwarded a document entitled " Status of international conventions relating to marine pollution of which IMO is depositary or responsible for secretariat duties " , which provided information of relevance to the issues of concluded bilateral and multilateral treaties , including legislation to ensure their implementation , and information on the status of implementation of international conventions at the national level .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
If there is a sense that a dynamic and genuinely interactive process is under way , involving progress at both bilateral and multilateral levels , we are convinced that wide international support will be forthcoming .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
All the while , a core of supporting multilateral agencies , despite severe financial constraints , have provided some of the required support and sought together , in a pragmatic manner , to identify their comparative advantages in responding to the countries ' perceived needs and in identifying the respective areas of complementarity .  
The central themes of the discussions were the following : the promotion of cooperation in law enforcement and the exchange of information on drug traffickers ; harmonization of various bilateral , multilateral and regional approaches to controlling substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the legislative frameworks , so as to facilitate the worldwide exchange of information on suspicious transactions involving such substances ; and the eradication of illicit crops and the development of programmes to advance crop substitution and alternative development projects .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
Provision of specialized data and information products and services in computer-generated formats on the status of the Convention and the related Agreements ; bilateral and multilateral treaties and other legal instruments ; national legislation ; charts and geographical coordinates of maritime zones ; the limits of the continental shelf ; and national maritime profile ;  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
Because multilateral funding is declining and there is a tendency to become more dependent on directed multilateral contributions , WFP is intensifying its efforts to secure resources at the field level by ensuring that donor representatives are well informed of WFP activities and by broadening its donor base for the long term .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
In particular , it was assisting the national commission to combat illicit drug use in its coordination activities and had amended its organic law on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances of 1993 to make it more compatible with the multilateral mechanisms in existence .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
With regard to the external debt , the initiatives taken by the Bretton Woods institutions and creditor countries to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and to find solutions to multilateral debt were insufficient and of limited scope , and the situation of middle-income countries which met their obligations promptly and in full was likewise unresolved ; hence a comprehensive and radical solution to the debt problem must be found .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
Despite its political will to carry out the necessary reforms , the Cambodian Government continued to face two major obstacles : the enormous bilateral and multilateral debt , which constituted a heavy burden on the Government , and poorer access to markets and deteriorating terms of trade .  
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
One major initiative , of which UNDP was one of the main supporters , was the Micro-credit Summit held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 , which brought together 2,500 participants from more than 100 countries , including beneficiaries of micro-finance programmes , organizers of micro-credit projects , commercial and development banks , non-governmental organizations , multilateral and bilateral donors , as well as heads of Government and senior officials who were heads of small business promotional institutions . 
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
In extreme cases , where coercive economic measures are most likely to have important long-term effects , such measures are usually multilateral , comprehensive in scope , extensive in duration and also frequently coincide with civil or other military conflict that also thwarts economic development .  
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
The expert group agreed that the problems raised by the imposition of coercive economic measures , including their economic , social , political and legal aspects , deserve increased attention by the international community and multilateral bodies .  
Although these States are responsible for their future , the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa demand a multilateral response to the political , economic and social ills of the region , and the need to address development issues is paramount .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
As Member States and international multilateral organizations pondered such policies , at a minimum those policies must be balanced between rights and legal obligations ; be technologically feasible and economically reasonable ; and be technologically effective .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
Looking forward to when we come to the practical realization of the ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons , multilateral negotiations on an international agreement on the subject will obviously also become essential .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
Wide areas such as rules of origin in autonomous or contractual preferential agreements remain , as far as the multilateral system is concerned , under soft law regulations and not guided by common disciplines .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
That concept remained valid and relevant and was likely to assume additional importance in the light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .  
The AG13 , having considered a proposal from the Chairman , decided to adopt the framework of the multilateral consultative process , set out in annex II below , subject to the matters contained in square brackets in its paragraphs 8 and 9 .

It is Japans fundamental view that the primary objective of any effort to codify a multilateral treaty on State responsibility is to provide an effective legal framework for the resolution of international disputes on that subject .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
Despite the efforts of the affected countries and the intervention of the multilateral financial institutions , the crisis had not abated and the potential consequences for those countries included a reduced rate of liberalization ; the possibility that they might seriously consider defaulting on their debt ; the contraction of expenditure , which inevitably meant reduced spending on social services ; and the possibility of widespread social and political upheaval .  
Since its establishment by the General Assembly in 1963 , it had advised United Nations bodies , the national institutions of Member States and non-governmental organizations through training programmes in a variety of disciplines ( multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management , peacemaking and preventive diplomacy , environmental law , migration policy and law , capacity-building in the field of economic and social development ) .  
On this point some delegations expressed preference for a framework convention , arguing that States would be bound by the provisions of such an instrument without losing the freedom to conclude more detailed bilateral or multilateral agreements with respect to specific hazardous or harmful activities or geographical regions with a high concentration of such activities .  
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .  
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
With regard to the international agenda , the pro tempore President of MERCOSUR called for due attention to be paid to existing economic , political and strategic commitments , which should be analysed realistically and objectively in the light of potential costs and benefits which may be generated by either multilateral or bilateral negotiations .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .  
At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
the substantive discussion of nuclear disarmament issues through which the international community can be better informed on a continuing basis , can express its views as to the process , and can identify issues which might be subject to multilateral negotiations .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
b .  Reports on State practice , including national legislation , bilateral and multilateral treaties as well as decisions of international judicial bodies related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs ; c .

As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
Moreover , the growth of TCDC can be measured not only through the number and range of TCDC-related projects completed or ongoing but also by the spread of new TCDC configurations , including a sharp increase in country-to-country bilateral TCDC projects , the recent phenomenon of donor country involvement in triangular funding schemes , and the proliferation of partnerships among intergovernmental organizations , non-governmental organizations and other players within the multilateral system .  
The objectives of the report were to make UNU an integral part of the United Nations renewal process ; to explore ways by which its potential could be realized more fully as a strategic intellectual resource for the multilateral system of cooperation ; and to strengthen its adaptability to the emerging or uncharted challenges of the next century .  
In this connection , UNIDO has combined its unique technical and sectoral expertise with technical cooperation provided by other multilateral and bilateral agencies to enhance technological upgrading of industry and facilitate the adoption of production processes consistent with new global standards for quality , cleaner production and energy efficiency in small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) .

It is therefore of utmost importance to recognize that responses to those changing circumstances and the achievement of sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity and exchange of ideas and information expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .

With this in mind , educational and training activities should be strengthened and supported by bilateral and multilateral programmes adapted to domestic needs , which should also consider the strenghthening of such as the regional training centres for space science and technology education established with the assistance of the United Nations .  
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries .

The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .

The call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral resources for social development and the commitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance falls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the Copenhagen Summit .  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .

We must take on the often difficult challenge of recognizing and addressing the intimate but complex links between both international and internal migration and other population and development issues.Canada is committed to continuing an active multilateral approach to migration which has as its cornerstone protection of the human rights of all migrants .  
Encourage the international community , including bilateral donors and multilateral development organizations , to assist developing countries in ensuring the provision of basic social services , including health-care services for women , in particular during periods of economic difficulty ; socially and gender-sensitive approaches to structural adjustment policies are further encouraged ;  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA flows , on the other hand , continued to be driven by and large by historical and geographical ties .  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
It was designed to analyse the present debate on the multilateral liberalization of trade and regional economic integration promoted by the European Union and the actions the World Trade Organization and UNCTAD intended to undertake to create an international economic setting oriented towards the economic integration of less industrialized countries .  
Renews its commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements , to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Eight Foreign Ministers of delegations represented in this Council Chamber came together on 9 June 1998 to issue a Joint Ministerial Declaration which contained the call for a new international agenda to achieve a nuclear _ weapon _ free world , through the pursuit , in parallel , of a series of mutually reinforcing measures at the bilateral , plurilateral and multilateral levels .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
It was the gradual receding of mutual suspicion and hostility , coupled with confidence-building , which helped to create an atmosphere conducive to commencing such bilateral and multilateral negotiations and concluding them successfully .  
We think that current international circumstances are conducive to the systematic and gradual attainment of this objective , which will require bilateral measures , measures involving various States and multilateral measures .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms , as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
The Bank and other agencies that play key roles in developing multilateral PPPs can not get too deeply involved in the internal control and supervision of national basic data collection in participating countries .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA , on the other hand , continued by and large to be driven by historical and geographical ties .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Participants recognized the important role played by migrants in their relations , and expressed determination to act , both at the multilateral and the bilateral level , to ensure that migrants from any country are treated in full compliance with human rights , basic freedoms and humanitarian principles .  
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
By the beginning of the new biennium , the Latin America and Caribbean region will be facing the challenge of reconciling economic globalization with regional integration agreements owing to the multiplicity of commitments , both bilateral and multilateral , entered into by numerous countries at the subregional , regional or hemispheric level .  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
His Government had provided a total of over US $ 2-billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral technical , scientific and economic cooperation to other developing countries and planned to extend its cooperation to include not only Asia and Africa , but also the South Pacific , the Caribbean and Central America and to promote the concept of multiple beneficiaries .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
To support and ensure effective follow-up to bilateral and multilateral initiatives , including regional and subregional consultation processes , where appropriate , to develop national policies and cooperative strategies to maximize the benefits and manage the challenges posed by international migration ;  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
He urged the international community to establish a rule-based , equitable and transparent multilateral trading system and said that he hoped that the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations would promote development , eliminate trade barriers against developing countries and increase preferential treatment to promote the financing of development through trade .  
There needed to be better coordination of the functions of existing multilateral organizations , bringing together the key international institutions and national authorities involved in preserving the stability of the financial sector and cooperating on policies to reduce systemic risk .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
Renews the commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Renews its commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Guatemala supported the establishment of a special task force to define that partnership , and believed that it should be composed of a dozen or so representatives of the Secretariat and the administration of the World Bank and IMF and their respective intergovernmental agencies and should focus on studying the limits within which the multilateral financial institutions could participate in activities , on the understanding that the final decision lay with Member States . 
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
The plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful nations to accept rational and realistic changes in the Security Council is a key indicator of the future of global multilateral relations in general and of this Organization in particular .  
We understand that it demands coordinated and concerted efforts on the multilateral level and requires a thorough study of the political , military and economic aspects , in particular States legitimate defence and security needs .  
Its members , who were all highly qualified and experienced in their specializations , understood the concerns of developing countries and appreciated what bilateral and multilateral donors required in project design , preparation and implementation .  
The overriding preoccupation in this regard is to ensure that emerging multilateral systems enable different national models of political , economic and social organization to function within a universally accepted framework of norms and rules .  
To that end , the currently unworkable international financial system should be converted into a rational and sound system , and the multilateral trading system should be reformed in order to make it equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory and predictable .  
While the Cologne debt initiative was a welcome step towards that goal , it must be accompanied by realistic , genuine debt relief measures such as the conversion into grants of any remaining official bilateral and multilateral debt .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
The social situation was further worsened by the reduction in public expenditures required to meet budget deficit parameters agreed with multilateral financial institutions .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
Effective and meaningful collaborative efforts are required , involving Governments , multilateral development institutions , bilateral donors , the private sector , civil society and other relevant stakeholders , to enhance the developmental impact of ICT .  
In this regard , it recommended that creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions be encouraged to consider continuing the initiative and efforts to address commercial debt of heavily indebted African countries .  
The meeting , attended by representatives of global and regional multilateral environmental conventions , identified potential areas for collaboration among those conventions on topics such as assessment , trade and streamlining of national reporting .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
One of the main problems faced by local firms in the domestic market is securing effective and substantive participation in projects funded by multilateral funding agencies since they have found it difficult to meet the prequalification requirements .  
No less than some thirty conventions , multilateral agreements , uniform model laws or standard rules relating to international commercial dealings or international carriage are involved .  
Of critical importance is a fair , equitable and rulesbased multilateral trading system , operating in a nondiscriminatory , inclusive and transparent manner that provides benefits for all countries , especially developing countries .  
Exploring innovative sources for financing for development : considering innovative global instruments , including tax cooperation and global public goods financing mechanisms ; enhancing the contribution of multilateral development institutions , in particular the World Bank and regional development banks , in financial innovation in support of development ; promoting national and international public / private partnerships .  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
The international community is therefore invited to help my country to emerge from the crisis in which it finds itself by , among other things , participating in initiatives aimed at restoring lasting peace and resuming partnerships and bilateral and multilateral cooperation in accordance with our national development plans that will be formulated for the economic and social well-being of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
The definition and methodology lacked clarity , and the concept seemed more appropriate for a multinational corporation for which profit was paramount than for a multilateral international organization pursuing sensitive and complex political and socio-economic objectives agreed upon by consensus .  
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .  
For that reason his delegation had sponsored resolutions on the protection and security of small States in 1989 , 1991 and 1994 and remained convinced that a long-term solution to the problem required , among other things , the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to assist small States in protecting their security , sovereignty and territorial integrity in time of need .  Such assistance should be regarded as a political and moral obligation on the part of the international community .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
The recognition of special and differential treatments in favour of developing countries and an open , rule-based , transparent , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system are essential factors for a healthy global economic system .  
We stress that the major creditor countries should loosen their grip on the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture ; they should accept that representation in existing multilateral financial institutions should become broader and more balanced and that meaningful participation by developing countries in the decision-making processes , as well as greater transparency in such processes , should be ensured .  
Many delegations noted the necessity of an adequate replenishment of the multilateral fund of the Montreal Protocol , and emphasized that the implementation of the Protocol and its amendments would be strengthened through provision of additional financial resources to the fund , along with sound and affordable alternatives to ozone-depleting substances .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Emphasizing that at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , States undertook to promote multilateral , regional , subregional , and bilateral cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities to deal with criminal organizations involved in drug-related offences ,  
Recognizes , while bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , the importance of evaluating the impact of international financial , economic , monetary and multilateral trading systems on the enjoyment of human rights , while noting that issues such as those listed below are obstacles to the full realization of the right to development :  
The Programme was extended by the General Assembly in its resolution 2095 ( XX ) of 20 December 1965 , on a continuing basis for as long as multilateral food aid is found feasible and desirable , on the understanding that the Programme will be regularly reviewed before each pledging conference and that , if circumstances so require , it may be enlarged , curtailed or terminated at the end of any period for which resources have been pledged .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
IRU actively promotes the adoption and practical implementation of United Nations multilateral legal instruments on road transport in central and eastern Europe , in particular in newly independent States , as well as in Asia ; support and guidance to various EU aid projects on road transport .  It contributed to the elaboration of a draft revision of the European agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport and to discussion on a draft revision of the consolidated resolution on the facilitation of road transport ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Calls upon all States to take all appropriate national , bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent all forms of violence against children and to protect them from torture and other forms of violence , physical violence including domestic violence , child abuse , mental and sexual violence , abuse by the police and other law enforcement authorities or by employees in juvenile detention centres , orphanages , child care institutions and others , as well as violence in the street and in schools ;  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Executive Heads further recognized that , in order to contribute to progress in achieving the development and poverty eradication goals of the Millennium Summit , the system should strive , at the same time , not only to strengthen country level support but also to enhance policy coherence towards the creation of a more supportive international environment .  This implies contributing to reinforcing the role of the multilateral system in the management of globalization an objective that had found strong reaffirmation at the Summit and also strengthening policy coherence within the system itself .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
Urges developed country Parties to provide technical and financial assistance , as appropriate , through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative programmes to support the efforts of the Parties in implementing the programmes and measures identified in the annexed framework and to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention ;  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
In his view , the outcomes from the four expert meetings dealt with items which were both central elements of UNCTADs mandate as set out in the Bangkok Plan of Action , as well as constituting key issues on the international trade agenda and subject to intensive multilateral negotiation or review in the WTO .  
He said that the Meeting had been held against the background of the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture with two major objectives : ( i ) to clearly delineate those challenges and concerns that LDCs and NFIDCs faced during the Uruguay Round reform process in agriculture , and ( ii ) to examine how those concerns could be best addressed in the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations on agriculture .  
In the long term , the agricultural production base of developing countries should be improved , and in the short term , bilateral and multilateral food aid schemes should be strengthened .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
Although experts had expressed diverse views in the report , which demonstrated the difficulty in finding common solutions , the report and the Meeting had clearly indicated that UNCTADs analytical work in this area should continue and contribute to future multilateral trade negotiations , as well as to the definition of the national trade policy of individual countries .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
The recommendations called upon Governments to sign and ratify relevant international instruments on migrant workers ; develop bilateral and multilateral agreements with a view to raising awareness and ensuring the protection of the human rights of women migrant workers ; and to provide training to immigration , police and consular officers on the proper handling of cases of violence against women migrant workers .  
In our view , the Conference on Disarmament is a precious resource because , even in its current situation , it offers more space than any other forum for official multilateral dialogue on issues of concern .  Yet , questions are raised - for example , is the Conference on Disarmament a creature of the international security environment that awakes from its enforced hibernation only when there is adequate change in that environment ?  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
Belarus is convinced that a gradual movement from simple to more complex bilateral and multilateral measures and agreements will create a solid basis for preventing armed conflict and strengthening national and regional security , which in turn are integral elements of the modern architecture of a comprehensive and indivisible system of international security .  
But central to its success has been an organic sense of common purpose around which most operational and organizational questions revolve , and are resolved , with a minimum of fuss , by multilateral standards .  
In the view of my Government , it is especially necessary to undertake effective and substantial multilateral efforts , to consolidate existing instruments against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to set up universally verifiable and transparent arms control and disarmament regimes . 
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
He noted the Secretary-Generals recommendation that Governments should be urged to take steps to prepare a transparent , stable and predictable framework for investment and for building institutional infrastructures and that multilateral and bilateral donors should be encouraged to adopt suitable measures to permit faster and more extensive debt relief for poor countries .  
In that connection he stressed the need for an open , equitable , predictable , non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading system and expressed the hope that the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would achieve a new consensus model that took into account the needs and priorities of the developing world . 
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The complexity of managing East Timors public finances is compounded by the need to obtain donor support for the two primary trust funds ( the first funds the national budget , and the second supports capital investment and recovery ) , while coordinating other bilateral and multilateral development assistance .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
Reiterates its call upon all relevant funding institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as regional funding institutions and non-governmental organizations , to support , as appropriate , the efforts being made for the development of the renewable energy sector in developing countries on the basis of environment-friendly renewable sources of energy of demonstrated viability , while taking fully into account the development structure of energy-based economies of developing countries , and to assist in the attainment of the levels of investment necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
For that purpose , alliances have to be promoted between domestic and foreign enterprises of all sizes for the supply of services nationally and internationally ; a network of national and international companies supplying core and related energy services should be established ; and the energy strategy must be supported by Venezuelas active participation in the multilateral trade negotiation forums .  
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
Recalling the Millennium Declaration , which recognizes the special needs and problems of landlocked developing countries and urges both bilateral and multilateral donors to increase financial and technical assistance to this group of countries to meet their special development needs and to help them overcome the impediments of geography by improving their transit transport systems ,  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to continue to work closely with the World Trade Organization and other relevant multilateral institutions in the provision of technical assistance to African countries , in particular the least developed among them , so as to enhance their capacity to overcome technical barriers to trade in industrial and other products , including improving quality standards to alleviate supply-side constraints , and to promote industrial competitiveness within the context of the integrated framework initiative in order to enable them to integrate fully into the world economy ;  
Reiterates its call upon all relevant funding institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as regional funding institutions and non-governmental organizations , to support , as appropriate , the efforts being made for the development of the renewable energy sector in developing countries on the basis of environment-friendly renewable sources of energy of demonstrated viability , while taking fully into account the development structure of energy-based economies of developing countries , and to assist in the attainment of the levels of investment necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

With regard to trade and environment , the World Trade Organization has agreed to negotiations on the relationship between existing World Trade Organization rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , 13 procedures for regular information exchange between MEA secretariats and the relevant World Trade Organization committees , and the reduction or , as appropriate , elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services .  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
An increase in the resources of the Global Environment Facility to match the level of official assistance to developing countries , in view of the Facilitys important role as a basic financing tool for environmental and development activities ; the allocation of more resources to assistance in the implementation of programmes under the relevant multilateral conventions ; the granting of fair and equal opportunities to all developing countries to take advantage of the Facility ; and the simplification of procedures for obtaining from it financing for sustainable development projects ;  
The improvement of the access to international markets of products from countries affected by the phenomena of slavery , servitude and colonization , including the development and implementation of special and differential treatment in respect of the length of the adjustment periods in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that would establish a more equitable and supportive international trade environment for States that are populated substantially by people of African descent and indigenous peoples ;
