But despite this problem , and the rheumatism and neurasthenia that afflicted him , he continued to work until he had won the support and understanding of the public , and even his health improved .  
This sums up events in the past century when millions of Chinese suffered under the experiments of various political systems , including constitutional monarchy , socialism and Communism . During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
The Epidemic Disease Control panel supported continued cooperation with foreign organizations to develop a vaccine for hepatitis B . The overseas scholars set up a continuation committee to carry on this and related work .

The old woman gave P'ei Hang the powder and he pounded it in the mortar . When night fell she took it back inside , where the sound of pestling continued . Curious , P'ei Hang peeked through a crack in the door . Inside he saw a jade rabbit working the mortar in a room filled with brilliant light .  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
Since September 1984 , when the joint declaration was announced , the ships have continued to ply the harbor as busily as before ; the young people and Westerners continue to crowd the shopping district , with its windows full of tempting goods from around the world ; and the sound of mahjong continues to rise and fall from the upstairs tearooms . . . on the surface , nothing seems to have changed .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
In Europe , which has a strong cultural background of its own , sinological research - - setting out from the tasks of translation and textual criticism - - was exceptionally solid and meticulous , and major figures continued to appear up until the middle of this century .

CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
In the 1960s the government struggled to obtain foreign exchange . Under a policy of forcefully pursuing industrial development , record numbers of trees were cut . In 1960 the Yuli Forest District Office was established , and the forest compartments upstream continued to send down such top-grade conifers as red spruce and cypress and such broad-leaved trees as the Nanmu and Formosan Michelia .  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside . ( edited by Teng Sue-feng / photos by Vincent Chang )  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect .

But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
An adorable little female kite is called " Chachi " ( " Insert Wing " ) because one of the feathers on her wing appeared to be stuck in sideways . Her mate is called Mr . Hao ( " Mr .

Lang , Hao continued to fulfill his husbandly duties without complaint .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity .

Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
Among those elected , the five in the category of math and physical sciences are all engineering specialists , suggesting that applied science is being given increasing importance within the Academia Sinica . There was more diversity in the biology / chemistry group , with electees including specialists in medicine , neurology and molecular biology .

She continued to explain that the six holes in the shoes that monks and nuns wear represent planting one 's feet on solid ground , and seeing through the vanity of human desires . Their clothing varies according to region . For convenience , some wear long frocks ; others wear robes that leave the right shoulder bare , demonstrating sincerity . There are also special rules for getting dressed : Keep your whole body erect and look straight ahead ; only your hands can move .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture . His humor and criticism ought to have pushed modern Chinese to engage in self-reflection and seek progress .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
Taiwan in those days was wilderness , but the wide-open land and bountiful resources continued to attract Han Chinese from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong . According to historical sources , the population of coastal Fujian and Guangdong in that era was highly concentrated , with mountainous areas outweighing habitable ones , which further intensified the attraction of Taiwan for the Han .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .

Indeed the PRC has continued to move forward actively in relations with the US .

Ban Zhao herself was a thoroughly upper-class woman . Her father and older brother were both famous historians . Although she lost her husband at an early age and thus experienced little of marital bliss , she no doubt found considerable fulfillment in her very active life as a writer .

A temporary outdoor stage has been set up immediately opposite an Earth God temple . The purpose of hiring a drama troupe is to thank the gods for their benevolence and supplicate them for their continued good graces , but the audience is sparse , and the performers look rather uninspired . Tea-picking opera is only performed these days at an occasional temple function . Apart from the language , probably most people in Taiwan ca n't tell the difference between tea-picking opera and the ubiquitous Taiwanese opera .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .

The Danaiku Ecological Park was established in 1995 , and in 1996 its revenues totaled only NT $ 839,000 . The following year they more than doubled to nearly NT $ 2 million . This rapid growth continued in the years that followed , and the figure topped NT $ 10 million in 2001 . Currently there are nearly 80 village residents employed there as guides , plant tenders or sellers of souvenirs , traditional Tsou food or barbecued meat .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .

The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature .

While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .

He was gratified that the members of the Fifth Committee shared its concern about the sizeable volume of documentation and the growing number of meetings , which called for practical and flexible action to ensure both rationalization and continued high quality of services .  
Although the Croatian authorities are trying to assure the remaining Serbs that they are welcome to stay in Croatia , the Special Rapporteur has received numerous reports suggesting that in fact their continued residence in Croatia is not welcome .

that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
addition to the positive elements , however , recent information received from both inside and outside Iraq gave rise to serious concern that , after the adoption of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , Iraq had continued to acquire components from abroad for its missile programmes and had conducted a clandestine programme on missiles capable of reaching beyond the 150-kilometre range , the limit laid down in Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .

In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
In this regard , I am pleased to note that my country enjoys excellent , long-standing diplomatic relations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement , whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an expression of steadfastness in our convictions and in continued political cooperation . 
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
I should also like to express my special appreciation for the enlightened and committed leadership of your predecessor , Mr . Freitas do Amaral , who , in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly , made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations .  
We draw the attention of the international community to the precarious situation in the region , the consequences of continued failure and the increasing possibilities of confrontation , which make it necessary for the international community to be vigilant , dynamic and strict in implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save the region from the potential scourge of war .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
It will also provide for projects to ensure its active and continued role in the world trade system , which is undergoing explosive growth here at the end of the century , and for ambitious projects to open to trade and international investment the entire zone adjacent to the Canal , covering almost 150,000 hectares , which will thereby become an engine for the economic transformation of Panama . 
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
FAO concluded that such surveys , if continued over time , would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis .  
The Republic of Croatia , being cognizant that the overall peace process in the former Yugoslavia is at a delicate stage and being fully determined to contribute to peace and stability in the region , would support a continued deployment of United Nations military observers in the area of the Prevlaka peninsula in Croatia , with an understanding that such deployment shall be a short-term interim arrangement , until , as proposed by my Government , the United Nations arrangement is replaced by a regional arrangement .  
The facts revealed since this aircraft began to be used , as set out in our aforementioned letters , in addition to the ill repute the aircraft has acquired following earlier spy flights over other parts of the world , require that the United Nations re-examine the issue of continued forcible use of the aircraft by the United States of America to violate Iraq 's airspace in a manner totally incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as they relate to respect for the sovereignty of all Member States .  
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
PAIK ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan ) said that Afghanistan was in a desperate situation on account of the continued armed conflict with its attendant massacres , disappearances and violations of human rights , and that the land mines which were still widely scattered throughout the country , despite the heroic operations of the demining programmes conducted by United Nations agencies and numerous non-governmental organizations still posed a danger .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network ( comprising telecommunications and television , the Mir manned orbital station , space research and technological development , navigational safety , tracking of vessels in distress , topographic geodesy and cartography , and remote sensing of the Earth ) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability , further developing science and technology , improving the country 's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities .  
A solar research programme is being continued under the international Coronas-I project ( research on dynamic , active solar processes , the properties of solar cosmic radiation and electromagnetic radiation in the radio , visible , ultraviolet , X-ray and gamma bands ) .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Recalling that the Committee had requested a summary of the report presented by Ukraine at the Fourth World Conference on Women and had asked for further details of the commitments which Ukraine had made in Beijing , she said that the Ukrainian report to the Conference had described the overall deterioration of the situation of women , the decline in the standard of living , and the worsening demographic situation resulting from economic problems and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster , which continued to consume significant budgetary resources .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
Among the positive developments during the past month are a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations ; a further reduction in hostile propaganda ; the release of additional prisoners registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ( while the Government has freed all 353 such prisoners held by it , UNITA has so far released 139 ) ; the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions ; and continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 out of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
In his latest report , the Secretary-General informed the Security Council , inter alia , that , subsequent to the visits by a number of foreign dignitaries and the adoption of Council resolution 1045 ( 1996 ) , there had been positive developments during February 1996 , including a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations , a further reduction in hostile propaganda , the release of additional prisoners , the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions and the continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
Fundamental to this expanded inflow has been the increased confidence generated within the private sector , including the banking and insurance sectors , as a result of the willingness of country administrations to demonstrate a continued responsiveness to private investor concerns in the area of policy development , in the development and enhancement of stable and transparent mining and investment codes , and in the development of supportive administrative frameworks .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Strategic alliances , however , have several qualities that set them apart from other linkages : they are long-term , they involve " tight operating linkages " , they are based on some kind of formal or tacit agreement and they are underpinned by mutual expectations of continued cooperation .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
Following with increased concern and apprehension the continued Israeli occupation of the Syrian Arab Golan , Israel 's persistent refusal to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and to submit to the will of the international community , which considers the Israeli occupation and Israel 's decision to annex the Syrian Arab Golan as null and void and lacking any legal validity ,  
Condemning Israel 's continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa in flagrant violation of international law and in continuing disregard of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and relevant subsequent resolutions ,  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa ; and to call upon the international community , and upon the United Nations and all its associated bodies in particular , to strive for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and the relevant subsequent resolutions calling for Israel 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries ;  
To our disappointment , however , not only have military actions continued , but they have in fact intensified , as evident in the brutal shelling of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) compound earlier today , which has taken the lives of yet more innocent civilians .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .

Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .

Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .

One delegation expressed the view that as globalization and interdependence in the world economy continued to grow , an historic opportunity had arisen for constructive dialogue for the promotion of international cooperation for development , based on the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .

The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .  Such harmonization should , however , be treated as a longer-term objective .

In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
Nevertheless , there were some problems of a more fundamental nature , such as the facts that full and prompt delivery of revenues was not possible because of late payments by many Member States , that a number of Member States were deliberately violating the obligations entered into under the Charter with regard to the operation of the methodology and that severe imbalances in the distribution of revenue-sourcing were inevitable while so many developing countries continued to be impoverished by the existing economic system .  
The question arises , with growing urgency , as to whether any juridical legitimacy that could , arguably , have been derived from past acquiescence in the assumption of power by the Military Forces can any longer provide a defensible basis for the continued maintenance of a non-constitutional system based on the assumption of martial powers , having such an unfavourable impact on human rights in the context of generally accepted international norms and the obligations undertaken by Myanmar .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary General of NLD in her compound .

Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .

The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .

Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 January and 30 June 1997 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
Honduras pressed ahead with the cleansing of its political system , and Panama continued the process of broadening national consensus around the goal of a successful management of the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
In its resolution 51 / 30 G of 13 December 1996 , on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia , the General Assembly noted with concern that political instability and the absence of central authority continued to characterize Somalia and that , while the environment had become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , in others the humanitarian and security situation had worsened .  
After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of the difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy continued to exert a negative impact on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
In the light of the continued high prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition , UNICEF and WFP plan to enhance the protein content of monthly rations through the inclusion of UNIMIX and high protein biscuits , thus increasing supplementary feeding rations to 77 per cent of the daily needs of the beneficiary .  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields , and expresses the hope that he will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two organizations ;  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
The growth in chronic-disease mortality alongside the continued burden from communicable diseases has meant that many developing-country Governments are now faced with increasing pressure to shift scarce health resources away from the prevention and treatment of childhood infectious diseases to the treatment of chronic and degenerative diseases of adulthood .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
These are aggravated by , inter alia : stifling external indebtedness ; a continued deterioration of the terms of trade ; an alarming decline in official development assistance ; and an equally worrying reduction of international cooperation for development in general .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
Since recovering its territory and water under the peace treaty signed with Israel in October 1994 , Jordan has maintained its pivotal role in the process and continued its efforts with the other parties to achieve the desired goals of establishing a just , comprehensive and lasting peace which will be accepted , preserved and protected by future generations .  
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
In that statement baseless and unsubstantiated allegations were made against some regional States , including my country , to divert the attention of the international community from the illegal policies and inhuman actions of Israel , such as the continued occupation of the territories of others , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 July and 31 December 1996 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical , managerial , monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
While it could have opted for forced repatriation , Pakistan had continued to provide for the needs of Afghan refugees with its own resources , despite the enormous administrative , economic and social repercussions their presence in the country and their participation in the economic activities had caused , and the sometimes permanent environmental damage resulting from their concentration in the northern regions of the country . 
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Panama continued that the foregoing provisions would not apply where the domestic legislation of the State did not provide for due process of law with regard to the protection of the right or rights which had allegedly been violated ; the alleged victim of a violation had not been allowed access to domestic remedies , or had been impeded in exhausting such remedies ; there had been unreasonable delay in a decision with regard to domestic remedies .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , the International Civilian Mission in Haiti and United Nations Development Programme technical assistance in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian national police force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalization of the Haitian national police and towards fulfilment of the May 1997 " Haitian national police development plan for 1997-2001 " ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
The invited experts , who had included members of the Palestinian Council , the Israeli Knesset and the European Parliament and leading academics from different regions , had made presentations in three plenary sessions , which had been followed by lively and frank discussions that had reflected the great concern of all participants that the accords concluded by the parties should be implemented and the peace process continued .  
It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
Mr . Boris Yeltsin and Mr . Leonid D . Kuchma expressed their support for the continued growth of mutual trade , the harmonization of economic relations , the creation of the necessary conditions for establishing mutually advantageous cooperation between economic agents , the settlement of existing disputes in the area of mutual trade , and the speedy removal of artificial trade barriers .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
In contrast to the positions adopted by some human rights bodies which considered that once the reservation was deemed impermissible the reserving State continued to be bound by the treaty as a whole , he emphasized that the treaty was still a consensual instrument , drawing its strength from the will of States . 37 / The reservations made , he said , were consubstantial with the State 's consent to be bound by the treaty . 
It was even more dangerous when information imbalances were accompanied by aggressive policies which violated independence and national sovereignty ; Cuba continued to be the target of radio and television attacks by the Government of the United States of America in open defiance of the elementary norms of coexistence among States and the principles of international law , and despite repeated condemnation by specialized bodies and forums .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
A number of experts expressed concern at the slow and cumbersome procedures which continued to cause considerable delays in moving transit cargo out of the port and across national boundaries .  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
Despite the political and economic development achieved at the regional and international levels , the establishment of economic groupings and the expansion of free trade , there had been an increase in poverty , diseases and illiteracy resulting in a deterioration in the standards of living of developing countries .  Moreover , economic barriers continued to be erected against developing countries .  
Despite its political will to carry out the necessary reforms , the Cambodian Government continued to face two major obstacles : the enormous bilateral and multilateral debt , which constituted a heavy burden on the Government , and poorer access to markets and deteriorating terms of trade .  
In view of the continued conflict and human tragedy in Afghanistan and the stalemated efforts to involve all the parties concerned in constructive and viable political dialogue , on 29 July , I appointed Mr . Lakhdar Brahimi as my Special Envoy on a short mission to consult interested and relevant countries and parties , as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference , and to present a comprehensive review of the United Nations peacemaking activities in Afghanistan . 
The Agency had agreed in March 1996 to permit the survey of UNRWA vehicles as a pragmatic , temporary and exceptional measure only .  Moreover , despite the establishment of a special VIP / international organizations lane at the Erez checkpoint and UNRWA 's agreement to a magnetic card system which was proposed to expedite crossings , the search procedures continued to result in time-consuming delays for UNRWA staff and , on occasion , damage to UNRWA vehicles .  
Other findings included continued recruitment from a narrow geographical base with apparently no attempt to diversify recruitment sources as prescribed by existing policies , finalization of special service agreements during or even after the consultancy in many cases and high consultancy fees .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
Chouinard ( Canada ) said that , with the year 2000 fast approaching , sustainable development continued to be the most vital issue facing mankind ; it required a concerted and long-term commitment from the international community . 
However , the separatist authorities which were in control of the eastern part of the country continued to violate the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights of the Moldovan people .  
While voluntary contributions continued to be sought for the RDMHQ , the contributions received so far fell far short of the total of nearly $ 3.2-million that had been identified as necessary for the first two years of the RDMHQ .  
The difficulty in providing adequate health care , the continued practice of open drainage , the indiscriminate disposal of waste water and industrial effluents and rampant water pollution have resulted in the creation of mega-slums unsuitable for human living .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Regrettably , he was bound to report that the situation of human rights in Iraq had not improved during the previous year , and that the Iraqi Government continued to commit massive and systematic violations of the basic rights of the population .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The transformation from emergency reconstruction to sustainable longer-term development also assumes continued political and economic stability , which provides a necessary , but not sufficient , basis for rapid growth , a key national objective .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .

The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,

He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , we stress that there are measurable , anthropogenic impacts on the global climate , that these impacts are on the rise , and that continued unchecked growth in greenhouse gas concentrations will result in dire ecological , social , and economic consequences .  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
It has continued to implement the good offices mandate vested in my Special Representative by conducting an active dialogue with the authorities and all other major political forces in the country ; encouraging cross-party dialogue and a better understanding among the various segments of the population with a view to easing inter-ethnic tensions ; and promoting the application of international standards of human rights .  
Over the past year , the Secretariat has continued to work to ensure a coherent , well planned , coordinated and comprehensive approach to conflict situations , which makes use of political , social and developmental instruments .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
The IFF process is testimony to the international communitys continued commitment to the holistic and cross-sectoral approach to addressing some of the more pressing problems faced by many countries worldwide , such as how to achieve development without degrading the environment and the basic life support systems to such an extent that it causes irreversible changes .  
The law provided a framework for improving their status , but it was unevenly implemented because of ingrained cultural attitudes ; large segments of rural and urban society still resorted to customary laws in regard to marriage and divorce and dangerous traditional practices , such as circumcision , continued to prevail in many areas .  
Some delegations expressed continued support for improving the operation of GESAMP , while noting at the same time that regional approaches were most practical for improving access to sound scientific understanding .  
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
In its resolution 1193 ( 1998 ) of 28 August 1998 , the Security Council identified a further relevant factor when it noted the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in Afghanistan , including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict , such interference continued unabated .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .  
That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .  
In addition , in paragraph 25 , the Assembly expressed concern over continued high rates of self-revision during peak workload periods and occasional inadequate translations , which had sometimes hampered the work of delegations , and emphasized the importance of continuous training for all translators at all duty stations and of developing measures to provide translators with increased support from submitting offices and secretariats .  
For example , in advanced economies , average proportional revenue collections have not fallen at all so far ; in fact , the average proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries collected as revenue continued to edge up during the 1990s . 
Among the various configurations of South / South cooperation , the evidence gathered for this report provides incontestable proof that the specific modality of technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) has not only remained in widespread use but has continued to grow in popularity and application among developing country partners .  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Armed conflict in southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .

Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
While officials elected in 1995 ( mayoral cartels and administrative councils of the communal sections ) were reappointed as interim agents of the executive or simply dismissed and replaced ( as in the case of the Mayor of Port-au-Prince ) , officials elected in 1997 as members of the territorial assemblies continued to enjoy their prerogatives .  
Also , many speakers , while supporting the use of advanced technologies , including the Internet , stressed that this should not be done at the expense of traditional means of communication , such as radio , which continued to be the main source of information in most developing countries .  
In that context , it continued to be concerned about the damaging effects of armed conflict on Afghan children , who were the victims of incessant hostilities and abhorrent treatment by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
While noting some signs of greater political freedom in East Timor , these sources reported that East Timorese continued to be persecuted , arbitrarily arrested or routinely harassed for the peaceful expression of their convictions or because they were suspected of supporting the armed resistance .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance to indigenous societies of their lands , territories and resources for their continued survival and vitality .  
The post-eruptive residual volcanic activity has included occasional collapse of the lava dome to generate pyroclastic flows , vigorous venting of ash and gas sometimes accompanied by small explosions and the generation of small but mobile pyroclastic flows , occasional swarms of volcano-tectonic earthquakes , and continued ground deformation on the eastern flanks of the volcano .  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
Also , many speakers , while supporting the use of advanced technologies , including the Internet , stressed that this should not be done at the expense of traditional means of communication , such as radio , which continued to be the main source of information in most developing countries .  
During the period under review and as part of its efforts to promote informed public understanding about the goals and activities of the United Nations worldwide , the Department of Public Information has continued to develop partnerships and strengthen the channels of communication with a broad range of information redisseminators , including the media , educational institutions , United Nations depository libraries , non-governmental organizations and other elements of civil society .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
During the period under review , the Government of Argentina maintained its position that the restoration of communications between the mainland and the Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) continued to be a primary objective , since improved links would produce commercial and economic benefits for the entire region , by creating the necessary framework for achieving a greater understanding between the inhabitants of the region and for serving their interests .  
Conditions of increasing social and economic vulnerability will almost certainly lead to unprecedented natural and related hazards in the future , so specific recommendations are made to ensure continued advocacy , the development of policies and the coordination of institutionalized abilities into the twenty-first century .  
We note that countries in the region participating in the Stability Pact commit themselves to continued democratic and economic reforms , as well as bilateral and regional cooperation among themselves to advance their integration , on an individual basis , into Euro-Atlantic structures .  
A strategy has been implemented on the basis of the principles of sustainable human development , the continued growth in acquiring new knowledge , culture , the spirit of invention and popular participation through the establishment of an organized , stable and strong society with transparent and efficient institutions .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .

The work of UNRWA continued to be affected by the continuing financial crisis that the Agency has faced since 1993 as a result of repeated shortfalls in funding for the regular budget combined with increasing refugee needs .  
The Economic and Social Monitoring Unit continued to publish periodic reports on economic and social conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory , in addition to a special report entitled The economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip : a retrospective on the 1990s and future challenges .  
Based on programme areas defined by the Scientific and Technical Committee and implemented through thematic and regional meetings , the plan of action was focused on concrete goals in the fields of ( a ) continued advocacy , ( b ) development of policies , and ( c ) coordination of institutional capacities .  
It was recognized that the increasing number of international cooperative programmes in outer space required the continued harmonization of international intellectual property standards and legislation ;  
Conserving the environment , the advent of the information age and continued exploration of the solar system are just some of the important global issues in relation to which space technology can play a leading role in the coming years and many multilateral mechanisms already exist to promote greater international cooperation , in particular with a view to assisting developing countries .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
While welcoming the many spectacular achievements in outer space and space-related activities , the President drew attention to the numerous social and economic challenges that continued to face humankind , particularly in developing countries .  
Some representatives pointed out that industry in industrialized countries continued to play an active role in developing both new and innovative space applications and technology geared for markets in services in satellite communications , remote sensing and space transportation .  
The background to this actuarial assumption was described in the report of the Board to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session . 3 At its meetings in 1997 and 1998 , the Committee of Actuaries considered the methodology for determining the level of administrative expenses to be assumed in the actuarial valuations , taking into account that the number of retirees continued to grow at a greater rate than that of active participants . 
The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
The Assembly expressed deep concern at the continued plight of unaccompanied minors , emphasizing the urgent need for early identification and for timely , detailed and accurate information on their number and whereabouts .  
However , the continued burden of this huge caseload , diminishing prospects for a speedy settlement of the conflict , dwindling international resources and the prevailing economic difficulties in both countries of asylum have badly affected the long-held asylum traditions .  
The cooperation between the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and OIC , through its subsidiary organs and its specialized and affiliated institutions , was closely continued in the social , humanitarian and technical fields and in their bilateral search for solutions to global problems in the region .  
Public security in the region is threatened by the continued escalation in the rate of common crime and social violence , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
We in Saint Lucia strongly support the continued participation of these Territories in regional institutions as a natural function of our ongoing Caribbean integration process , and as a critical component of the economic , social and constitutional development of the Caribbean .  
The continued and enhanced role of countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific is critical to the future development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories whose economic , political and social advancement can not be successfully addressed separately from the respective regions of which they are an integral part .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
Replies received from Member States indicated that traditional and customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , in particular female genital mutilation , continued to be the subject of national action .  
During this time of increased calls for international resources for Kosovo and other parts of the world , when donor fatigue for Bosnia and Herzegovina is very real , the continued unwillingness of substantial parts of the local leadership to create conditions conducive to returns and to the integral implementation of the Dayton peace agreement can not be tolerated . 
Activities in the Paris Club in the second half of 1998 and the first half of 1999 were marked by continued restructuring of the debts of the poorest countries in the context of the HIPC initiative ; the return of middle-income countries to reschedule their official bilateral debts ; and special measures taken in support of countries affected by conflict or natural disaster .  
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .  
Stresses also the continued need for urgent and substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone , as well as for sustained and generous assistance for the longer term tasks of peace-building , reconstruction , economic and social recovery and development in Sierra Leone , and urges all States and international and other organizations to provide such assistance as a priority ;  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;

Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
Stresses also the continued need for urgent and substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone , as well as for sustained and generous assistance for the longer term tasks of peace-building , reconstruction , economic and social recovery and development in Sierra Leone , and urges all States and international and other organizations to provide such assistance as a priority ;  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
The successful completion of the democratic presidential election in Indonesia is encouraging in this context too : it is a testimony to the continued progress of democratization in Indonesia and is in itself reassuring for the future of East Timor , which needs to develop friendly and cooperative relations with neighbouring countries , Indonesia in particular .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
In that context , it was regrettable that Israel continued to apply inhumane practices against the Palestinian people of the occupied territories and to confiscate their land , water and other natural resources , in flagrant violation of the principle , based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law , that land and other resources could not legitimately be acquired by force .  
At the legislative level , womens civil status continued to be restricted ; despite the ratification of international instruments , the offending provisions in the laws had not been amended .

It was therefore truly regrettable that violations of such principles continued to occur , as in the imposition of the aerial exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq by two permanent members of the Security Council , the continuing military attacks on Iraq and the interference in its internal affairs .  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Takes note with appreciation of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur , 5 and encourages the continued efforts on the part of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief , appointed to examine incidents and governmental actions in all parts of the world that are incompatible with the provisions of the Declaration and to recommend remedial measures as appropriate ;  
Underscores that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow Up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and , therefore , stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
Furthermore , the international community must examine the continued viability of frameworks for the protection of intellectual property , ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights of owners and innovators to a secure and appropriate return on their investment and the larger social benefit that would result from wide , unrestricted knowledge flows .  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity in the peace and security , political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
In spite of its economic , geopolitical and developmental constraints , the Jordanian Government continued to review the human rights guarantees provided through its legal , judicial and administrative systems .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
There continued to be widespread manifestations of disguised and increasingly sophisticated forms of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia in the world , particularly in regions with a high level of economic development , a fact that had been recognized and denounced in various forums .

Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
Takes note with appreciation of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur , 8 and encourages the continued efforts on the part of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief , appointed to examine incidents and governmental actions in all parts of the world that are incompatible with the provisions of the Declaration and to recommend remedial measures as appropriate ;  
Supports the efforts by the High Representative and the multinational Stabilization Force in accordance with the Peace Agreement and subsequent Peace Implementation Council Declarations , to weaken the continued political and economic influence of remaining parallel nationalist structures obstructing the peace implementation ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued , so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example , in the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;

Supports the efforts by the High Representative and the multinational Stabilization Force in accordance with the Peace Agreement and subsequent Peace Implementation Council Declarations , to weaken the continued political and economic influence of remaining parallel nationalist structures obstructing the peace implementation ;  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .

From that time on , successive economic measures against the Cuban people continued to accumulate until they formed a absolute and total blockade , which went so far as to prevent Cuba from importing even an aspirin produced in the United States , or from exporting to that country a single flower grown in Cuba .  
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .

Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .

Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;

It is appropriate to recall today that , against the backdrop of an Israeli occupation that has continued for several decades , the Government of Ariel Sharon initiated a systematic policy of aggression against the Palestinian people , destroying their property , imposing economic blockades on their towns and villages and collective punishment through the repeated use of excessive and sustained force with all the weapons in the Israeli arsenal , and using force on a daily basis against unarmed Palestinian civilians .

There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
On the contrary , arbitrary detentions continued to occur throughout the year , by order of higher authority , which means that imprisonment is decided by the executive power , subject to no control whatsoever by the judicial authorities .  
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
In Australia , where , a few decades previously , the Government had abducted over 100,000 aboriginal children in order to place them with white families , discrimination against and segregation of indigenous people continued and their economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to own land , were restricted . 
The transition to a child rights approach can be hampered by : conservative economic and social policies characterized by paternalism and political patronage ; the insufficient capacity of local-level bodies to assume the new responsibilities ; the continued application of archaic law regarding minors ; resistance to child rights concepts by executive , legislative and / or judicial officials ; and the absence of valid , timely and relevant data and indicators on the fulfilment and violation of rights .  
I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Lebanese Government for the impartial attitude adopted by the United Nations in southern Lebanon following the recent Israeli threats in connection with this matter and to thank the Organization for UNIFILs continued fulfilment of its mandate and , in particular , for the humanitarian assistance and medical care it provides to the local inhabitants and for its active participation in the task of clearing the mines laid by Israel in the area .

Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Notes with concern the continued problems related to the rule of law and the functioning of the judiciary , inter alia , of corruption , including interference by the executive with the independence of the judiciary , welcomes the Governments continued commitment to reform the judiciary , commends its current efforts to prepare the laws and codes that are essential components of the basic legal framework , and urges the Government to continue to take the necessary measures to promote the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy and the judicial system as a whole ;  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Recognizing the need for deepening its collective analysis of the many interrelated dimensions of globalization and their implications for the work of the system , ACC continued its reflection during 2000 on the impact of globalization , focusing at its first regular session , on the interrelationships between trade and economic , social and environmental dimensions and on the issue of information technology ( see ACC / 2000 / 4 ) .  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
Using available estimates , a minimum of $ 500-700-million of global funding , on which countries can draw swiftly in order to fill their budgetary gaps , must be generated , and an additional $ 500-800-million will be required to ensure continued accessibility by countries to essential interventions such as safe and efficacious combination drugs ( once current first-line treatments have outlived their usefulness ) or long-lasting insecticide-treated nets .  
In addition to the continued unity of effort of its components , in close cooperation with KFOR , in the crucial period in the run-up to elections , the Mission will require the ongoing support of its activities by the international community , including material support , and , above all , the strong and committed support it has enjoyed from members of the Security Council and Member States since its inception .  
Until these fundamental issues are addressed , local police will not be able to substitute for a continued robust international security presence mandated , staffed and equipped to maintain overall security and provide specific protection to international personnel and property .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
In the field of human rights , the ILO has continued to collaborate with other international organizations on issues such as freedom of association , discrimination in employment and occupation , equal opportunities of men and women in employment , indigenous and tribal peoples , migrant workers , forced labour , child labour , and other questions falling within the mandate of ILO .

UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
It was also stated that continued discussion on highly theoretical issues related to the topic tended to diminish the relative and fragile clarity which had been achieved and , in this connection , the point was made that approaching the topic in more practical terms could be more conducive to making progress on it .  
The practice is nevertheless being continued ; for example , a competitive examination for English interpreters capable of working from Russian is planned for early 2002 for the candidates being trained in-house in the autumn as well as for other applicants ; an examination for English translators capable of translating from Arabic will be given in February 2002 , and a similar examination for French translators may also be held in 2002 if the competitive examination scheduled for September 2001 does not produce a significant number of successful candidates proficient in Arabic .  
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
The Government of Panama , whose foreign policy is fully engaged in the development of the democratic system and respect for human rights throughout the world , believes that the continued exclusion of the Republic of China from the United Nations system is inconsistent with the principles that underlie the Organizations functioning , the commitment to the democratic system and human rights that the United Nations system proclaims and promotes , and the international realities witnessed by all the peoples of the world .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
Third countries should remain wary of returning certain categories of refugees to Bosnia and Herzegovina , especially when those refugees are determined to be in continued need of international protection by UNHCR or are from such areas where ethnically motivated violations of economic and social rights persists and where there is no true climate of security .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
The continued careful targeting of the limited , uncommitted , voluntary funds will be critical to the recovery of the territorys economic and social sectors and poverty reduction .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
However , over a-billion people had continued to live in extreme poverty , with millions of people unemployed , and a growing number of societies breaking up along racial , ethnic or social fault lines .  
While , by their nature , countries and Governments could be held accountable for compliance with the relevant rules governing the protection of those engaged in humanitarian work , non-State actors continued to show complete disregard for them .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
In conclusion , let me reassure the Assembly of my Governments continued commitment to supporting and expanding the Agencys role in international cooperation in the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation for the benefit of all member States .

Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance , including both humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Climate change had , among other things , increased the scarcity and diminished the quality of fresh water and had contributed to the degradation of coastal zones and marine ecosystems in all CARICOM member countries , which therefore continued to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Provide a forum for continued policy development and dialogue among Governments , which would involve international organizations and other interested parties , including major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to foster a common understanding on sustainable forest management and to address forest issues and emerging areas of priority concern in a holistic , comprehensive and integrated manner ;

During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
The Epidemic Disease Control panel supported continued cooperation with foreign organizations to develop a vaccine for hepatitis B . The overseas scholars set up a continuation committee to carry on this and related work . The Food Technology panel : Increase cooperative planning between domestic growers , producers , and exporters , increase the quality of products ; reduce overhead ; produce new processed foods to open new markets .  
The old woman gave P'ei Hang the powder and he pounded it in the mortar . When night fell she took it back inside , where the sound of pestling continued . Curious , P'ei Hang peeked through a crack in the door . Inside he saw a jade rabbit working the mortar in a room filled with brilliant light .  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
Since September 1984 , when the joint declaration was announced , the ships have continued to ply the harbor as busily as before ; the young people and Westerners continue to crowd the shopping district , with its windows full of tempting goods from around the world ; and the sound of mahjong continues to rise and fall from the upstairs tearooms . . . on the surface , nothing seems to have changed .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
In Europe , which has a strong cultural background of its own , sinological research - - setting out from the tasks of translation and textual criticism - - was exceptionally solid and meticulous , and major figures continued to appear up until the middle of this century .  
And that 's not all - - the international society of Very Special Arts has decided to open a branch in Taipei , with funds and topnotch teachers to help develop the talented handicapped persons in the ROCAt the beginning of this year , attorney Lawrence H .

CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
In the 1960s the government struggled to obtain foreign exchange . Under a policy of forcefully pursuing industrial development , record numbers of trees were cut . In 1960 the Yuli Forest District Office was established , and the forest compartments upstream continued to send down such top-grade conifers as red spruce and cypress and such broad-leaved trees as the Nanmu and Formosan Michelia .  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside . ( edited by Teng Sue-feng / photos by Vincent Chang )  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
An adorable little female kite is called " Chachi " ( " Insert Wing " ) because one of the feathers on her wing appeared to be stuck in sideways . Her mate is called Mr . Hao ( " Mr .

Lang , Hao continued to fulfill his husbandly duties without complaint .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity . All unreasonable restrictions will be removed to allow the emergence of a system of life-long learning . Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
Among those elected , the five in the category of math and physical sciences are all engineering specialists , suggesting that applied science is being given increasing importance within the Academia Sinica . There was more diversity in the biology / chemistry group , with electees including specialists in medicine , neurology and molecular biology . The social science and humanities group , meanwhile , following an old tradition , continued to be dominated by economists .  
She continued to explain that the six holes in the shoes that monks and nuns wear represent planting one 's feet on solid ground , and seeing through the vanity of human desires . Their clothing varies according to region . For convenience , some wear long frocks ; others wear robes that leave the right shoulder bare , demonstrating sincerity . There are also special rules for getting dressed : Keep your whole body erect and look straight ahead ; only your hands can move .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture . His humor and criticism ought to have pushed modern Chinese to engage in self-reflection and seek progress .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
Taiwan in those days was wilderness , but the wide-open land and bountiful resources continued to attract Han Chinese from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong . According to historical sources , the population of coastal Fujian and Guangdong in that era was highly concentrated , with mountainous areas outweighing habitable ones , which further intensified the attraction of Taiwan for the Han .  
It continued : " Chinese emperors collected these works over 11 centuries . Some of the pieces predate them-the elaborate wine vessel from the mid-ninth century BC , for example , and the curious reddish bronze vat , or liang , from AD 9 that was intended to enforce a new set of volumetric standards . In complexity , both works are years ahead of their Western equivalents . Nor was there a Western equivalent of the enormous workshops that , in centuries to come , filled these emperors ' warehouses . "  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
Tomatoes ca n't stand high temperatures at night and they are vulnerable to bacterial wilt . AVRDC cultivation expert Chen Cheng-tsu , who has developed a number of excellent tomato strains , is untiring in his continued research on this highly nutritious fruit .

Indeed the PRC has continued to move forward actively in relations with the US .

Ban Zhao herself was a thoroughly upper-class woman . Her father and older brother were both famous historians . Although she lost her husband at an early age and thus experienced little of marital bliss , she no doubt found considerable fulfillment in her very active life as a writer . She finished the writing of Ba Biao and Tianwen Zhi , both of which had been started by her father and continued by her brother .  
A temporary outdoor stage has been set up immediately opposite an Earth God temple . The purpose of hiring a drama troupe is to thank the gods for their benevolence and supplicate them for their continued good graces , but the audience is sparse , and the performers look rather uninspired . Tea-picking opera is only performed these days at an occasional temple function . Apart from the language , probably most people in Taiwan ca n't tell the difference between tea-picking opera and the ubiquitous Taiwanese opera .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
Large-scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 .

The Danaiku Ecological Park was established in 1995 , and in 1996 its revenues totaled only NT $ 839,000 . The following year they more than doubled to nearly NT $ 2 million . This rapid growth continued in the years that followed , and the figure topped NT $ 10 million in 2001 . Currently there are nearly 80 village residents employed there as guides , plant tenders or sellers of souvenirs , traditional Tsou food or barbecued meat .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
Wu explains that the high-tech industry peaked in 1999 going into 2001 , but after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 , the global economy went into a deep recession . To make matters worse , the dot-com bubble burst in the United States , investors suffered loss after loss in the stock market , consumer spending fell , and prices continued to decline , resulting in what economists call a deflationary economy .  
" In the last few years , the government has come out with a number of preferential tax policies , with bizarre results , " says Steve Tsui . " Even in years when the rate of economic growth has been decent , tax revenues have continued to fall . " Under these circumstances , economic growth alone can not rescue government finances . The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
In 1993 , this celebrated artist sold his paintings at Sotheby 's for prices that stunned the art world , only to put down his paintbrush a few years later .

Following this success , Huang took up painting again and continued to create his unique kingdom of colors .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever .

However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .  
Social disintegration has increased , the vertical development of nuclear weapons has continued and civil wars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions in a manner that has given the impression that the globe we live on has suddenly exploded .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .

While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .

that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
addition to the positive elements , however , recent information received from both inside and outside Iraq gave rise to serious concern that , after the adoption of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , Iraq had continued to acquire components from abroad for its missile programmes and had conducted a clandestine programme on missiles capable of reaching beyond the 150-kilometre range , the limit laid down in Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .

In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
In this regard , I am pleased to note that my country enjoys excellent , long-standing diplomatic relations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement , whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an expression of steadfastness in our convictions and in continued political cooperation . 
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
I should also like to express my special appreciation for the enlightened and committed leadership of your predecessor , Mr . Freitas do Amaral , who , in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly , made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations .  
We draw the attention of the international community to the precarious situation in the region , the consequences of continued failure and the increasing possibilities of confrontation , which make it necessary for the international community to be vigilant , dynamic and strict in implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save the region from the potential scourge of war .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
It will also provide for projects to ensure its active and continued role in the world trade system , which is undergoing explosive growth here at the end of the century , and for ambitious projects to open to trade and international investment the entire zone adjacent to the Canal , covering almost 150,000 hectares , which will thereby become an engine for the economic transformation of Panama . 
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
FAO concluded that such surveys , if continued over time , would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis .  
The Republic of Croatia , being cognizant that the overall peace process in the former Yugoslavia is at a delicate stage and being fully determined to contribute to peace and stability in the region , would support a continued deployment of United Nations military observers in the area of the Prevlaka peninsula in Croatia , with an understanding that such deployment shall be a short-term interim arrangement , until , as proposed by my Government , the United Nations arrangement is replaced by a regional arrangement .  
The facts revealed since this aircraft began to be used , as set out in our aforementioned letters , in addition to the ill repute the aircraft has acquired following earlier spy flights over other parts of the world , require that the United Nations re-examine the issue of continued forcible use of the aircraft by the United States of America to violate Iraq 's airspace in a manner totally incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as they relate to respect for the sovereignty of all Member States .  
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
PAIK ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan ) said that Afghanistan was in a desperate situation on account of the continued armed conflict with its attendant massacres , disappearances and violations of human rights , and that the land mines which were still widely scattered throughout the country , despite the heroic operations of the demining programmes conducted by United Nations agencies and numerous non-governmental organizations still posed a danger .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network ( comprising telecommunications and television , the Mir manned orbital station , space research and technological development , navigational safety , tracking of vessels in distress , topographic geodesy and cartography , and remote sensing of the Earth ) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability , further developing science and technology , improving the country 's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities .  
A solar research programme is being continued under the international Coronas-I project ( research on dynamic , active solar processes , the properties of solar cosmic radiation and electromagnetic radiation in the radio , visible , ultraviolet , X-ray and gamma bands ) .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Recalling that the Committee had requested a summary of the report presented by Ukraine at the Fourth World Conference on Women and had asked for further details of the commitments which Ukraine had made in Beijing , she said that the Ukrainian report to the Conference had described the overall deterioration of the situation of women , the decline in the standard of living , and the worsening demographic situation resulting from economic problems and the impact of the Chernobyl disaster , which continued to consume significant budgetary resources .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
Among the positive developments during the past month are a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations ; a further reduction in hostile propaganda ; the release of additional prisoners registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ( while the Government has freed all 353 such prisoners held by it , UNITA has so far released 139 ) ; the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions ; and continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 out of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
In his latest report , the Secretary-General informed the Security Council , inter alia , that , subsequent to the visits by a number of foreign dignitaries and the adoption of Council resolution 1045 ( 1996 ) , there had been positive developments during February 1996 , including a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations , a further reduction in hostile propaganda , the release of additional prisoners , the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions and the continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
Fundamental to this expanded inflow has been the increased confidence generated within the private sector , including the banking and insurance sectors , as a result of the willingness of country administrations to demonstrate a continued responsiveness to private investor concerns in the area of policy development , in the development and enhancement of stable and transparent mining and investment codes , and in the development of supportive administrative frameworks .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Strategic alliances , however , have several qualities that set them apart from other linkages : they are long-term , they involve " tight operating linkages " , they are based on some kind of formal or tacit agreement and they are underpinned by mutual expectations of continued cooperation .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
Following with increased concern and apprehension the continued Israeli occupation of the Syrian Arab Golan , Israel 's persistent refusal to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and to submit to the will of the international community , which considers the Israeli occupation and Israel 's decision to annex the Syrian Arab Golan as null and void and lacking any legal validity ,  
Condemning Israel 's continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa in flagrant violation of international law and in continuing disregard of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and relevant subsequent resolutions ,  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa ; and to call upon the international community , and upon the United Nations and all its associated bodies in particular , to strive for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and the relevant subsequent resolutions calling for Israel 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries ;  
To our disappointment , however , not only have military actions continued , but they have in fact intensified , as evident in the brutal shelling of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) compound earlier today , which has taken the lives of yet more innocent civilians .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
The continued expansion of the aggregate output was accompanied by encouraging development in fiscal performance , with the central government budget operations producing a surplus of EC $ 3.7-million in 1994 as compared with EC $ 2.2-million recorded in 1993 . 
Economic reform and structural adjustment programmes designed to correct internal and external imbalances as well as to enhance efficiency and productivity , which are particularly essential in a rapidly globalizing world economy , continued to be implemented in most countries in the ESCWA region in 1995 . 
Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .

Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .

Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .

" Noting with regret the continued decline in official development assistance devoted to the implementation and follow-up of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
One delegation expressed the view that as globalization and interdependence in the world economy continued to grow , an historic opportunity had arisen for constructive dialogue for the promotion of international cooperation for development , based on the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .  
The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .  Such harmonization should , however , be treated as a longer-term objective .

In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
Nevertheless , there were some problems of a more fundamental nature , such as the facts that full and prompt delivery of revenues was not possible because of late payments by many Member States , that a number of Member States were deliberately violating the obligations entered into under the Charter with regard to the operation of the methodology and that severe imbalances in the distribution of revenue-sourcing were inevitable while so many developing countries continued to be impoverished by the existing economic system .  
The question arises , with growing urgency , as to whether any juridical legitimacy that could , arguably , have been derived from past acquiescence in the assumption of power by the Military Forces can any longer provide a defensible basis for the continued maintenance of a non-constitutional system based on the assumption of martial powers , having such an unfavourable impact on human rights in the context of generally accepted international norms and the obligations undertaken by Myanmar .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary General of NLD in her compound .

Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .

The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .

The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 January and 30 June 1997 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
Honduras pressed ahead with the cleansing of its political system , and Panama continued the process of broadening national consensus around the goal of a successful management of the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone was entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any kind such as race , colour or national origin , yet violations continued daily .  
The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
In its resolution 51 / 30 G of 13 December 1996 , on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia , the General Assembly noted with concern that political instability and the absence of central authority continued to characterize Somalia and that , while the environment had become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , in others the humanitarian and security situation had worsened .  
After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of the difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy continued to exert a negative impact on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
In the light of the continued high prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition , UNICEF and WFP plan to enhance the protein content of monthly rations through the inclusion of UNIMIX and high protein biscuits , thus increasing supplementary feeding rations to 77 per cent of the daily needs of the beneficiary .  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields , and expresses the hope that he will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two organizations ;  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
The growth in chronic-disease mortality alongside the continued burden from communicable diseases has meant that many developing-country Governments are now faced with increasing pressure to shift scarce health resources away from the prevention and treatment of childhood infectious diseases to the treatment of chronic and degenerative diseases of adulthood .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
These are aggravated by , inter alia : stifling external indebtedness ; a continued deterioration of the terms of trade ; an alarming decline in official development assistance ; and an equally worrying reduction of international cooperation for development in general .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
Since recovering its territory and water under the peace treaty signed with Israel in October 1994 , Jordan has maintained its pivotal role in the process and continued its efforts with the other parties to achieve the desired goals of establishing a just , comprehensive and lasting peace which will be accepted , preserved and protected by future generations .  
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
In that statement baseless and unsubstantiated allegations were made against some regional States , including my country , to divert the attention of the international community from the illegal policies and inhuman actions of Israel , such as the continued occupation of the territories of others , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 July and 31 December 1996 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical , managerial , monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
While it could have opted for forced repatriation , Pakistan had continued to provide for the needs of Afghan refugees with its own resources , despite the enormous administrative , economic and social repercussions their presence in the country and their participation in the economic activities had caused , and the sometimes permanent environmental damage resulting from their concentration in the northern regions of the country . 
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Panama continued that the foregoing provisions would not apply where the domestic legislation of the State did not provide for due process of law with regard to the protection of the right or rights which had allegedly been violated ; the alleged victim of a violation had not been allowed access to domestic remedies , or had been impeded in exhausting such remedies ; there had been unreasonable delay in a decision with regard to domestic remedies .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , the International Civilian Mission in Haiti and United Nations Development Programme technical assistance in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian national police force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalization of the Haitian national police and towards fulfilment of the May 1997 " Haitian national police development plan for 1997-2001 " ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The report of the Special Rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief detailed egregious violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and demonstrated the degree to which that most fundamental human right continued to be breached .  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
The invited experts , who had included members of the Palestinian Council , the Israeli Knesset and the European Parliament and leading academics from different regions , had made presentations in three plenary sessions , which had been followed by lively and frank discussions that had reflected the great concern of all participants that the accords concluded by the parties should be implemented and the peace process continued .  
It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
Mr . Boris Yeltsin and Mr . Leonid D . Kuchma expressed their support for the continued growth of mutual trade , the harmonization of economic relations , the creation of the necessary conditions for establishing mutually advantageous cooperation between economic agents , the settlement of existing disputes in the area of mutual trade , and the speedy removal of artificial trade barriers .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
In contrast to the positions adopted by some human rights bodies which considered that once the reservation was deemed impermissible the reserving State continued to be bound by the treaty as a whole , he emphasized that the treaty was still a consensual instrument , drawing its strength from the will of States . 37 / The reservations made , he said , were consubstantial with the State 's consent to be bound by the treaty . 
It was even more dangerous when information imbalances were accompanied by aggressive policies which violated independence and national sovereignty ; Cuba continued to be the target of radio and television attacks by the Government of the United States of America in open defiance of the elementary norms of coexistence among States and the principles of international law , and despite repeated condemnation by specialized bodies and forums .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
A number of experts expressed concern at the slow and cumbersome procedures which continued to cause considerable delays in moving transit cargo out of the port and across national boundaries .  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .

Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
During the period under review , the Government of Argentina maintained its position that the restoration of communications between the mainland and the Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) continued to be a primary objective , since improved links would produce commercial and economic benefits for the entire region , by creating the necessary framework for achieving a greater understanding between the inhabitants of the region and for serving their interests .

While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .

From that time on , successive economic measures against the Cuban people continued to accumulate until they formed a absolute and total blockade , which went so far as to prevent Cuba from importing even an aspirin produced in the United States , or from exporting to that country a single flower grown in Cuba .  
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
It is significant that throughout the political campaign leading to the first round of general elections , held just 12 days ago , and whose final outcome will be decided in the run-off scheduled for 26 December , each and every one of the political parties , without exception , expressed full support for the implementation of the peace agreements , as well as for the continued presence in Guatemala of the Verification Mission . Indeed , MINUGUA forms an integral part of those Agreements . 
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .

In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA flows , on the other hand , continued to be driven by and large by historical and geographical ties .  
While it is evident that there is a continued need for the international community to support the strengthening of national and local capacities in terms of health _ care expertise , infrastructure and supplies , it is also incumbent upon the national and local authorities to do their part to ensure that what is in principle free access to State _ sponsored medical services actually exists in practice .  
Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .

The laudable initiative of convening a special session on the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits should be continued on an annual basis ; debates should focus on themes agreed in the substantive session , taking into account the need to balance action and experience at the national level with the results and requirements of international cooperation .  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
To cease immediately its continued repressive practices , including the practice of forced deportation and relocation , against the Iraqi Kurds , Assyrians and Turkmen , and against the population of the southern marsh areas , where drainage projects have provoked environmental destruction and a deterioration of the situation of the civilian population , and to ensure the personal integrity and freedoms , including the full freedom of belief , of the Shia and their religious establishment ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;

The continued neglect of the urban waste problem will inevitably have dire consequence with regional and global implications in the not too distant future .  
Sweden has a strong commitment to continued international development cooperation , and we are among those four countries that meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance .

Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Although the least developed countries had launched comprehensive economic and social reform programmes , their socioeconomic decline had continued and the gap between the level of their financial resources and their everincreasing needs was widening .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
If new , more flexible contractual arrangements were to be developed so as to respond to the changing requirements of employing organizations , they would need to be within an overall , standard framework that ensured the continued existence and viability of the international civil service .  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
The continued commitment and patience of the East Timorese and the confirmed strong support of the international community will be essential during this complex period and beyond independence if East Timor is to have a sustainable and democratic future .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
My delegation has also subscribed to the premise that for sanctions to be effective , they must be implemented within a prescribed time frame and be subject to close monitoring and periodic review in order to ensure their continued usefulness and validity , as well as to evaluate their impact on vulnerable populations and neighbouring States .  
In his speech at the beginning of this month at the annual conference of his party , Mr . Tony Blair , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , referring to a moral duty to provide international military and humanitarian assistance to any country in need , stressed that if the world continued to ignore the suffering of the African nations , like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ravaged by war , that would incite anger and frustration that could threaten global stability . 
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
It is appropriate to recall today that , against the backdrop of an Israeli occupation that has continued for several decades , the Government of Ariel Sharon initiated a systematic policy of aggression against the Palestinian people , destroying their property , imposing economic blockades on their towns and villages and collective punishment through the repeated use of excessive and sustained force with all the weapons in the Israeli arsenal , and using force on a daily basis against unarmed Palestinian civilians .  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
On the contrary , arbitrary detentions continued to occur throughout the year , by order of higher authority , which means that imprisonment is decided by the executive power , subject to no control whatsoever by the judicial authorities .  
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
In Australia , where , a few decades previously , the Government had abducted over 100,000 aboriginal children in order to place them with white families , discrimination against and segregation of indigenous people continued and their economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to own land , were restricted . 
The transition to a child rights approach can be hampered by : conservative economic and social policies characterized by paternalism and political patronage ; the insufficient capacity of local-level bodies to assume the new responsibilities ; the continued application of archaic law regarding minors ; resistance to child rights concepts by executive , legislative and / or judicial officials ; and the absence of valid , timely and relevant data and indicators on the fulfilment and violation of rights .  
I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Lebanese Government for the impartial attitude adopted by the United Nations in southern Lebanon following the recent Israeli threats in connection with this matter and to thank the Organization for UNIFILs continued fulfilment of its mandate and , in particular , for the humanitarian assistance and medical care it provides to the local inhabitants and for its active participation in the task of clearing the mines laid by Israel in the area .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Stresses however its deep concern about the continued repression of members of the political opposition and about the detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political , religious and social views and for exercising their right to full and equal participation in public affairs , and calls upon the Government of Cuba to release all those persons ;  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Notes with concern the continued problems related to the rule of law and the functioning of the judiciary , inter alia , of corruption , including interference by the executive with the independence of the judiciary , welcomes the Governments continued commitment to reform the judiciary , commends its current efforts to prepare the laws and codes that are essential components of the basic legal framework , and urges the Government to continue to take the necessary measures to promote the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy and the judicial system as a whole ;  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Recognizing the need for deepening its collective analysis of the many interrelated dimensions of globalization and their implications for the work of the system , ACC continued its reflection during 2000 on the impact of globalization , focusing at its first regular session , on the interrelationships between trade and economic , social and environmental dimensions and on the issue of information technology ( see ACC / 2000 / 4 ) .  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
Using available estimates , a minimum of $ 500-700-million of global funding , on which countries can draw swiftly in order to fill their budgetary gaps , must be generated , and an additional $ 500-800-million will be required to ensure continued accessibility by countries to essential interventions such as safe and efficacious combination drugs ( once current first-line treatments have outlived their usefulness ) or long-lasting insecticide-treated nets .  
In addition to the continued unity of effort of its components , in close cooperation with KFOR , in the crucial period in the run-up to elections , the Mission will require the ongoing support of its activities by the international community , including material support , and , above all , the strong and committed support it has enjoyed from members of the Security Council and Member States since its inception .  
Until these fundamental issues are addressed , local police will not be able to substitute for a continued robust international security presence mandated , staffed and equipped to maintain overall security and provide specific protection to international personnel and property .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
In the field of human rights , the ILO has continued to collaborate with other international organizations on issues such as freedom of association , discrimination in employment and occupation , equal opportunities of men and women in employment , indigenous and tribal peoples , migrant workers , forced labour , child labour , and other questions falling within the mandate of ILO .  
The Council concluded its high-level segment with the adoption of a Ministerial Declaration which expressed grave concern that if current economic trends continued , the majority of African countries would be unable to achieve international development goals .  
While welcoming the investigations into some cases of politically motivated violence , the General Assembly remained concerned at the continued reports of politically motivated violence and intimidation , and urged the Government to undertake further investigations and to take appropriate measures to prevent politically motivated violence and intimidation in the future ; and also reaffirmed the importance of the upcoming communal elections being conducted in a free and fair manner .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
It was also stated that continued discussion on highly theoretical issues related to the topic tended to diminish the relative and fragile clarity which had been achieved and , in this connection , the point was made that approaching the topic in more practical terms could be more conducive to making progress on it .  
The practice is nevertheless being continued ; for example , a competitive examination for English interpreters capable of working from Russian is planned for early 2002 for the candidates being trained in-house in the autumn as well as for other applicants ; an examination for English translators capable of translating from Arabic will be given in February 2002 , and a similar examination for French translators may also be held in 2002 if the competitive examination scheduled for September 2001 does not produce a significant number of successful candidates proficient in Arabic .  
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
The Government of Panama , whose foreign policy is fully engaged in the development of the democratic system and respect for human rights throughout the world , believes that the continued exclusion of the Republic of China from the United Nations system is inconsistent with the principles that underlie the Organizations functioning , the commitment to the democratic system and human rights that the United Nations system proclaims and promotes , and the international realities witnessed by all the peoples of the world .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
Third countries should remain wary of returning certain categories of refugees to Bosnia and Herzegovina , especially when those refugees are determined to be in continued need of international protection by UNHCR or are from such areas where ethnically motivated violations of economic and social rights persists and where there is no true climate of security .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
The continued careful targeting of the limited , uncommitted , voluntary funds will be critical to the recovery of the territorys economic and social sectors and poverty reduction .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
However , over a-billion people had continued to live in extreme poverty , with millions of people unemployed , and a growing number of societies breaking up along racial , ethnic or social fault lines .  
While , by their nature , countries and Governments could be held accountable for compliance with the relevant rules governing the protection of those engaged in humanitarian work , non-State actors continued to show complete disregard for them .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
In conclusion , let me reassure the Assembly of my Governments continued commitment to supporting and expanding the Agencys role in international cooperation in the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation for the benefit of all member States . I would like also to express the Czech Republics appreciation for the personal involvement of the Director General , Mr . Mohamed ElBaradei , in the promotion of the Agencys activities .  
He outlined the main activities undertaken by the secretariat , where priority continued to be given to least developed countries , and the progress achieved with regard to the utilization of developing countries capacities in the implementation of technical cooperation and with respect to the financial sustainability of selected technical cooperation programmes .  
After the so-called end of the cold war , those who continued a military build-up and the development of the most sophisticated means of killing and exterminating human beings were aware that their huge military investments would give them the privilege of imposing their absolute and complete dominance over the other peoples of the world .  
Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance , including both humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Climate change had , among other things , increased the scarcity and diminished the quality of fresh water and had contributed to the degradation of coastal zones and marine ecosystems in all CARICOM member countries , which therefore continued to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Provide a forum for continued policy development and dialogue among Governments , which would involve international organizations and other interested parties , including major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to foster a common understanding on sustainable forest management and to address forest issues and emerging areas of priority concern in a holistic , comprehensive and integrated manner ;
