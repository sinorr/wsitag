As the Chinese military begins to pay close attention to its modernization and strives to catch up to and surpass others in every military aspect , there is a book circulating in China entitled " Chao Xian Zhan " ( " Unrestricted Warfare " ) .  It advances a tactic known as " unrestricted warfare , " and although this is neither a mature thought nor a formal line of thinking in the Chinese military , it nevertheless has evoked broad repercussions .

Nakasone first assigned the Liberal Democratic Party to set up the " Yasukuni Shrine Subcommittee " to find legal grounds for formal visits by officials to Yasukuni Shrine .

Although Hong Kong has not yet established a formal CERC , the normal supporting services of a CERC have , to a certain extent , been provided by the Information Technology Services Department ( ITSD ) and other industrial support organisations like the Hong Kong Productivity Council ( HKPC ) .  These include the issue of warning alert and dissemination of information on the emergence of new computer virus through the media or their web sites , and the provision of advisory services on how the virus should be properly tackled .

" Women have special needs in areas such as physical and mental health , and they face different barriers and difficulties .  These include sexual violence and domestic violence problems , lack of formal education opportunities while they were young , unemployment at middle age , the digital divide , immense pressures faced by working women with dual roles , single parent families lacking sufficient support , as well as difficulties faced by disabled women .  All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .

In the U . S . , the three main TV networks have similar programs , such as " Issues &amp; Answers " on ABC , " Meet the Press " on NBC , and " Face the Nation " On CBS . Government officials in the Republic of China have often appeared on TV , but in most cases they made speeches in a stiff , official manner and confined themselves to formal announcements and outlines rather than giving " inside information " of real interest to the public .  
In the second century AD , the first legendary celestial master , Chang Tao-ling , organized the Taoist religion into a formal system . He added mysterious cults including tien ting ( imperial court ) , chu hsieh ( banishing evil ) , chang sheng ( longevity ) and cheng hsien ( immortality ) to the original ideology .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
This was the first of the " cursive " style of calligraphy , which was a free-flowing , less structured form of character script . This progression marked a radical departure from those first early pictographs which graced the oracle bones . The " standard " script marked the final evolution of formal writing , while a further evolution in the " cursive " style produced the " running " style of calligraphy .  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
However , although formal diplomatic ties have been severed between the United States and our country during the last ten years , substantive relations have not only been maintained , but enhanced immeasurably . This is mainly due to interests shared by the two nations , along with broad support from the American and Chinese people .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
Chen Yu-chun , the director of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Culture University , points out that when the US had formal diplomatic ties and a mutual security treaty with Taiwan , the US stated repeatedly that the treaty applied only to Taiwan and the Pescadores , not to Kinmen and Matsu ( the latter two islands being right on the coast of mainland China , as opposed to the former , which are more distant from the continent ) .  
Later on , despite the establishment of formal governmental offices , the Ching court 's attitude toward Taiwan was merely " to insure that the island remained quiet and posed no threat , " but they had little enthusiasm for positively developing the island . This attitude is evident in the continuing ban on mainland Chinese emigrating to Taiwan even after the integration of the island into the imperial bureaucratic system . ( People got to Taiwan only because the law was not strictly enforced . )  
Having been busy for a while , by the time they got set up for a formal takeoff they noticed the sky darkening . But it proved impossible for them to resist the seduction of flying . "  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
After the head is drawn , the portrait master will need to add a long robe or a suit for the men , a Chinese or Western dress for the ladies . Sometimes , at the request of the client , a gold necklace or ring is added , the subject is made to sit at a formal chair associated with seniority , a vase with flowers is placed beside him or her , or scenes typical of an upper status Chinese family are arranged by the portrait master 's brush .  
In those days everything was at a high standard of performance . Performers had to undertake formal study with a master for three years and four months . The troupes did not hesitate to spend exorbitant amounts on props , costumes , and new scripts and songs . There were also dynamic scenery and props such as " real rainwater pouring down " and " the bottomless coffin " ( so the " deceased " could get out and suddenly pop up elsewhere ) .  
Thirty-nine year old Chuang Yu-long has loved farming since his youth . After graduating from junior high school , he did n't continue formal studies , but took over the family lands , doing endless experiments on how to grow healthy , delicious vegetables and rice without the use of chemical fertilizers , herbicides or pesticides .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Chambers could see how the formal garden was a travesty of nature . Yet the style of Brown , by which it was being replaced , blindly followed nature and lacked any sense of taste . It was , in fact , hard to distinguish from the wilderness . Consisting of a few trees planted on a large grassy slope with a winding narrow path , people were spending a lot of money to produce not much more than an extravagant meadow .  
Their attack on the formal palace garden was used to express their discontent with tyranny . Yet the natural garden , established as it was on the ideal of liberty , could also be used as their safe retreat from the world .  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies . The most feasible way for the ROC to maintain or expand the number of nations with which it has formal ties is to engage in an economic - and trade-based diplomacy that provides these nations with Taiwan 's ample experience in economic development .  
Eighty to ninety percent of the new performers returning to Taiwan from studies abroad were trained in such classes . " Within the formal educational system , specially arranged art and music laboratory classes provide intensive training to develop artistic talents .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
Besides formal competitions and ever more sophisticated and complex chess theories , variations have been developed-like blind chess ( no looking at the board , or even no board at all ) , " hidden " chess ( in which the pieces start turned over and in random positions ) , and pre-arranged endgames . These not only provide entertainment for the individual , but are a recreational activity among friends .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
The situation is also problematic in Africa , another major diplomatic base for Taiwan . Domestic turbulence is rife in Liberia and other countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan , and see-saw struggles between opposing camps pose a big threat to our diplomatic relations . It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
In 1922 , ten literati , alike in disposition and in their shared appreciation of zhou and fine tea , decided to get together . Every couple of days , they would meet up in Shanghai and spend a pleasant day sipping tea and chatting at a teashop . The group did n't emphasize formal etiquette , preferring instead to chat in a relaxed and friendly manner .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 . In 2002 , the Legislative Yuan formally codified a nuclear-free homeland as a strategic objective when it passed the Environmental Basic Law .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
The Taiwanese restaurant Chiangshan Lou , located in the Tataocheng district , with its dignified exterior and luxurious interior , was an important venue for established literati , gentry , and other social elites to hold formal gatherings . Figures like Lin Ya-tang , Lin Hsien-tang , and even members of the royal family of Japan all came here .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
" This type of flexible class would have been impossible before the nine-year integrated curriculum , " says Li . Of course , she also does as is required and teaches three formal biology classes . While these classes may be rigid , she says , they must be attended to , since " if test scores are n't good , students will feel frustrated , and parents will protest . "

The additional standard proposed by his delegation , providing merely for formal equality , might be of more frequent service , especially since it was supported by a vast number of precedents drawn from all the known sources of international law .  
The sheer volume of the report and the figures , set forth in Ambassador Al-Khussaiby 's introduction , of the formal and informal meetings held , the various reports and communications considered , the resolutions adopted and the statements made by the President clearly demonstrate the heavy workload of the Council and illustrate the growing importance of the Security Council in world security issues .  
It is pertinent to indicate that the financial reforms , as the report before us notes , have so far focused almost exclusively on the formal financial sector and have neglected the informal sector with quite a vast savings potential .

For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
The Colloquium took place in agreeable , secluded surroundings which provided an atmosphere conducive to an informal and frank exchange of ideas and experience , further enhanced by unanimous agreement that the Colloquium would depart from the traditional format of United Nations system meetings and eschew the presentation of formal views of individual organizations .  The participants would not present the papers they had prepared , which would serve simply as background documents .

The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .

Abkhazia , as a subject of the federation , will exercise wide discretionary power and will have its own constitution , anthem , flag , emblem , parliament , the highest executive and judicial bodies , and other attributes of statehood , whose competencies will be determined by both the federal and Abkhaz constitutions and through a formal agreement on the delimitation of competencies between the federal State and Abkhazia .

Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
Strategic alliances , however , have several qualities that set them apart from other linkages : they are long-term , they involve " tight operating linkages " , they are based on some kind of formal or tacit agreement and they are underpinned by mutual expectations of continued cooperation .  
Establish , fund and coordinate a sustainable network of accessible facilities and services for emergency and temporary residential accommodation for women and children , for example , " one-stop centres " , where all necessary assistance and services could be made available , including health care , crisis intervention , support , referral and counselling , in matters relating to the lodging of and follow-up to formal complaints , legal aid and court witness assistance , as well as personal protection , child care and earning a livelihood ;

While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .

There has been a rapid expansion in both formal and informal regional arrangements , driven in part by concerns over the potential negative impacts of globalization on national economies and by the positive prospects of regionalization .  
It has been observed that the over-regulated labour market in Latin America has entrenched labour market dualism between a highly protected urban formal sector and a largely unprotected informal sector , thus impeded labour market adjustment to changing market forces .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .

It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .

It advances a tactic known as " unrestricted warfare , " and although this is neither a mature thought nor a formal line of thinking in the Chinese military , it nevertheless has evoked broad repercussions .

Nakasone first assigned the Liberal Democratic Party to set up the " Yasukuni Shrine Subcommittee " to find legal grounds for formal visits by officials to Yasukuni Shrine . Then he established " a discussion meeting regarding officials visiting Yasukuni Shrine " within the cabinet .  On this foundation , Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami announced on 14 August 1985 a reversal of the previous " united interpretation by the government . "

The Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority ( TELA ) has been running training courses for local special effects operators since 1998 .  Trainees will receive provisional recognition if they pass the assessment on their completion of the courses .  Provisionally recognised special effects operators may , within 90 days after the entry into force of the new legislation , apply for a formal licence in the same stream and class of licence as provisionally recognised and will be exempted from separate assessment .  
Although Hong Kong has not yet established a formal CERC , the normal supporting services of a CERC have , to a certain extent , been provided by the Information Technology Services Department ( ITSD ) and other industrial support organisations like the Hong Kong Productivity Council ( HKPC ) .  These include the issue of warning alert and dissemination of information on the emergence of new computer virus through the media or their web sites , and the provision of advisory services on how the virus should be properly tackled .  
He emphasised that , in achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability , mutually reinforcing anchors as well as an enhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas would be required , regardless of the formal institutional division of responsibility .  
" Women have special needs in areas such as physical and mental health , and they face different barriers and difficulties .  These include sexual violence and domestic violence problems , lack of formal education opportunities while they were young , unemployment at middle age , the digital divide , immense pressures faced by working women with dual roles , single parent families lacking sufficient support , as well as difficulties faced by disabled women .  All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .  
" Overall , the survey findings indicated that Project Springboard has achieved its stated objective of providing an alternative path of education for those who had completed Secondary Five with unsatisfactory results and mature students to obtain a formal qualification comparable to five passes in HKCEE , " he added .  
In the U . S . , the three main TV networks have similar programs , such as " Issues &amp; Answers " on ABC , " Meet the Press " on NBC , and " Face the Nation " On CBS . Government officials in the Republic of China have often appeared on TV , but in most cases they made speeches in a stiff , official manner and confined themselves to formal announcements and outlines rather than giving " inside information " of real interest to the public .  
In the second century AD , the first legendary celestial master , Chang Tao-ling , organized the Taoist religion into a formal system . He added mysterious cults including tien ting ( imperial court ) , chu hsieh ( banishing evil ) , chang sheng ( longevity ) and cheng hsien ( immortality ) to the original ideology .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
This was the first of the " cursive " style of calligraphy , which was a free-flowing , less structured form of character script . This progression marked a radical departure from those first early pictographs which graced the oracle bones . The " standard " script marked the final evolution of formal writing , while a further evolution in the " cursive " style produced the " running " style of calligraphy .  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
However , although formal diplomatic ties have been severed between the United States and our country during the last ten years , substantive relations have not only been maintained , but enhanced immeasurably . This is mainly due to interests shared by the two nations , along with broad support from the American and Chinese people .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
Chen Yu-chun , the director of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Culture University , points out that when the US had formal diplomatic ties and a mutual security treaty with Taiwan , the US stated repeatedly that the treaty applied only to Taiwan and the Pescadores , not to Kinmen and Matsu ( the latter two islands being right on the coast of mainland China , as opposed to the former , which are more distant from the continent ) .  
Later on , despite the establishment of formal governmental offices , the Ching court 's attitude toward Taiwan was merely " to insure that the island remained quiet and posed no threat , " but they had little enthusiasm for positively developing the island . This attitude is evident in the continuing ban on mainland Chinese emigrating to Taiwan even after the integration of the island into the imperial bureaucratic system . ( People got to Taiwan only because the law was not strictly enforced . )  
Having been busy for a while , by the time they got set up for a formal takeoff they noticed the sky darkening . But it proved impossible for them to resist the seduction of flying . "  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
After the head is drawn , the portrait master will need to add a long robe or a suit for the men , a Chinese or Western dress for the ladies . Sometimes , at the request of the client , a gold necklace or ring is added , the subject is made to sit at a formal chair associated with seniority , a vase with flowers is placed beside him or her , or scenes typical of an upper status Chinese family are arranged by the portrait master 's brush .  
In those days everything was at a high standard of performance . Performers had to undertake formal study with a master for three years and four months . The troupes did not hesitate to spend exorbitant amounts on props , costumes , and new scripts and songs . There were also dynamic scenery and props such as " real rainwater pouring down " and " the bottomless coffin " ( so the " deceased " could get out and suddenly pop up elsewhere ) .  
Thirty-nine year old Chuang Yu-long has loved farming since his youth . After graduating from junior high school , he did n't continue formal studies , but took over the family lands , doing endless experiments on how to grow healthy , delicious vegetables and rice without the use of chemical fertilizers , herbicides or pesticides .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Chambers could see how the formal garden was a travesty of nature . Yet the style of Brown , by which it was being replaced , blindly followed nature and lacked any sense of taste . It was , in fact , hard to distinguish from the wilderness . Consisting of a few trees planted on a large grassy slope with a winding narrow path , people were spending a lot of money to produce not much more than an extravagant meadow .  
Their attack on the formal palace garden was used to express their discontent with tyranny . Yet the natural garden , established as it was on the ideal of liberty , could also be used as their safe retreat from the world .  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies . The most feasible way for the ROC to maintain or expand the number of nations with which it has formal ties is to engage in an economic - and trade-based diplomacy that provides these nations with Taiwan 's ample experience in economic development .  
Eighty to ninety percent of the new performers returning to Taiwan from studies abroad were trained in such classes . " Within the formal educational system , specially arranged art and music laboratory classes provide intensive training to develop artistic talents .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
Besides formal competitions and ever more sophisticated and complex chess theories , variations have been developed-like blind chess ( no looking at the board , or even no board at all ) , " hidden " chess ( in which the pieces start turned over and in random positions ) , and pre-arranged endgames . These not only provide entertainment for the individual , but are a recreational activity among friends .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
The situation is also problematic in Africa , another major diplomatic base for Taiwan . Domestic turbulence is rife in Liberia and other countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan , and see-saw struggles between opposing camps pose a big threat to our diplomatic relations . It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
In 1922 , ten literati , alike in disposition and in their shared appreciation of zhou and fine tea , decided to get together . Every couple of days , they would meet up in Shanghai and spend a pleasant day sipping tea and chatting at a teashop . The group did n't emphasize formal etiquette , preferring instead to chat in a relaxed and friendly manner .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 . In 2002 , the Legislative Yuan formally codified a nuclear-free homeland as a strategic objective when it passed the Environmental Basic Law .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
The Taiwanese restaurant Chiangshan Lou , located in the Tataocheng district , with its dignified exterior and luxurious interior , was an important venue for established literati , gentry , and other social elites to hold formal gatherings . Figures like Lin Ya-tang , Lin Hsien-tang , and even members of the royal family of Japan all came here .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
" This type of flexible class would have been impossible before the nine-year integrated curriculum , " says Li . Of course , she also does as is required and teaches three formal biology classes . While these classes may be rigid , she says , they must be attended to , since " if test scores are n't good , students will feel frustrated , and parents will protest . "  
With minimal encouragement from external sources , Somalia 's formal and informal private sector in all regions long ago began the task of breathing life into commercial and trading activities .  
The formal - and often informal - privatization of public health facilities and educational institutions in response to the erosion of public funding and spread of private providers has led to rapid social differentiation in education and health .  
Many formal sector firms , private and public , have grown accustomed to protected markets , discriminatory administrative procedures and controlled banking practices , and have problems adjusting to free markets .  
Yet there are numerous exceptions : some enterprises are licensed and regulated ; some use imported raw materials ; some are owned by educated persons ; and some obtain a loan from a formal source of credit . 
Establishment of formal , official and effective public service rules and regulations and a contingent of public servants qualified , capable and skilled in the management of the public administration system in new stages of development ;  
It was recognized that further deliberations on this complex and critical subject would require a set of wellpaced consultations , both formal and informal , over the period leading up to the establishment of the framework at the annual session 1995 .  
The additional standard proposed by his delegation , providing merely for formal equality , might be of more frequent service , especially since it was supported by a vast number of precedents drawn from all the known sources of international law .  
The sheer volume of the report and the figures , set forth in Ambassador Al-Khussaiby 's introduction , of the formal and informal meetings held , the various reports and communications considered , the resolutions adopted and the statements made by the President clearly demonstrate the heavy workload of the Council and illustrate the growing importance of the Security Council in world security issues .  
It is pertinent to indicate that the financial reforms , as the report before us notes , have so far focused almost exclusively on the formal financial sector and have neglected the informal sector with quite a vast savings potential .  
Programmes to support and strengthen equal employment opportunities and equitable remuneration for women in the formal and informal sectors with adequate economic , political and social support systems and services , including child care , particularly day-care facilities and parental leave , and equal access to credit , land and other natural resources ;

The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure , democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;

An urban strategy for the short and medium term should aim at reducing the large numbers of underemployed currently engaged in the so-called informal sector and low-wage services sector by increasing labour absorption in modern formal industry .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Investing in formal and non-formal education and training for girls and women , with its exceptionally high social and economic return , has proved to be one of the best means of achieving [ sustained economic growth and ] [ sustainable development ] [ centred on the human person ] and for eradicating poverty . tertiary education has increased considerably . 
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
The Colloquium took place in agreeable , secluded surroundings which provided an atmosphere conducive to an informal and frank exchange of ideas and experience , further enhanced by unanimous agreement that the Colloquium would depart from the traditional format of United Nations system meetings and eschew the presentation of formal views of individual organizations .  The participants would not present the papers they had prepared , which would serve simply as background documents .  
Delegations are encouraged to request the formal inscription , at least 48 hours prior to the meeting , of specific items they would like to raise in the Committee , keeping in mind the detailed list of topics adopted by the Committee in 1982 ( see document A / 49 / 26 , paragraph 5 ) .

The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Even when , as is more usual , the formal political boundaries remain intact , the ability of capitals of large and relatively homogeneous States to impose a single direction over all their constituent parts is clearly diminishing . 
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan .

Abkhazia , as a subject of the federation , will exercise wide discretionary power and will have its own constitution , anthem , flag , emblem , parliament , the highest executive and judicial bodies , and other attributes of statehood , whose competencies will be determined by both the federal and Abkhaz constitutions and through a formal agreement on the delimitation of competencies between the federal State and Abkhazia .  
There is ample evidence that a weak bureaucracy , coupled with an ineffective judicial system , tends to generate an inefficient implementation of the formal institutional structure .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
Strategic alliances , however , have several qualities that set them apart from other linkages : they are long-term , they involve " tight operating linkages " , they are based on some kind of formal or tacit agreement and they are underpinned by mutual expectations of continued cooperation .  
Establish , fund and coordinate a sustainable network of accessible facilities and services for emergency and temporary residential accommodation for women and children , for example , " one-stop centres " , where all necessary assistance and services could be made available , including health care , crisis intervention , support , referral and counselling , in matters relating to the lodging of and follow-up to formal complaints , legal aid and court witness assistance , as well as personal protection , child care and earning a livelihood ;

While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
A number of innovations were already introduced at the ninth session of the Conference , including reducing documentation ; scaled down formal plenary sessions ; increased use of informal debates , circulated written statements and videotaped interventions ; and remote translation .

The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons .

It has been observed that the over-regulated labour market in Latin America has entrenched labour market dualism between a highly protected urban formal sector and a largely unprotected informal sector , thus impeded labour market adjustment to changing market forces .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .

It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .
