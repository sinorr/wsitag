The special topics on the Chinese economy included a summary on Chinese economic development , the future of Chinese financial reforms , the choice of Chinese foreign exchange rate and trade surplus , and some current hot topics .  Six economists , including Xu Zhenhu , professor at Georgia State University in the United States , had shared their opinions on the issues .  
Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in July last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20-million US dollars in July to 722-million US dollars in December , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .  
Oversupply refers to the excess industrial output capacity and product mix formed by years of blind investment and duplicate construction , as well as a staged surplus of farm products due to successive bumper harvests .  
Hard supply refers to the low-level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form .  Since our market lacks elimination-through-competition forces , with enterprises lacking innovative skills , this hard supply is not corrected promptly and effectively .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
[ Reporter ] At present , our economic development is in a very crucial period .  As the national economy has undergone profound changes and is transforming from the economy of shortage into an economy marked by the buyer 's market , China is confronted with the dilemma of a structure-caused surplus on the one hand and a domestic market with untapped potentials on the other .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
Since large enterprises are not required to exercise the function of bearing the financial burden in supporting social undertakings , the surplus personnel they released have to be digested by small and medium-sized enterprises .  Many new service sectors , such as service units in cities and towns as well as community services , have also relied on the support of small and medium-sized enterprises .  As a developing and rising group , small and medium-sized enterprises have started to show their vitality .  
Faced with the fierce market competition , a multitude of enterprises have focused their efforts on converting their operational mechanisms , intensifying the reforms within themselves , diverting surplus employees by laying them off in order to improve efficiency , and strengthening and improving enterprise management .  They have made strenuous efforts in ending their predicament and raising their competitiveness as quickly as possible .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
On the contrary , the sustained economic growth on the mainland side and the booming cross-strait economic exchanges just played a more and more important positive role for Taiwan 's economy .  This not only guaranteed that Taiwan still maintained a foreign trade surplus and thus alleviated the difficulties that the Taiwan enterprises were facing , but also provided a broader room for maneuver and development prospects for Taiwan 's economic development .  
The target of the military reduction in force is mainly logistic personnel , health personnel , administrative personnel of military organs , " surplus units " that have emerged after the merging and reorganization of military arms and services , and personnel who have completed or who will soon complete their term of military service .  Military reduction in force will not include standing military units and war preparedness duty units .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
The state has clearly laid down : " Defining property rights follows the principle of ' the investor profits , ' " and " that portion of after-tax profits of enterprises owned by the whole people that are formed through the use of state capital and from funds inserted in the course of operations which is , with state permission , retained by the enterprises as increased investment , together with the surplus public funds and undistributed profits drawn from after-tax profits are defined as state assets . "  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
According to experts , China has an ample supply of resources and a surplus of productive capacity .  A buyers ' market is taking shape and there is substantial material guarantee .  An increase in fiscal deficits and government debts can arouse the hidden production factors and stimulate economic growth .  
The rich human resources , high proportion of young and middle-aged population , notable cost advantages , and the state 's measures to lighten the burdens of state-owned enterprises , divert surplus personnel to other jobs , and separate the functions of running social undertakings are all conducive to heightening labor productivity .

In accordance with the arrangements of the central authorities , various localities and departments concerned have accelerated the structural adjustment of agriculture and grain production , persisted in procuring peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices without restriction , increased the intensity of selling grain at favorable prices , tightened the management of grain purchasing funds and grain markets , and pushed forward the reform of grain procuring and marketing enterprises .  
The main problems are : In some localities , the policy of unlimitedly purchasing peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices and quality grain at better prices has not been completely carried out , there are phenomena of restricting or refusing purchases and purchases by lowering the grade and reducing the price , and the continued decline of grain market prices has decreased peasants ' profits in growing grain and dampened their enthusiasm to a certain extent .  
The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;  
China 's agricultural and rural economic development has now entered a new stage , in which farm products , particularly grain , have turned from a long-standing shortage to a basic balance of supply with demand and even a surplus in years of bumper harvests , and agricultural development has changed from being subject to resource restraints to being subject to the dual restraints of resources and markets .  
Our current uncoordinated grain production and marketing structure is a very glaring problem , with a shortage of quality varieties , a surplus of popular and dependable varieties , a lack of adaptation to market demand , and the inability to sell at good prices being the key reasons for the grain selling difficulties and for peasants producing more but earning less .  
In addition , the amounts of these social security funds should be higher than the previous year .  Except for paying expenditures as required by law , the financial surplus should be mainly used for increasing social security funds .  All localities should carry out a comprehensive and careful examination of this year 's collection of various social security funds as well as social security funds for expenditures in local budgets at all levels .  
The policy on purchasing peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices and without limitations not only tallies with the actual conditions in grain production and circulation in our country but is conducive to resolving the contradictions and problems before us and in keeping with the orientation of deepening the reform of the grain circulation system ; it is a long-term , basic policy according to which the state protects the peasants ' interests and maintains agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and which must continue to be implemented to the letter .  
In economic restructuring , there have been marked improvements in the aggregate control of some surplus and obsolete productive capacities and products , such as the textile , coal , metallurgical industries , and the electronic information industry is becoming a new impetus to economic growth .  
The secondary industry which is heavily based on high-tech and advanced sciences provides the real strength behind the tertiary industry 's development , and in turn the tertiary industry 's development provides the vast space and the technological and information services that allow the secondary industry to gear its operating funds to the market , and it also absorbs millions of the secondary industry 's surplus labor force , producing the effect of the secondary and tertiary industries promoting each other 's development .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
As these receipts are expected to moderate , the surplus would narrow automatically in the coming fiscal year , but remain at a comfortable level .  
" We possess strong economic fundamentals , with a high saving rate , large fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves and a remarkable productivity capacity .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .  Year after year , since the linked exchange rate was established , our fiscal reserves every year average about 2% of GDP . And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
For HOS Operating Account , an increase in income is projected for the 1999 / 2000 budget over the revised budget for 1998 / 99 .  However , an increase in expenditure from $ 7.2 billion in 1998 / 99 to $ 17.6 billion in 1999 / 2000 , due to a much higher number of HOS units completed in the coming year , is expected to cause the surplus level to drop by $ 5 billion to $ 10.1 billion .  
For example , foreign banks generally kept much smaller clearing balances because their lack of extensive retail networks made their liquidity less vulnerable to unpredictable swings , and because their dependence on interbank funding implied a higher opportunity cost in holding surplus liquidity than was faced by banks with a sizeable retail deposit base .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus increased to $ 4.1 billion in the first quarter of 1999 .  The net external factor income inflow also rose , to $ 9.3 billion .  
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for 1999 , the Chief Executive of the HKMA , Mr Joseph Yam , said that the 20% increase in accumulated surplus was encouraging , particularly in a very difficult year when rising interest rates resulted in volatile financial conditions .  
As the local and regional economic environment stabilised , Hong Kong recorded a further BoP surplus amounting to $ 1.9 billion , equivalent to 0.6% of GDP , in the second quarter of 1999 .  
The surplus in the second quarter represented the net effect of a visible trade deficit of $ 7.4 billion , an invisible trade surplus of $ 16.9 billion , a net external factor income inflow of $ 4.3 billion , and a net current transfer outflow of $ 2.6 billion .  
Also , this more than offset the deficit in visible trade , giving a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , equivalent to 0.8% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  
Apart from the distinct improvement in the current account surplus in the second half of 1999 upon the sharp rebound in exports of both goods and services , the turnaround in financial flows back to a net inflow towards the year-end also contributed to the marked rise in BoP surplus in the fourth quarter .  
The large current account surplus in 1999 was characterised by a much reduced visible trade deficit , a marked increase in invisible trade surplus , continued net inflow in the factor income account , and continued net outflow in current transfers .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
The resultant surplus for the year of $ 10 billion is marginally higher than the surplus of $ 9.9 billion announced when the provisional figures for the year were published on April 29 pending final closure of the annual accounts . 
Compared with the first quarter of 1999 , the current account surplus in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit , a sustained improvement in invisible trade surplus , a continued net inflow of external factor income , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Exports of services also surged on the back of the robust regional demand , yielding a substantial invisible trade surplus of $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , considerably enlarged from that of $ 14.8 billion in the same quarter in 1999 .  
Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the second quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit and a continued net outflow of current transfers , yet more than offset by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus and a substantial growth in net inflow of external factor income .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2000 with the first quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit was little changed at $ 19.3 billion , while the invisible trade surplus went up from $ 23.8 billion to $ 28.2 billion .  
While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by a substantial rise in invisible trade surplus .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2000 with the second quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 19.3 billion to $ 10.5 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 28.2 billion to $ 31.5 billion .  
A Government secretariat spokesman pointed out that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the third quarter of 2000 , marked by a further increase in the current account surplus and continued net inflow of financial non-reserve assets .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by an increase in invisible trade surplus .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2000 with the third quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 10.5 billion to $ 14.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 32.8 billion to $ 38.9 billion .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's external payments position remained favourable in the fourth quarter of 2000 , characterised by a continued surplus in the current account and a further net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , hence yielding an overall balance of payments surplus .  
This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
Overall , the combined visible and invisible trade account ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) remained in surplus , at $ 2 billion in the first quarter of 2001 , equivalent to 0.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  Yet these were smaller than the corresponding figures of $ 5 billion and 1.3% in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2001 with the fourth quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 14.9 billion to $ 24.6 billion , while the invisible trade surplus was reduced from $ 38.0 billion to $ 26.9 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the first quarter of 2001 , marked by both a continued surplus in the current account and a further considerable net inflow of financial non-reserve assets in the capital and financial account .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) amounting to $ 11.3 billion in the first half of 2001 , equivalent to 1.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Yet the invisible trade surplus expanded further on the back of sustained notable growth in inbound tourism and offshore trade , from $ 28.6 billion in the second quarter of 2000 to $ 32.4 billion in the second quarter of 2001 .  
Comparing the second quarter with the first quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 24.6 billion to $ 23.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 27.5 billion to $ 32.4 billion .  
Apart from the sustained current account surplus , the positive BoP position in the second quarter was also underpinned by a further net inflow of direct investment , signifying continued interest abroad in placing foreign direct investment in Hong Kong , even though concurrently there were net portfolio investment and other investment outflows .  
The coins will bear the standard Bauhinia design on the obverse side .  On the reverse side , there will be special commemorative designs , each depicting one of five traditional blessings or felicitations in Chinese : " May your wishes come true " , " May every year bring a surplus " , " Speedy success " , " Flowers bloom for prosperity " , and " May your stock turn over like a spinning wheel " .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34.2 billion , equivalent to 2.6% of the total value of imports of goods and services , in the first three quarters of 2001 , as compared to $ 36.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in 2000 . 
On this comparison , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2001 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit , an increase in invisible trade surplus , a marked rise in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2001 with the second quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 23.9 billion to $ 11.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 32.8 billion to $ 34.8 billion .  
Compared with the same quarter in 2000 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2001 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , a small increase in invisible trade surplus , a substantial increase in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Overall , a combined visible and invisible trade surplus of $ 34.1 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 , larger than that of $ 20.7 billion in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Amongst the main current account components , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 11.4 billion to $ 5.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 35.1 billion to $ 39.1 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the surplus in the current account rose markedly further in the fourth quarter of 2001 , underpinned by a surge in the combined visible and invisible trade surplus , as well as continued net external factor income inflow .  
Taken together , the combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) rose to $ 20.5 billion in the first quarter of 2002 , equivalent to 5.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services .  This was considerably up from the respective surplus figures of $ 3.2 billion and 0.8% in the same quarter in 2001 .  
Analysed by major component , expenditure on machinery and equipment continued to be held back by an uncertain business outlook , weakened corporate profits , and adjustment to surplus capacity , with a 25.0% plunge in real terms in the first quarter of 2002 over a year earlier .  
Compared with the same quarter in 2001 , the current account surplus in the first quarter of 2002 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , an increase in invisible trade surplus , a rise in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2002 with the fourth quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the current account surplus decreased from $ 41.5 billion to $ 31.8 billion .  
Amongst the main current account components , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.0 billion to $ 12.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 39.5 billion to $ 32.9 billion .  
Moreover , the current account continued to attain a sizeable surplus in the first quarter , underpinned by a marked rise in trade surplus , as well as sustained net external factor income inflow upon notable investment income from the Mainland .  
It has been reported that the Housing Department ( " HD " ) recently discarded several dozen cartons of unused mosaic tiles in Tai Wo Estate , Tai Po , as signs of " ageing " had been found in these mosaic tiles .  These tiles were surplus construction materials handed over to HD by the contractor of the estate for future maintenance of the exterior walls of housing blocks .  
The gross operating surplus of the construction sector , which is equal to gross output less total operating expenditure , decreased by 5% from a year earlier to $ 9.7 billion in 2001 .  
The gross surplus of the transport sector , which is equal to total receipts less operating expenses and compensation of employees , decreased by 19% from a year earlier to $ 33.1 billion in 2001 .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus still expanded , to $ 24.1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 , equivalent to 5.4% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter , from the corresponding surplus figures of $ 18.7 billion and 4.9% in the same quarter in 2002 .  
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2003 with the fourth quarter of 2002 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.6 billion to $ 16.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 52.1 billion to $ 40.1 billion .  
" We have requested SSB operating more than one school to re-deploy surplus teachers to fill available vacancies in member schools , supplemented with additional measures such as disseminating information on teaching vacancies via the Internet , offering a preferential treatment period during which surplus teachers are given the priority to apply directly to schools , arranging group recruitment interviews and encouraging job sharing among teachers .  These are to help those surplus teachers who are genuinely in need of assistance to secure a teaching post as soon as possible . "  
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Although a large number of surplus teachers and fresh graduates of the Hong Kong Institute of Education ( HKIEd ) have indicated that it is difficult to secure a teaching post , I have received complaints that some schools have employed untrained university graduates as " permitted teachers " in the current school year .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Ever since the early days Li has relied on a makeshift approach , surviving from one show to the next with profits serving as funding for the following production . In this way the company has put together eighteen productions with over 400 individual performances , and earned a surplus of NT $ 2 million . Information about their future works that appears in the program notes also indicates how well they plan the year in advance .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Such strategies are however dangerous and difficult to reverse : surplus fishing vessels , once established in a fishery , may be difficult to displace , with limited alternative incomeearning opportunities , and a loss in economic yield will certainly occur .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing up to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable , and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing during the period from 30 September 1974 to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 A of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;

The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
The continued expansion of the aggregate output was accompanied by encouraging development in fiscal performance , with the central government budget operations producing a surplus of EC $ 3.7-million in 1994 as compared with EC $ 2.2-million recorded in 1993 . 
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5.6 million dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 dollars gross ( 10-million dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
In a similar vein , many agricultural products are controlled ( although this is changing rapidly ) with , for example , fixed or minimum or maximum prices , central marketing councils , and surplus removal schemes .  
Moreover , States generally do not keep precise , centralized and accessible records and accounts of existing stocks , including ammunition deemed surplus to national requirements , obsolete or unserviceable .  
The Group is of the opinion that the careful management of worldwide legitimate stocks of ammunition , including the reduction of surplus stocks , combined with active encouragement for former combatants to hand over their stocks for destruction , can reduce the negative impact of the uncontrolled proliferation of ammunition in post-conflict areas .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
It is generally acknowledged that a comparative income approach is not feasible because of the inability to separate out the implicit unit price and quantity elements , especially in the case of gross or net operating surplus .  
In 1995 , Act No . 19 , 381 was published ; the Act increased some of the entitlements for male and female participants and regulated such areas as the authority of the Superintendency ; participants right to claim any surplus between their legal contribution and the cost of their agreed health plans ; increased access of participants to information ; regulation of coverage limits ; and exclusions .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
Develop and adopt effective programmes for the collection , safe storage , destruction and responsible disposal of firearms rendered surplus , redundant or obsolete through , inter alia , peace agreements , demobilization or integration of ex-combatants or re-equipping or restructuring of national armed forces or armed State bodies ;  
The balance of the appropriations remaining unobligated at the close of the financial period , after deducting therefrom any contributions from States Parties relating to that financial year which remain unpaid , shall form part of any cash surplus of the budget and shall be treated in accordance with regulation 4.4 bis .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided in regulation 4.3 , the then remaining unspent balance of appropriations retained after deducting therefrom any contributions from States Parties relating to the financial period of the appropriations which remain unpaid shall be treated as a cash surplus as in regulation 4.3 .  
To regularly review the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks surplus to requirements are clearly identified , [ and that programmes for the responsible and expeditious disposal , normally through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented ] and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
On 25 September 2000 , the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs represented the Secretary-General at a ceremony entitled Flamme de la Paix ( Flame of Peace ) in Agadez , during which surplus and unwanted weapons collected during the peace process in Niger following the Tuareg rebellion in the northern part of the country were destroyed in the presence of the different parties and representatives of the international community . 
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
By the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged States in a position to do so to take appropriate national measures to destroy surplus , confiscated or collected small arms and light weapons , and to provide , on a voluntary basis , information to the Secretary-General on the types and quantities of arms destroyed as well as the methods of their destruction , and requested the Secretary-General to circulate this information annually to all States .  
Such measures are , inter alia , collection and responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered ; confidence-building measures ; disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants ; demining ; and conversion ,  
The special topics on the Chinese economy included a summary on Chinese economic development , the future of Chinese financial reforms , the choice of Chinese foreign exchange rate and trade surplus , and some current hot topics .  Six economists , including Xu Zhenhu , professor at Georgia State University in the United States , had shared their opinions on the issues .  
Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in July last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20-million US dollars in July to 722-million US dollars in December , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .  
Oversupply refers to the excess industrial output capacity and product mix formed by years of blind investment and duplicate construction , as well as a staged surplus of farm products due to successive bumper harvests .  
Hard supply refers to the low-level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form .  Since our market lacks elimination-through-competition forces , with enterprises lacking innovative skills , this hard supply is not corrected promptly and effectively .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
[ Reporter ] At present , our economic development is in a very crucial period .  As the national economy has undergone profound changes and is transforming from the economy of shortage into an economy marked by the buyer 's market , China is confronted with the dilemma of a structure-caused surplus on the one hand and a domestic market with untapped potentials on the other .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
Since large enterprises are not required to exercise the function of bearing the financial burden in supporting social undertakings , the surplus personnel they released have to be digested by small and medium-sized enterprises .  Many new service sectors , such as service units in cities and towns as well as community services , have also relied on the support of small and medium-sized enterprises .  As a developing and rising group , small and medium-sized enterprises have started to show their vitality .  
Faced with the fierce market competition , a multitude of enterprises have focused their efforts on converting their operational mechanisms , intensifying the reforms within themselves , diverting surplus employees by laying them off in order to improve efficiency , and strengthening and improving enterprise management .  They have made strenuous efforts in ending their predicament and raising their competitiveness as quickly as possible .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
On the contrary , the sustained economic growth on the mainland side and the booming cross-strait economic exchanges just played a more and more important positive role for Taiwan 's economy .  This not only guaranteed that Taiwan still maintained a foreign trade surplus and thus alleviated the difficulties that the Taiwan enterprises were facing , but also provided a broader room for maneuver and development prospects for Taiwan 's economic development .  
The target of the military reduction in force is mainly logistic personnel , health personnel , administrative personnel of military organs , " surplus units " that have emerged after the merging and reorganization of military arms and services , and personnel who have completed or who will soon complete their term of military service .  Military reduction in force will not include standing military units and war preparedness duty units .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
The state has clearly laid down : " Defining property rights follows the principle of ' the investor profits , ' " and " that portion of after-tax profits of enterprises owned by the whole people that are formed through the use of state capital and from funds inserted in the course of operations which is , with state permission , retained by the enterprises as increased investment , together with the surplus public funds and undistributed profits drawn from after-tax profits are defined as state assets . "  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
According to experts , China has an ample supply of resources and a surplus of productive capacity .  A buyers ' market is taking shape and there is substantial material guarantee .  An increase in fiscal deficits and government debts can arouse the hidden production factors and stimulate economic growth .  
The rich human resources , high proportion of young and middle-aged population , notable cost advantages , and the state 's measures to lighten the burdens of state-owned enterprises , divert surplus personnel to other jobs , and separate the functions of running social undertakings are all conducive to heightening labor productivity .

In accordance with the arrangements of the central authorities , various localities and departments concerned have accelerated the structural adjustment of agriculture and grain production , persisted in procuring peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices without restriction , increased the intensity of selling grain at favorable prices , tightened the management of grain purchasing funds and grain markets , and pushed forward the reform of grain procuring and marketing enterprises .  
The main problems are : In some localities , the policy of unlimitedly purchasing peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices and quality grain at better prices has not been completely carried out , there are phenomena of restricting or refusing purchases and purchases by lowering the grade and reducing the price , and the continued decline of grain market prices has decreased peasants ' profits in growing grain and dampened their enthusiasm to a certain extent .  
The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;  
China 's agricultural and rural economic development has now entered a new stage , in which farm products , particularly grain , have turned from a long-standing shortage to a basic balance of supply with demand and even a surplus in years of bumper harvests , and agricultural development has changed from being subject to resource restraints to being subject to the dual restraints of resources and markets .  
Our current uncoordinated grain production and marketing structure is a very glaring problem , with a shortage of quality varieties , a surplus of popular and dependable varieties , a lack of adaptation to market demand , and the inability to sell at good prices being the key reasons for the grain selling difficulties and for peasants producing more but earning less .  
In addition , the amounts of these social security funds should be higher than the previous year .  Except for paying expenditures as required by law , the financial surplus should be mainly used for increasing social security funds .  All localities should carry out a comprehensive and careful examination of this year 's collection of various social security funds as well as social security funds for expenditures in local budgets at all levels .  
The policy on purchasing peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices and without limitations not only tallies with the actual conditions in grain production and circulation in our country but is conducive to resolving the contradictions and problems before us and in keeping with the orientation of deepening the reform of the grain circulation system ; it is a long-term , basic policy according to which the state protects the peasants ' interests and maintains agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and which must continue to be implemented to the letter .  
In economic restructuring , there have been marked improvements in the aggregate control of some surplus and obsolete productive capacities and products , such as the textile , coal , metallurgical industries , and the electronic information industry is becoming a new impetus to economic growth .  
The secondary industry which is heavily based on high-tech and advanced sciences provides the real strength behind the tertiary industry 's development , and in turn the tertiary industry 's development provides the vast space and the technological and information services that allow the secondary industry to gear its operating funds to the market , and it also absorbs millions of the secondary industry 's surplus labor force , producing the effect of the secondary and tertiary industries promoting each other 's development .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
As these receipts are expected to moderate , the surplus would narrow automatically in the coming fiscal year , but remain at a comfortable level .  
" We possess strong economic fundamentals , with a high saving rate , large fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves and a remarkable productivity capacity .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .  Year after year , since the linked exchange rate was established , our fiscal reserves every year average about 2% of GDP . And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
For HOS Operating Account , an increase in income is projected for the 1999 / 2000 budget over the revised budget for 1998 / 99 .  However , an increase in expenditure from $ 7.2 billion in 1998 / 99 to $ 17.6 billion in 1999 / 2000 , due to a much higher number of HOS units completed in the coming year , is expected to cause the surplus level to drop by $ 5 billion to $ 10.1 billion .  
For example , foreign banks generally kept much smaller clearing balances because their lack of extensive retail networks made their liquidity less vulnerable to unpredictable swings , and because their dependence on interbank funding implied a higher opportunity cost in holding surplus liquidity than was faced by banks with a sizeable retail deposit base .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus increased to $ 4.1 billion in the first quarter of 1999 .  The net external factor income inflow also rose , to $ 9.3 billion .  
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for 1999 , the Chief Executive of the HKMA , Mr Joseph Yam , said that the 20% increase in accumulated surplus was encouraging , particularly in a very difficult year when rising interest rates resulted in volatile financial conditions .  
As the local and regional economic environment stabilised , Hong Kong recorded a further BoP surplus amounting to $ 1.9 billion , equivalent to 0.6% of GDP , in the second quarter of 1999 .  
The surplus in the second quarter represented the net effect of a visible trade deficit of $ 7.4 billion , an invisible trade surplus of $ 16.9 billion , a net external factor income inflow of $ 4.3 billion , and a net current transfer outflow of $ 2.6 billion .  
Also , this more than offset the deficit in visible trade , giving a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , equivalent to 0.8% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  
Apart from the distinct improvement in the current account surplus in the second half of 1999 upon the sharp rebound in exports of both goods and services , the turnaround in financial flows back to a net inflow towards the year-end also contributed to the marked rise in BoP surplus in the fourth quarter .  
The large current account surplus in 1999 was characterised by a much reduced visible trade deficit , a marked increase in invisible trade surplus , continued net inflow in the factor income account , and continued net outflow in current transfers .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
The resultant surplus for the year of $ 10 billion is marginally higher than the surplus of $ 9.9 billion announced when the provisional figures for the year were published on April 29 pending final closure of the annual accounts . 
Compared with the first quarter of 1999 , the current account surplus in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit , a sustained improvement in invisible trade surplus , a continued net inflow of external factor income , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Exports of services also surged on the back of the robust regional demand , yielding a substantial invisible trade surplus of $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , considerably enlarged from that of $ 14.8 billion in the same quarter in 1999 .  
Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the second quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit and a continued net outflow of current transfers , yet more than offset by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus and a substantial growth in net inflow of external factor income .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2000 with the first quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit was little changed at $ 19.3 billion , while the invisible trade surplus went up from $ 23.8 billion to $ 28.2 billion .  
While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by a substantial rise in invisible trade surplus .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2000 with the second quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 19.3 billion to $ 10.5 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 28.2 billion to $ 31.5 billion .  
A Government secretariat spokesman pointed out that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the third quarter of 2000 , marked by a further increase in the current account surplus and continued net inflow of financial non-reserve assets .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by an increase in invisible trade surplus .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2000 with the third quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 10.5 billion to $ 14.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 32.8 billion to $ 38.9 billion .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's external payments position remained favourable in the fourth quarter of 2000 , characterised by a continued surplus in the current account and a further net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , hence yielding an overall balance of payments surplus .  
This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
Overall , the combined visible and invisible trade account ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) remained in surplus , at $ 2 billion in the first quarter of 2001 , equivalent to 0.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  Yet these were smaller than the corresponding figures of $ 5 billion and 1.3% in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2001 with the fourth quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 14.9 billion to $ 24.6 billion , while the invisible trade surplus was reduced from $ 38.0 billion to $ 26.9 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the first quarter of 2001 , marked by both a continued surplus in the current account and a further considerable net inflow of financial non-reserve assets in the capital and financial account .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) amounting to $ 11.3 billion in the first half of 2001 , equivalent to 1.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Yet the invisible trade surplus expanded further on the back of sustained notable growth in inbound tourism and offshore trade , from $ 28.6 billion in the second quarter of 2000 to $ 32.4 billion in the second quarter of 2001 .  
Comparing the second quarter with the first quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 24.6 billion to $ 23.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 27.5 billion to $ 32.4 billion .  
Apart from the sustained current account surplus , the positive BoP position in the second quarter was also underpinned by a further net inflow of direct investment , signifying continued interest abroad in placing foreign direct investment in Hong Kong , even though concurrently there were net portfolio investment and other investment outflows .  
The coins will bear the standard Bauhinia design on the obverse side .  On the reverse side , there will be special commemorative designs , each depicting one of five traditional blessings or felicitations in Chinese : " May your wishes come true " , " May every year bring a surplus " , " Speedy success " , " Flowers bloom for prosperity " , and " May your stock turn over like a spinning wheel " .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34.2 billion , equivalent to 2.6% of the total value of imports of goods and services , in the first three quarters of 2001 , as compared to $ 36.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in 2000 . 
On this comparison , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2001 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit , an increase in invisible trade surplus , a marked rise in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2001 with the second quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 23.9 billion to $ 11.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 32.8 billion to $ 34.8 billion .  
Compared with the same quarter in 2000 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2001 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , a small increase in invisible trade surplus , a substantial increase in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Overall , a combined visible and invisible trade surplus of $ 34.1 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 , larger than that of $ 20.7 billion in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Amongst the main current account components , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 11.4 billion to $ 5.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 35.1 billion to $ 39.1 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the surplus in the current account rose markedly further in the fourth quarter of 2001 , underpinned by a surge in the combined visible and invisible trade surplus , as well as continued net external factor income inflow .  
Taken together , the combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) rose to $ 20.5 billion in the first quarter of 2002 , equivalent to 5.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services .  This was considerably up from the respective surplus figures of $ 3.2 billion and 0.8% in the same quarter in 2001 .  
Analysed by major component , expenditure on machinery and equipment continued to be held back by an uncertain business outlook , weakened corporate profits , and adjustment to surplus capacity , with a 25.0% plunge in real terms in the first quarter of 2002 over a year earlier .  
Compared with the same quarter in 2001 , the current account surplus in the first quarter of 2002 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , an increase in invisible trade surplus , a rise in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2002 with the fourth quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the current account surplus decreased from $ 41.5 billion to $ 31.8 billion .  
Amongst the main current account components , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.0 billion to $ 12.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 39.5 billion to $ 32.9 billion .  
Moreover , the current account continued to attain a sizeable surplus in the first quarter , underpinned by a marked rise in trade surplus , as well as sustained net external factor income inflow upon notable investment income from the Mainland .  
It has been reported that the Housing Department ( " HD " ) recently discarded several dozen cartons of unused mosaic tiles in Tai Wo Estate , Tai Po , as signs of " ageing " had been found in these mosaic tiles .  These tiles were surplus construction materials handed over to HD by the contractor of the estate for future maintenance of the exterior walls of housing blocks .  
The gross operating surplus of the construction sector , which is equal to gross output less total operating expenditure , decreased by 5% from a year earlier to $ 9.7 billion in 2001 .  
The gross surplus of the transport sector , which is equal to total receipts less operating expenses and compensation of employees , decreased by 19% from a year earlier to $ 33.1 billion in 2001 .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus still expanded , to $ 24.1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 , equivalent to 5.4% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter , from the corresponding surplus figures of $ 18.7 billion and 4.9% in the same quarter in 2002 .  
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2003 with the fourth quarter of 2002 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.6 billion to $ 16.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 52.1 billion to $ 40.1 billion .  
" We have requested SSB operating more than one school to re-deploy surplus teachers to fill available vacancies in member schools , supplemented with additional measures such as disseminating information on teaching vacancies via the Internet , offering a preferential treatment period during which surplus teachers are given the priority to apply directly to schools , arranging group recruitment interviews and encouraging job sharing among teachers .  These are to help those surplus teachers who are genuinely in need of assistance to secure a teaching post as soon as possible . "  
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Although a large number of surplus teachers and fresh graduates of the Hong Kong Institute of Education ( HKIEd ) have indicated that it is difficult to secure a teaching post , I have received complaints that some schools have employed untrained university graduates as " permitted teachers " in the current school year .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Ever since the early days Li has relied on a makeshift approach , surviving from one show to the next with profits serving as funding for the following production . In this way the company has put together eighteen productions with over 400 individual performances , and earned a surplus of NT $ 2 million . Information about their future works that appears in the program notes also indicates how well they plan the year in advance .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Such strategies are however dangerous and difficult to reverse : surplus fishing vessels , once established in a fishery , may be difficult to displace , with limited alternative incomeearning opportunities , and a loss in economic yield will certainly occur .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing up to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable , and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing during the period from 30 September 1974 to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 A of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;  
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing during the period from 30 September 1974 to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 A of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
The continued expansion of the aggregate output was accompanied by encouraging development in fiscal performance , with the central government budget operations producing a surplus of EC $ 3.7-million in 1994 as compared with EC $ 2.2-million recorded in 1993 . 
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5,600,000 United States dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 United States dollars gross ( 10,000,000 dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
Decides that the financing of the appropriation for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1998 under the Special Account for the International Tribunal shall take into account the cumulative surplus fund balance of 5.6 million dollars as at 31 December 1995 and the anticipated availability of an unencumbered balance of 10,873,800 dollars gross ( 10-million dollars net ) for 1997 , and shall be set off against the aggregate amount of the appropriation , as detailed in the annex to the present resolution ;  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
In a similar vein , many agricultural products are controlled ( although this is changing rapidly ) with , for example , fixed or minimum or maximum prices , central marketing councils , and surplus removal schemes .  
Moreover , States generally do not keep precise , centralized and accessible records and accounts of existing stocks , including ammunition deemed surplus to national requirements , obsolete or unserviceable .  
The Group is of the opinion that the careful management of worldwide legitimate stocks of ammunition , including the reduction of surplus stocks , combined with active encouragement for former combatants to hand over their stocks for destruction , can reduce the negative impact of the uncontrolled proliferation of ammunition in post-conflict areas .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
It is generally acknowledged that a comparative income approach is not feasible because of the inability to separate out the implicit unit price and quantity elements , especially in the case of gross or net operating surplus .  
In 1995 , Act No . 19 , 381 was published ; the Act increased some of the entitlements for male and female participants and regulated such areas as the authority of the Superintendency ; participants right to claim any surplus between their legal contribution and the cost of their agreed health plans ; increased access of participants to information ; regulation of coverage limits ; and exclusions .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
Develop and adopt effective programmes for the collection , safe storage , destruction and responsible disposal of firearms rendered surplus , redundant or obsolete through , inter alia , peace agreements , demobilization or integration of ex-combatants or re-equipping or restructuring of national armed forces or armed State bodies ;  
The balance of the appropriations remaining unobligated at the close of the financial period , after deducting therefrom any contributions from States Parties relating to that financial year which remain unpaid , shall form part of any cash surplus of the budget and shall be treated in accordance with regulation 4.4 bis .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided in regulation 4.3 , the then remaining unspent balance of appropriations retained after deducting therefrom any contributions from States Parties relating to the financial period of the appropriations which remain unpaid shall be treated as a cash surplus as in regulation 4.3 .  
To regularly review the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks surplus to requirements are clearly identified , [ and that programmes for the responsible and expeditious disposal , normally through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented ] and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
On 25 September 2000 , the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs represented the Secretary-General at a ceremony entitled Flamme de la Paix ( Flame of Peace ) in Agadez , during which surplus and unwanted weapons collected during the peace process in Niger following the Tuareg rebellion in the northern part of the country were destroyed in the presence of the different parties and representatives of the international community . 
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
By the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged States in a position to do so to take appropriate national measures to destroy surplus , confiscated or collected small arms and light weapons , and to provide , on a voluntary basis , information to the Secretary-General on the types and quantities of arms destroyed as well as the methods of their destruction , and requested the Secretary-General to circulate this information annually to all States .  
Such measures are , inter alia , collection and responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered ; confidence-building measures ; disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants ; demining ; and conversion ,
