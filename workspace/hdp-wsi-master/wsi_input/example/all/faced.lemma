Addressing an informal meeting of the Working Group in New York on 14 September 2001 , the Commissioner-General of UNRWA said that , as in previous years , the Agency faced not only a budgetary deficit of $ 31-million , but also was concerned about a very low cash position which threatened the ability of UNRWA to meet its commitments in the remaining quarter of 2001 .  
In real terms , that represented a negative growth of 3 per cent per annum , as the Agency faced an annual growth of 3.5 per cent in its clientele population driving a similar growth in staff and financial requirements , and an annual weighted average rate of inflation in the UNRWA area of operations at 4 per cent .

Experts mentioned the following as being among the specific difficulties faced by SMEs : demand volatility , and the consequent lack of transparency and predictability in the business environment ; large capital requirements ; weak linkages with international markets ; scarce information about commercial opportunities abroad ; and the difficulty in finding highly trained personnel .  
We stress that determining the future of Afghanistan is the exclusive and inalienable right of the Afghans themselves , who are faced with the task of building a renewed State that lives in peace and harmony with its neighbours and the international community as a whole , and we call for increased humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and the elaboration of a broad international programme for the post-war restoration of Afghanistans national economy .
