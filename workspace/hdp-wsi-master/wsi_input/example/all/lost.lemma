First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .

The basis for the economic expert 's judgment is that the principal administrator is formulating policies on " political correctness . "  As a result , professional bureaucrats have lost their functions , the capable people have remained silent , and those who curry favor with the authorities for personal gain have followed the direction where the wind blows , thus resulting in corrupt political practice .  
Recognizing this point , the contradictory standoff between social groups and government by political parties has lost the overriding standard of evaluation and criterion for constraint , has become muddled , and everything is like shifting sands and drifting clouds , completely without a common direction .  
It also believes the pro-unification forces , which once had the legal basis and rationality on their side , have basically lost their public identity .

Hong Kong is a society ruled by law .  However , because of the adverse currents created by those politicians , who call themselves " democrats , " who fight China , make troubles in Hong Kong , and " overthrow Tung Chee-hwa , " this society has lost its harmony and is replete with reckless behaviors .  Currently some Legco members of the " democratic faction " have even taken the lead in violating the law and rebuffing the rule of law in our special administrative region .

During the cold winter season it lost all its leaves , and only barren branches are left to wait for the spring . As I watch them , the withered branches seem especially strong and unyielding in the dark . Some of the branches bud early and are soon covered with tender green leaves , transparent , smooth and clean . The veins on each heart-shaped leaf are clear to the scrutiny of night .  
Things seemed to be going smoothly enough amid a pleasantly harmonious atmosphere .

It was in this environment that Needham used his prestige as a famous Western scientist . He not only stressed to those around him that " bombs were originally invented in China " but even suggested that if the Chinese had not invented gunpowder and cannon then the feudal warlords of medieval Europe would never have lost their castles , feudalism would not have been dissolved and the following social changes - - the rise of the bourgeoisie and the scientific revolution - - might not have happened .

Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
" The age of the solo aerial combat hero is over , the tendency in the modern air force is towards group tactics requiring a high level of coordination between friendly aircraft .

" In a real combat situation , that would mean being shot down and killed . "  
That he could return to his homeland was naturally some consolation to him in his final years , but it is still a pity that Eight Virtues Garden lost its owner and was expropriated so soon .

China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost .

Finding an heir in a test tube : Even though Taiwan 's in vitro fertilization technology has reached an international standard , Liu Chi-hung feels concern that little attention is paid within the country to basic research .

"  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing .

Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives .

Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
But Teng Shu-ping is also painfully aware that many of these jade artifacts have been illegally dug up and sold in mainland China , and not excavated by expert archaeologists .

" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over .

" The three military opera troupes used to be cultural products forcibly cultivated by the government .

However , money is not static . It ebbs and flows like water , and if for a while it is silent or flows out of the country this does not mean that its power has been lost , all the more so since exchange rates and tariffs have become more reasonable and are unlikely to once again become a major factor depressing prices . If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ?

Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .

Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
Director of the Chunghwa Telecom union Chang Hsu-chung said : " We have become too used to being the dominant player in the market . The result of slack internal management , laziness and shirking in state-owned enterprises is that employees have become like a frog in warm water waiting to be slowly boiled . Because we are too used to a cosy , comfortable life we have lost our vitality . "  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices .

Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
Haucha elder Kuo Chin-ting says that in the past , people usually avoided swamps , which were overgrown with plants and easy to get lost in . Over time , by oral tradition ( the equivalent of tribal law ) , these became taboo areas .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
Other possible symptoms include feelings of alienation , emotional withdrawal and a loss of interest in life . Some victims become hypersensitive , anxious , insomniac , unable to focus their attention and subject to memory lapses . Those who have lost a loved one or who themselves survived a disaster are particularly prone to feeling guilty about their own survival when others died .  
Soldiers who had been exposed to the horrors of trench warfare , the constant threat of death , who had seen their brothers-in-arms wounded and killed while they themselves were unable to do anything about it , would shout and cry hysterically , or become suddenly rigid . Their personalities changed ; they became silent and unresponsive . Some even lost their memories or their senses .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead . Although a museum was established , as a consequence it lost its potential local commemorative significance .  
In the end Frank Hsieh won by a tiny margin of just over 4,000 votes . Political observer and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Chen Mau-hsiung has argued that Wu Den-yih originally held the upper hand in the election , but lost women 's votes as a result of the tape-recording affair . In contrast , the later video merely compounded the dissatisfaction of the electorate , contributing to the DPP gaining control in southern Taiwan .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
Hsiao Lin says that as soon as she removed her clothes , her friend Rongrong got all stone-faced , as if given a frightful scare . Previously , in women 's club meetings at school she was always full of righteous opinion on body issues , demonstrating far-left thinking , and prior to the photo shoot they had engaged in quite a bit of discussion and joked around a lot . So it came as a surprise when Rongrong " lost her wits " when it came down to real business .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
Ban Zhao herself was a thoroughly upper-class woman . Her father and older brother were both famous historians . Although she lost her husband at an early age and thus experienced little of marital bliss , she no doubt found considerable fulfillment in her very active life as a writer . She finished the writing of Ba Biao and Tianwen Zhi , both of which had been started by her father and continued by her brother .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color . As a result of these efforts , however , he later developed cataracts and lost his sight .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
This accounts for the lustrous , vibrant quality of the tricolor glazed pottery of the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , though the fact that tricolor pottery was fired at less than 1000 _ C meant it was prone to break . Also , the finished works differed widely from each other depending on the quality of the clay , the type of glaze , the temperature and even the kind of chimney in the kiln . At higher temperatures , for example , the glaze lost its fluidity .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
Music also interferes with the contemplative process of liberating oneself from worldly concerns , and even Mahakasyapa , who always accompanied the Buddha , was unable to calm down when preaching to the lovely sound of a zither-while the other 500 divine beings present simply lost their heads and started dancing . When former music students take monastic vows they renounce forever their beloved pianos and violins , because everything makes way for the overriding priority of breaking the cycle of rebirth .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
His son , who is in senior high school , once reached 90 kilos in weight , and was depressed and constantly lethargic . A friend introduced Huang junior to replacement-meal " shakes , " and in a month he lost 12 kilos . After this , Huang Pin-hung himself began drinking the liquid meals , accompanied by a regime of light , mildly spiced foods and jogging , and he too reduced his weight from 76 to 66 kilos .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
But those workers who have lost their jobs are quite a different group from the workers in such urgent demand in industry . Michael Hsiao pointed out that those who are out of work have lost their jobs because changes in Taiwan 's industrial structure have made their skills obsolete . Continuing the restructuring of local industry is not going to create jobs for this group . Hsiao argued that the government should instead address the unemployment problem through social assistance measures , and the shortage of workers in key industries through economic policy .  
Stanley Yen complained that once the tourism industry finally got a school established to train professional chefs , the structure of Taiwan 's tertiary education system changed and many technical junior colleges were redesignated as four-year colleges . As a result , the most talented graduates of the cooking school ended up teaching rather than working in food services , and Taiwan lost its opportunity to produce international-caliber chefs .  
Thereafter Taiwan 's economy was transformed from relying mainly on agriculture to one dominated by light industry , and forestry lost its former importance . Forestry policy was changed from maximizing production to cutting of timber only on small areas in a planned way .  
Under the WTO regime , Japan again lost in arbitration over complaints brought by foreign countries . WTO rulings are more enforceable , so within 15 months of the ruling Japan raised taxes on sake and somewhat lowered tariffs on imports of hard liquor . Nonetheless , by hemming and hawing , Japan put off raising taxes on sake for more than a decade .  
While Lai was in Japan he pored over the ancient Records of Artisanry , pondering and experimenting continuously in an effort to resurrect the long lost technique . But for years he was frustrated . Then , serendipity struck in 1986 . While making a wood base , he mixed the thinner left over from the day before into his lacquer .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
The odd thing is that precisely because Taiwan 's public health system was so successful in the past-because the " enemy " had been defeated in every battle-people became inattentive to public health . As time went on , frontline public health personnel neglected their training and lost completely their fighting edge .  
The Nationalist government 's Taiwan policy at that time was to reverse the Japanization of the island , and shortly after the end of the war it banned the use of Japanese . Authors who wrote in Japanese lost their medium , and the Taiwanese people , most of whom were as yet unfamiliar with Mandarin , became effectively illiterate . In short , the policy wrought cultural havoc on Taiwanese society .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
At the end of November , the Legislative Yuan was buzzing as legislators rushed to get key bills affecting the nation 's future and the economy passed . Legislative assistants ( LAs ) , responsible for helping their respective party caucuses negotiate the content of legislation and then mobilize legislators to vote on it , lost track of time and many could be found wandering around enveloped in a haze of exhaustion .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory . In recent years he has taken a succession of odd jobs to make ends meet . Currently he is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the children . Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
Of the 34 lighthouses Taiwan has built on its coasts and nearby islands , Huang Ching-jung has been a keeper for 27 , more than any other person in the country . Forty-five of the 75 years of his life have been spent among the lighthouses . Although he has been retired for ten years , Huang has still not lost his feeling for the lighthouses . He uses discarded pipes to make models of the lighthouses that he puts in his home , and in many dreams late at night he is still connected to the lighthouses .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
As the old Chinese saying goes , " weather has unexpected twists ; fortunes can turn in a day . " Just one example : A man living in Taipei City 's Anping Borough who supported his family by cleaning building exteriors lost his footing in January and fell to his death , leaving behind a disabled wife and three young children . There was n't even enough money for the funeral , and the fatherless family suddenly found itself in the direst of straits .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
The most exciting game was that against Japan , which went into extra innings , with Chinese Taipei being clipped by only a single run . Head coach Hsu Sheng-ming said that although the team lost , no one had even expected it to give Japan much of a fight , so their efforts both at the plate and in the field were very admirable . Star pitcher Tsao Chin-hui threw until his hand blistered and began bleeding , giving an idea of the determination shown by the whole squad .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
There used to be a craftswoman in Chiayi who specialized in making these fans . When she died about 20 years ago the craft was lost , but demand for the fans has grown along with the numbers of the troupes performing . Hence , Chen studied how to make them , and after 20 years of intense research has become the undisputed leading maker of these fans .  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
It may have been because she was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery , but Fu Chieh left her knapsack on a mountain top . She only noticed that she 'd lost it when we planned to go the free market . We rushed back to the mountain to look for the knapsack , and came across a good-hearted person who had found it and who returned it to Fu Chieh . This was one of several pleasant surprises during this trip .

As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .

Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .

A schoolmate of mine who was put in a class for gifted students and then ranked low on several tests began to doubt her abilities , which she had always been praised for . She lost all her self - esteem , tested poorly into high school and later even dropped out . She changed completely for the worse . She became antisocial and terribly defensive , " she relates sadly . "  
Thus when the fifteenth day of the seventh month rolls around , the common people in turn extend a hand to lost , roaming souls of the dead who are commonly called " the good fellows . " Those temples which perform special rituals will erect a twenty-or thirty-foot-high lantern pole , and stick on bamboo leaves , and inscriptions honoring the Three Magistrates are written on the lanterns . The higher the lantern tower and the more lost souls attracted , the greater the merit accrued .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior . Besides , most of the rock gets smashed and lost , so that only ten or twenty percent is actually worth keeping .  
For example , one could use those nearly indestructible rubber baseballs - - they 're very cheap and you wo n't feel bad even if you knock it so far it gets lost . Or bats - - you do n't have to use aluminum bats ; locally made wooden ones are also fine .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
The stone flagpole stand erected in the front courtyard to symbolize the family 's glory has , jammed in amongst delivery trucks , sedans , and motorcycles , long lost the position of veneration it once had . Entering the ancestral worship room , the sound of a printing machine assails the ears like thunder , and even the ancestral hall has become a temporary storage area . In the well courtyard , there is no sign of greenery , only scattered garbage .  
Mercuric fish and green oysters ! When the inhabitants of Minimata Bay ate the mercury contaminated fish their muscles wasted away , they lost their sight , and became psychologically damaged . Brain damaged and finally paralyzed , many fell unconscious and nearly 150 of them died .  
Perhaps adult fireflies , who use their light to match up with their spouse , have grown dazzled and dazed by the streets lined with lights . With potential mates lost in the glare , they live celibate lives .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
The problem of creativity in Taiwan films lies in the fact that the proletarian class is attached to Hong Kong and Hollywood films that are sensory stimulation , while elite culture is still separated by too large a gap . We have lost middle-of-the-road commercial entertainment , " argues Chiao . Ang Lee proves the potential of the middle road .  
Plants are 90 percent water , and a thriving 100-year-old tree needs to replace close to half a metric ton of water lost to evaporation every day . Without an unending supply of water , a tree will be hard pressed to grow big .  
The custom of raising havoc in the bridal chamber reaches back into the mists of Chinese history ; maybe it really is a " unique treasure of Chinese culture . " But as it has changed and evolved through countless generations , perhaps it has lost its original meaning , and even become a controversial practice which smacks of abusing the bride .  
Last year , during the school 's summer camp , there were posters all over the school proclaiming " Say No to Drugs . " From a discussion about rampant drug abuse in the United States , she delved into modern Chinese history , examining how China lost power and was humiliated after the Opium War . Using a biography of Lin Tze-hsu as supplementary educational material , she was able to capture the students ' interest .  
In an old house : It was actually just by chance that this valuable piece ever came to light : One day two years ago , 24-year-old Wu Chung-wei was driving to Hsinchuang when he got confused and lost his way . At Yenping North Road he came across a long disused and damaged railroad workers ' dormitory .  
After the R . O . C . lost its UN seat , its international position gradually became more and more shadowy , as one country after another broke off diplomatic relations , navigational rights were rescinded , the R . O . C . was forced to withdraw from international organizations , and R . O . C . passport holders faced obstacles wherever they went .  
Finding an heir in a test tube : Even though Taiwan 's in vitro fertilization technology has reached an international standard , Liu Chi-hung feels concern that little attention is paid within the country to basic research . " Everyone is only anxious to study the procedures , without researching the underlying reasons . They just understand the superficial results ; when they run into problems , they 're lost at sea . "  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
As the music began , a young lass who looked no older than 16 came onto the stage and sang . She appeared to be unfamiliar and slightly clumsy with her dance steps , and her singing often fell behind the beat . The experienced hostess demonstrated to her how to wriggle her hips , at the same time helping her out by taking up the song where the girl lost track of her place .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
But Teng Shu-ping is also painfully aware that many of these jade artifacts have been illegally dug up and sold in mainland China , and not excavated by expert archaeologists . Such practices not only damage the ancient tombs , they also cause a great deal of archeological information to be lost . Furthermore , the spiralling price of fine ancient jade has indirectly encouraged counterfeiters , so that there are many bogus pieces about .  
" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over . It 's more about redefining Peking opera and readjusting the guidelines for national cultural development , " says National Institute of the Arts teacher Wen Chiu-chu , who just completed research on " Taiwanese Peking opera . " The three military opera troupes used to be cultural products forcibly cultivated by the government . They used up quite a lot of national resources , and under excessive protection they lost their ability to be innovative and different .  
However , money is not static . It ebbs and flows like water , and if for a while it is silent or flows out of the country this does not mean that its power has been lost , all the more so since exchange rates and tariffs have become more reasonable and are unlikely to once again become a major factor depressing prices . If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
Tea by that time had already become an international commodity . The price went through constant fluctuations , so during those years some people made money , and some people lost money . In this way , the stable system of agricultural production and commerce in previous times , as well as the systems of wholesale distribution and management , were all destroyed .  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
Director of the Chunghwa Telecom union Chang Hsu-chung said : " We have become too used to being the dominant player in the market . The result of slack internal management , laziness and shirking in state-owned enterprises is that employees have become like a frog in warm water waiting to be slowly boiled . Because we are too used to a cosy , comfortable life we have lost our vitality . "  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
Haucha elder Kuo Chin-ting says that in the past , people usually avoided swamps , which were overgrown with plants and easy to get lost in . Over time , by oral tradition ( the equivalent of tribal law ) , these became taboo areas .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
Other possible symptoms include feelings of alienation , emotional withdrawal and a loss of interest in life . Some victims become hypersensitive , anxious , insomniac , unable to focus their attention and subject to memory lapses . Those who have lost a loved one or who themselves survived a disaster are particularly prone to feeling guilty about their own survival when others died .  
Soldiers who had been exposed to the horrors of trench warfare , the constant threat of death , who had seen their brothers-in-arms wounded and killed while they themselves were unable to do anything about it , would shout and cry hysterically , or become suddenly rigid . Their personalities changed ; they became silent and unresponsive . Some even lost their memories or their senses .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead . Although a museum was established , as a consequence it lost its potential local commemorative significance .  
In the end Frank Hsieh won by a tiny margin of just over 4,000 votes . Political observer and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Chen Mau-hsiung has argued that Wu Den-yih originally held the upper hand in the election , but lost women 's votes as a result of the tape-recording affair . In contrast , the later video merely compounded the dissatisfaction of the electorate , contributing to the DPP gaining control in southern Taiwan .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
Hsiao Lin says that as soon as she removed her clothes , her friend Rongrong got all stone-faced , as if given a frightful scare . Previously , in women 's club meetings at school she was always full of righteous opinion on body issues , demonstrating far-left thinking , and prior to the photo shoot they had engaged in quite a bit of discussion and joked around a lot . So it came as a surprise when Rongrong " lost her wits " when it came down to real business .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
Ban Zhao herself was a thoroughly upper-class woman . Her father and older brother were both famous historians . Although she lost her husband at an early age and thus experienced little of marital bliss , she no doubt found considerable fulfillment in her very active life as a writer . She finished the writing of Ba Biao and Tianwen Zhi , both of which had been started by her father and continued by her brother .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color . As a result of these efforts , however , he later developed cataracts and lost his sight .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
This accounts for the lustrous , vibrant quality of the tricolor glazed pottery of the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , though the fact that tricolor pottery was fired at less than 1000 _ C meant it was prone to break . Also , the finished works differed widely from each other depending on the quality of the clay , the type of glaze , the temperature and even the kind of chimney in the kiln . At higher temperatures , for example , the glaze lost its fluidity .  
Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help . The main reason is that children who lost both parents received NT $ 2 million in death benefit , whereas most old people whose children died received no benefit since their children were already married .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
Music also interferes with the contemplative process of liberating oneself from worldly concerns , and even Mahakasyapa , who always accompanied the Buddha , was unable to calm down when preaching to the lovely sound of a zither-while the other 500 divine beings present simply lost their heads and started dancing . When former music students take monastic vows they renounce forever their beloved pianos and violins , because everything makes way for the overriding priority of breaking the cycle of rebirth .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
His son , who is in senior high school , once reached 90 kilos in weight , and was depressed and constantly lethargic . A friend introduced Huang junior to replacement-meal " shakes , " and in a month he lost 12 kilos . After this , Huang Pin-hung himself began drinking the liquid meals , accompanied by a regime of light , mildly spiced foods and jogging , and he too reduced his weight from 76 to 66 kilos .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
But those workers who have lost their jobs are quite a different group from the workers in such urgent demand in industry . Michael Hsiao pointed out that those who are out of work have lost their jobs because changes in Taiwan 's industrial structure have made their skills obsolete . Continuing the restructuring of local industry is not going to create jobs for this group . Hsiao argued that the government should instead address the unemployment problem through social assistance measures , and the shortage of workers in key industries through economic policy .  
Stanley Yen complained that once the tourism industry finally got a school established to train professional chefs , the structure of Taiwan 's tertiary education system changed and many technical junior colleges were redesignated as four-year colleges . As a result , the most talented graduates of the cooking school ended up teaching rather than working in food services , and Taiwan lost its opportunity to produce international-caliber chefs .  
Thereafter Taiwan 's economy was transformed from relying mainly on agriculture to one dominated by light industry , and forestry lost its former importance . Forestry policy was changed from maximizing production to cutting of timber only on small areas in a planned way .  
Under the WTO regime , Japan again lost in arbitration over complaints brought by foreign countries . WTO rulings are more enforceable , so within 15 months of the ruling Japan raised taxes on sake and somewhat lowered tariffs on imports of hard liquor . Nonetheless , by hemming and hawing , Japan put off raising taxes on sake for more than a decade .  
While Lai was in Japan he pored over the ancient Records of Artisanry , pondering and experimenting continuously in an effort to resurrect the long lost technique . But for years he was frustrated . Then , serendipity struck in 1986 . While making a wood base , he mixed the thinner left over from the day before into his lacquer .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
The odd thing is that precisely because Taiwan 's public health system was so successful in the past-because the " enemy " had been defeated in every battle-people became inattentive to public health . As time went on , frontline public health personnel neglected their training and lost completely their fighting edge .  
The Nationalist government 's Taiwan policy at that time was to reverse the Japanization of the island , and shortly after the end of the war it banned the use of Japanese . Authors who wrote in Japanese lost their medium , and the Taiwanese people , most of whom were as yet unfamiliar with Mandarin , became effectively illiterate . In short , the policy wrought cultural havoc on Taiwanese society .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
At the end of November , the Legislative Yuan was buzzing as legislators rushed to get key bills affecting the nation 's future and the economy passed . Legislative assistants ( LAs ) , responsible for helping their respective party caucuses negotiate the content of legislation and then mobilize legislators to vote on it , lost track of time and many could be found wandering around enveloped in a haze of exhaustion .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory . In recent years he has taken a succession of odd jobs to make ends meet . Currently he is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the children . Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
Of the 34 lighthouses Taiwan has built on its coasts and nearby islands , Huang Ching-jung has been a keeper for 27 , more than any other person in the country . Forty-five of the 75 years of his life have been spent among the lighthouses . Although he has been retired for ten years , Huang has still not lost his feeling for the lighthouses . He uses discarded pipes to make models of the lighthouses that he puts in his home , and in many dreams late at night he is still connected to the lighthouses .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
As the old Chinese saying goes , " weather has unexpected twists ; fortunes can turn in a day . " Just one example : A man living in Taipei City 's Anping Borough who supported his family by cleaning building exteriors lost his footing in January and fell to his death , leaving behind a disabled wife and three young children . There was n't even enough money for the funeral , and the fatherless family suddenly found itself in the direst of straits .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
The most exciting game was that against Japan , which went into extra innings , with Chinese Taipei being clipped by only a single run . Head coach Hsu Sheng-ming said that although the team lost , no one had even expected it to give Japan much of a fight , so their efforts both at the plate and in the field were very admirable . Star pitcher Tsao Chin-hui threw until his hand blistered and began bleeding , giving an idea of the determination shown by the whole squad .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
There used to be a craftswoman in Chiayi who specialized in making these fans . When she died about 20 years ago the craft was lost , but demand for the fans has grown along with the numbers of the troupes performing . Hence , Chen studied how to make them , and after 20 years of intense research has become the undisputed leading maker of these fans .  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
It may have been because she was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery , but Fu Chieh left her knapsack on a mountain top . She only noticed that she 'd lost it when we planned to go the free market . We rushed back to the mountain to look for the knapsack , and came across a good-hearted person who had found it and who returned it to Fu Chieh . This was one of several pleasant surprises during this trip .  
Income adjusted for changes in national wealth is defined as national income minus the interest cost of investments needed to replace capital assets damaged or lost as a result of natural or man-made disasters .  
The procedure for valuing the movable and immovable property lost by refugees and persons subjected to forced resettlement , assessing material losses and paying compensation shall be determined jointly by the Parties concerned .  
Mr . Joudeh informed the Special Committee how he had lost his entire crop and stopped farming as a result of the prolonged curfews imposed in the occupied territories after the Gulf War :  
After the 1980s , which had been a lost decade for development , trends for the 1990s were not very encouraging : growing instability , uneven development , slow economic recovery and rising unemployment in the industrialized countries .  
This Organization was brought into being by the vision , the hope and the determination of men and women who experienced at first hand the lethal dangers of nationalism , economic depression , lost freedom and devastating war men and women who realized the need to create mechanisms that would allow States to embark upon a collective effort in dealing with a wide range of complex international issues .
