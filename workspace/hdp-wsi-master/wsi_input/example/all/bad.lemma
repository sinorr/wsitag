The work on various fronts and of various departments , which is led by our party , especially that of the political and legal affairs departments , should persistently serve the people heart and soul and should focus on tackling problems which have aroused strong resentment among the people and masses , such as unfair trials , lack of forceful enforcement , bad images , and so on .

Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
They tried 290 cases of selling food below sanitary standards or poisonous harmful food , products below safety standards , counterfeit medicine , as well as counterfeit and bad quality agricultural chemicals , animal medicine , chemical fertilizers , and seeds , an increase of 24 percent over the previous year , involving the punishment of 267 criminals .  
If other countries followed US hegemonist logic and bad example , and , as authorized by their parliaments , made irresponsible remarks and unwarranted charges concerning the internal affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries , what normal international order could there be , and would the world not be in total chaos !  
One of major policies adopted at the meeting is to , in combination with the efforts of state-owned banks to handle their bad assets with concentrated efforts , introduce the practice of changing debt to equity by means of financial assets management companies and resolve the problem of an unduly high ratio of liabilities in a number of key state enterprises which have marketable products and enjoy sound development prospects , but have nevertheless landed in difficulty because of their unduly high ratio of liabilities .  
Drawing on the successful experiences of foreign countries , China has successively set up the four financial asset management companies of Xinda , Dongfang , Changcheng , and Huarong since last year .  By far , these companies have respectively purchased , operated , and handled the bad assets of the China Construction Bank , the Bank of China , the Agricultural Bank of China , and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China . This marks the formal start of the practice of changing debt into equity in the country .  
The United States led NATO to conduct military intervention in the ethnic dispute inside the FRY and to openly support the " Kosovo Liberation Army , " a terrorist and splittist organization .  This created a bad precedent in supporting national splittism and terrorist activities in the domain of international relations .  The national splittist forces in some countries and international terrorists saw their chance and started provoking and making trouble .  
Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .  Hence , the changes in their political attitude and ideological state are hard to be controlled .  
Third , in April 1999 , the state decided to establish Xinda Assets Management Company , and in October the same year , three more assets management companies , Huarong , Changcheng , and Dongfang , were established .  They took over a considerable portion of bad assets formed by policy-related loans and those formed during the track-changing period so that the capital burdens of bad assets , which the state-owned commercial banks should write off or prepare to write off , have been lessened .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
They aim for the target of accomplishing combat task requirements without going through real battle training and without replenishing personnel and equipment .  Through reform of flight training , this unit has realized new breakthroughs in combat strength in the following five areas .  In the area of basic flight skill training , flying has been evolved from normal conditions to flying under bad weather conditions or under other extreme conditions .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
Fourth , optimize the organizational structure of the enterprises , appropriately merging enterprises in the same industries through the market mechanism which maintain the good and eliminate the bad and through macroeconomic regulation , ensure full competition among enterprises , form a pattern dominated by large enterprises and suited to the coordinated development of enterprises of all sizes .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
When the bad news that Wang Wei had laid down his life for the country was confirmed , " one-billion people were tearful and the sea level reportedly rose three feet . "  No one was not grievous over the loss of such a heroic fighter .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .  A severe punishment is absolutely necessary .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
Dai Xianglong pointed out that , after the Asian financial crisis of 1997 , the various countries of Asia learned a lesson , adopting realistic and feasible adjustment measures , intensifying their underlying readjustments and financial reorganization efforts , disposing of bad assets , lowering enterprise debt-equity ratios , and promoting economic recovery and growth , so financial operations have been basically stable .  
For the past year , Taiwan 's politics and economy have been in a state of constant chaos , the economic situation has gone from bad to worse , the unemployment rate has climbed steadily , the public 's index of suffering has continuously gone up , cross-strait relations have fallen behind as a result of their inability to advance , and the Taiwan public has already completely lost hope for the new government .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
They began another consecutive , intensified , night flight training exercise under bad weather conditions .  The training was based on the following scenario : They experienced defeats before .  They want to enhance their continuous fighting capability by improving their almost-real combat training .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
They are unwilling to delve into reality , to get down and mix with the masses , and to conduct difficult and detailed investigative research .  Even if they do try this , it is just a gourd dropping into a well : it seems to sink , but then it just floats on the surface .  These organizations report good news , but not anything that might be worrying , or they report a lot of good news and little that is bad .  
Western countries such as the United States have set a bad precedent in international law by playing with double political and legal standards and pushing into the dock the leaders of countries whom they regard as a nail in the eye , and this is bound to be condemned by the international community .  
For instance , gratifying changes have emerged in the problem of commercial banks ' bad debts , which had been regarded as a " time bomb " by many financial experts at home and abroad : The central bank has announced that the rate of bad debts of state-owned commercial banks has started to fall since the fourth quarter of last year , and on average it dropped by 2.1 percentage points during the first six months of this year .  
In the last few years , as China 's economy has developed rapidly , bad assets , extending loans in violation of established regulations , financial fraud , losses of state-owned assets , and other problems related to Chinese banks , insurance companies , and other financial institutions have cropped up one after another , seriously compromising healthy development of China 's financial industry and economy and becoming an economic tumor in the country .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market . 
The exceptionally large smuggling case recently cracked in Xiamen is among the worst smuggling cases ever handled ever since the founding of New China , for it involved an immense amount of money , showed complicated details , did severe harm to society , and left extremely bad impressions ; and the problems exposed in the case have proved a shock to the public .  
Now , although the profits of those big companies that prop up the US economy have declined , their overall performance is not bad and they remain very competitive internationally .  The potential for higher labor productivity driven by technological revolution will not be reversed .  This is why the performance of the " Dow Jones index , " dominated by traditional industries , betters that of the " Nasdaq index . "  
As for topic on banking , it will include the positioning of policy-related banks , the consolidation of rural credit cooperatives , how to digest bad debts by asset management companies , market-oriented interest rates , foreign exchange control , further resolving contradictions in the current financial operation , and continuing to solve problems which remain unsolved .

Inventories have dropped , enterprises ' economic results have improved , growth of the new - and high-technology and information industry has accelerated , the drop in prices has slowed down , and social consumption has increased steadily .  
Taking Malaysia as an example , from the latter half of 1998 , it lowered interest rates , canceled many restrictions on use of loans , relaxed the deadlines for bad debts , increased appropriations for public expenses , invested in the construction of infrastructure facilities , and implemented a controllable unbalanced budget plan , with deficits accounting for 6 percent of the GDP .  
All East Asian countries paid attention to drawing lessons from the financial crisis and intensified financial reform .  On the one hand , the financial order was straightened out .  Some ailing banks were forced to close down , merge with others , and accept others ' management , so that the bad credit of banks was resolutely resolved .

With the " backing " of the huge defense budget , the extremely expansive and aggressive US military and foreign policy has worsened the international atmosphere and disrupted international order , and goes against the tide of the times of world peace and development ; it is " bad tidings " as mankind enters the new century .  
These devious fallacies of fundamental knowledge " preached by Li Hongzhi have taken advantage of the bad phenomenon of people 's hatred for society and their pursuit of livelihood and morality in the good expectations and proper ideological trends of truthfulness , benevolence , and forbearance .  They have taken advantage of the indiscriminate mentality and blind faith of some people in traditional thought culture .  
His aim and sinister ambition was to portray himself as a saint protecting the democracy and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and to imply that the government of the Chinese mainland and the CPC , which oppose his criminal behavior , are an autocratic devil opposed to democracy and human rights , in a bid to stir up bad feeling between the Taiwan compatriots and the mainland of the motherland and pin on it the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan strait and for a possible war .  
Through eliminating bad assets and instilling fine assets , some listed companies running in the red or those whose achievements are just ordinary have seen a thoroughgoing change and adopted a new outlook .  Their unpopular stocks , which were originally not in investors ' favor , or their " garbage stocks , " have become hot stocks pursued by the market and have entered the rank of high-price stocks enjoying good sales .  
So , it is necessary to make evaluation , investigation of responsibility , and division of work into a coordinate process .  At present , prominent attention should be paid to major economic losses , serious accidents , and serious incidents cropping up due to leading cadres ' failure in improving party style and administrative honesty .  We should find out who is to blame for long-lasting serious unhealthy trends and investigate leading cadres ' spouses and children who abuse leading cadres ' functions and influential power to obtain unlawful benefits and to create bad influence .  
Some law experts note that because LC fraud involves many middle links , and units and personnel at home and overseas that take part in the fraud are entitled to service charges illegally .  They say that fraud carried out in collusion by lawless elements at home and abroad , while preventing banks from collecting the loans they have extended and increasing their bad debts by geometric progression , is often accompanied by corruption , bribery , and other forms of lawlessness .  Thus its danger to society is even more penetrating and extensive than ordinary crimes .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
His action seriously tarnished the clean and honest image of government personnel , damaged the purity of public servants in conducting official duties , seriously discredited the fine reputation of state functionaries , seriously violated the normal working order of government institutions , and created extremely bad influence in society .  The nature of his crimes is extremely serious and should be harshly dealt with in accordance with the law .  
During his period in office in Guangxi , as a high-ranking cadre , he used the advantages afforded by his powers to pursue private interests and illegally received huge amounts of money and material from others ; the case was particularly bad and seriously infringed on the honesty of state work personnel 's duties , and ruined the reputation of the party and government ; he is a typical corrupt element .  
The CCDI standing committee is of the opinion that Comrade Xu Penghang , as a party member and leading cadre , exploited his position to help Kangsai Company with its floatation and supported and took part in his family 's purchase of employee shares to make a huge profit .  His behavior has seriously undermined the clean and honest behavior expected of government officials while performing their functions , caused very bad political damage , and constituted a serious violation of discipline .  
A financial management company was established to purchase bad commercial bank loans which were nationally funded , the central bank 's capital filled out , branch structure reduced and consolidated , internal management strengthened , and the international assessment standard raised .  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .  
We must further set straight the guiding ideology of our work , vigorously improve leadership style , advocate less talk and more action , work earnestly and in a down-to-earth manner , seek truths and be pragmatic , and lay stress on effectiveness .  We must firmly oppose and overcome such formalism and bureaucratism as showy work style , reporting good news and suppressing the bad , and doing superficial work , and truly ensure various tasks are properly carried out .  
In addition , a report published by a foreign firm Solomen Meibang [ name as transliterated ] , Taiwan 's banks currently have potential bad debts totaling NT $ 1.7 trillion to NT $ 2 trillion .  More enterprises are expected to default on their loans in the next six months , which would lead to bankruptcy of some peripheral financial institutions .  
Only as a result of extricating large - and medium-sized state-owned enterprises carrying excessive debt and bogged down in difficulties from these difficulties , integrating reforms for state-owned commercial banks that concentrate on disposal of bad assets , and the State adopting resolute measures for transforming the banks ' partial creditor 's rights in these enterprises into the shareholder 's rights of financial asset management companies will some products be enabled to have a market , prospect for development , advanced technology , a good operational foundation , and a strong leadership team .  
Major and serious cases that cause serious harms and bad influence and which the people show strong reactions should be handled by designated departments , the system of responsibility for cracking down on cases should be implemented , and competent people should be organized to crack cases quickly .  
At the same time , Taiwan 's financial authorities were forced to admit that the rate of Taiwan banks ' overdue loans has already reached 8 percent and more , and bad loans have reached more than $ 1.2 trillion NTD ; whether or not a large-scale or " local style " financial upheaval will explode in Taiwan has become a hot topic in international economic circles .  
Leading cadres who are derelict of their duties shall be held accountable if such dereliction leads to major and important cases that create very bad influence .  Relevant leading cadres will also be held responsible if they violate relevant policies and stipulations governing selection and appointment of leading cadres or if they are found to have been negligent about selection and appointment of leading cadres .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
The economists held that the current financial system in our country can not meet the requirements of getting accession into the World Trade Organization . In particular , the state-owned commercial banks will be facing sterner challenges , and the issue of bad assets will become more serious .  It is necessary to explore an effective and feasible solution .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
The dialogue on the financial crisis covered several topics , which included the strengthening of financial and legal systems , recapitalising banks affected by bad debts , the use of savings to build domestic bond and securities markets and ways to guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil .  
August was an opportune time : turnover in the stock market had shrunk to about a third of its normal level ; there was bad news as the Government announced that first-quarter GDP growth had been negative ; and rumours were flying around predicting the devaluation of the Renminbi and the severing of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar .  
An eminent senior judge who has recently retired commented as follows : " . . . although everybody trumpets the common law system , we all know it is not a perfect system by any means and we are always open to suggestions from other systems . . .  It may well be that in the long term we see , because the common law is so flexible , that good things are taken on board and bad things are rejected .  
To do so would set a very bad precedent by giving a special group preferential treatment , contrary to the cardinal principle that all men ( and women ) are equal before the law .  
In this connection , will the Government provide a breakdown , by industry and participating bank , of the bad debt ratios of the loan cases approved under the Scheme , the total amount of loans involved in these cases and , of the enterprises with bad debts , the respective numbers of the operating and the defunct ones ?  
The Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises set up by the Government in 1998 has stopped accepting new loan applications since April 2000 .  Nevertheless , the credit guarantees approved prior to that date will not be fully discharged until May 2003 .  As such , we are unable to tell at this stage whether the ultimate bad debt ratio will indeed reach 15 per cent as cited by Dr Hon Lui Ming-wah .  
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis .

The adults in general did not perceive the need for regular dental check-ups .  Most of them had experienced various oral health problems such as bad breath , bleeding gums , sensitivity to hot and cold , and pain that disturbed sleeping .  
Since every day is like walking on pins and needles , some people are superstitious about little things such as being careful so as not to place the sheet music upside down , not sitting on the sheet music , not wearing purple clothing , not passing under the staircase , and spitting three times before wearing new clothes . By doing so it 's said that you can avoid bringing bad luck upon yourself .  
The most modern pedagogical tool they had at the time was a gramophone with a wooden needle that played sound disks telling " very bad stories in an unclear voice . " The teaching methodologies of his generation were a far cry from today 's .  
And somewhere out there four " adolescent young men " are creeping up stealthily for the attack . Even though they are walking on tiptoe and muffling their breath , I feel four pairs of eyes watching me from behind , gleaming eyes , the same as those of all bad boys up to no good , waiting for their chance to stand out in the light , put on a hypocritical smile , and call me father-in-law .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
That is to say , the younger those who have been arrested and imprisoned are at the first offense , the more likely is the possibility they will be repeat or serious offenders later . This is because on the inside not only are they able to learn even more " specialized " criminal techniques , after they get out , because they have been " labelled " as bad guys , it is difficult to go straight .  
A study of the behavioral problems of gifted children in elementary schools in Taipei found that 50 percent of them had had psychological difficulties such as " I 'd like to do a lot of things but I do n't have the courage , " " I 'm afraid of being put in a poor class in middle school " and " I have a lot of bad habits . "  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
Some child abuse is brought on by bad behavior , which is reinforced by improper methods of child-rearing , creating a vicious cycle , " Ho Su-chiu says . The responsibilities of foster parents in a case like that is n't limited to caring for the child 's daily needs . They also have to correct the child deviant behavior , so they need to employ extra skill and energy .  
Poor grades are bad enough - - what they 're even more worried about is that their darling little child , having fallen in with a " mixed crowd " back in the slow learner class , will be led astray on a short path to nowhere : no higher schooling , no steady employment and a life of idleness , dillydallying and shiftlessness . . . .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
For example , one could use those nearly indestructible rubber baseballs - - they 're very cheap and you wo n't feel bad even if you knock it so far it gets lost . Or bats - - you do n't have to use aluminum bats ; locally made wooden ones are also fine .  
Especially in 1981 , just three years after the United States broke off diplomatic relations , and with a sensitive atmosphere still lingering two years after the riots of the Kao-hsiung Incident . Although her parents had never filled her with any kind of political consciousness , Hsin Chi-ming had still , from a young age , got a fuzzy stereotyped idea that anyone who had anything to do with the 228 Incident was a thoroughly bad person , so you can imagine how she panicked .  
The owner of one old wooden house , no longer willing to put up with rotting sills and doorposts , had his home rebuilt ; but although he no longer used wood as a material , he retained the original upper halves of the walls , along with the lion 's -head panel over the doorway , achieving not a bad compromise in keeping alive the traditional folk customs and beliefs .  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
It 's just too bad that 12 years ago when the entire village moved down to the plains , their old village was left abandoned , its streets and gardens weed choked and its stone walls toppled .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
It 's just too bad that Du Fu did n't mention the dogs running around at the feet of the beautiful women . These canine companions might have been wearing red silk handkerchiefs or their entire bodies might even have been dyed the same color as their mistresses ' clothes .  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
It might be a standard reaction to suspect you are dealing with a bad guy . But if you suspect the majority of people might harm you , then it 's a sign of having mental problems . ( For example , many people constantly dwell on such ideas as " society is unforgiving , " or " people 's hearts are crooked and mean " and use this as an excuse to force their kids to struggle hard . )  
The Chinese have always sought stability and order , and they make a big deal about how their residences and tombs are oriented . " With a dragon on the left and tiger on the right to ward off bad luck and with a rose finch and a black soldier to regulate the Yin and Yang , " it was believed , " children and grandchildren will surround you and your ancestors will be happy and prosperous . "  
This , he says , deeply embarrassed Luo and was the cause of the bad blood between them . These explanations caused Luo , who really was out of the country , to become the prime suspect . Upon his return , Luo immediately launched a counter-offensive , charging that the entire kidnapping was just a stunt cooked up by Liao himself , and that the note was written with the intent of casting suspicion on Luo .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
Ending class struggle gave people a breathing spell . And , in a decisive fashion , Deng removed the many labels - " landlord , " " bourgeois , " " counter-revolutionary , " " bad element , " " rightist , " and so on-from the many people erroneously branded in the many political movements of the past .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
For instance , in summer the lesser coucal , which can often be seen in Taiwan , is brownish black all over its body , but its wings are chest-nut red , as if it were wearing a brightly colored shawl . Bird painter Ho Hua-jen describes it as having " chestnut wings with a metallic sheen . " This cuckoo , at least , is not so bad looking after all .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
The post-martial-law atmosphere has formed the Taiwan alternative music we see today . Within the music industry system , Magic Stone Records , which used to be an alternative label , has chosen a path between underground and commercial record company operation . They have chosen the good and discarded the bad in both business modes and have carved out an alternative business path which is one of the phenomena worthy of note accompanying this wave .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .  
These would then be displayed in front of the home to ward off bad fortune and evil spirits . The people of ancient Japan would also gather medicinal herbs to prevent illness . These customs remain alive today . The Japanese have a May 5th custom of eating kashiwamochi ( rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves ) and soaking in a hot tub or hot spring filled with iris leaves .  
Increasingly complex parent-child rela-tions , a rising divorce rate , and seemingly insoluble marital problems are causing people to feel more and more that " the family is sick . " That 's bad enough , but the succession of child abuse , domestic violence , incest , and other cases which have been appearing in the news one after another are causing people to fear that " the family may be harmful ! "  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
A particularly testing time was the Asian financial crisis , starting in July 1997 , when the economy stumbled and the stock market index collapsed to 5000 points . The government responded by immediately cutting corporate taxes in the financial sector . This helped the industry to overcome bad debts , triggered a rebound on the stock market , and enabled the banking sector to provide relief for businesses , thus enabling Taiwan to ride out the worst of the storm .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
When he went to language school in the US , he was struck by fits of depression with no apparent cause . It got so bad he had to take Prozac to get by , and , when walking by the lake , even had thoughts of jumping in and ending it all . Later his parents sent him a calligraphic amulet , which he attached to his door , and the inexplicable blue mood finally lifted .  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
When Wang Yeh circulated through the narrow lanes and alleyways of the town , doors were sealed and lights were extinguished in all houses along the route . The only illumination came from the lanterns of the inspection party . The songcaoren ritual for expelling evil , conducted just before the end of the inspection tour , was even more fearsome . Many legends surround bad things that happened to people who did n't get out of the way in time and were subject to the same terrifying forces that were called up to deal with demons .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
Because there is no history of breast cancer in her family , after the illness she took a good look at herself , and felt that the problem must be rooted in her bad daily habits . When filming , she would eat four boxed lunches-typically fried chicken or pork chops-every day . These , she realized , probably were n't doing her any good . Nor , she figured , were the long hours she works while in production .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
These books are regarded as books " by bad kids , for bad kids . " There are numerous young writers on the mainland now attempting to gain a name for themselves by following Han Han 's model . Han himself is rich and famous . Like Taiwan singing idol Lin Chih-ying , Han is fond of racing expensive cars .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .

The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .  This requires thinking in terms of grand strategies and great enterprises , with emphasis on realistic visions .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .

In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The administrative component of UNMOT would be strengthened to support the larger Mission , as would its communications , road and air transport and other facilities , bearing in mind the mountainous terrain and the bad state of repair of the roads , many of which are cut off as a result of damage or will be impassable for several months in winter .

We hope that we have all learned the lessons from events which have so seriously affected the country in human , material , psychological and other terms , and that we understand that war will always be a bad master and the worst choice .

This marks the formal start of the practice of changing debt into equity in the country .  
The United States led NATO to conduct military intervention in the ethnic dispute inside the FRY and to openly support the " Kosovo Liberation Army , " a terrorist and splittist organization .

Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .

People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .

If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .

They are unwilling to delve into reality , to get down and mix with the masses , and to conduct difficult and detailed investigative research .

Western countries such as the United States have set a bad precedent in international law by playing with double political and legal standards and pushing into the dock the leaders of countries whom they regard as a nail in the eye , and this is bound to be condemned by the international community .

The exceptionally large smuggling case recently cracked in Xiamen is among the worst smuggling cases ever handled ever since the founding of New China , for it involved an immense amount of money , showed complicated details , did severe harm to society , and left extremely bad impressions ; and the problems exposed in the case have proved a shock to the public .  
Now , although the profits of those big companies that prop up the US economy have declined , their overall performance is not bad and they remain very competitive internationally .

We should find out who is to blame for long-lasting serious unhealthy trends and investigate leading cadres ' spouses and children who abuse leading cadres ' functions and influential power to obtain unlawful benefits and to create bad influence .  
Some law experts note that because LC fraud involves many middle links , and units and personnel at home and overseas that take part in the fraud are entitled to service charges illegally .  They say that fraud carried out in collusion by lawless elements at home and abroad , while preventing banks from collecting the loans they have extended and increasing their bad debts by geometric progression , is often accompanied by corruption , bribery , and other forms of lawlessness .  Thus its danger to society is even more penetrating and extensive than ordinary crimes .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .

During his period in office in Guangxi , as a high-ranking cadre , he used the advantages afforded by his powers to pursue private interests and illegally received huge amounts of money and material from others ; the case was particularly bad and seriously infringed on the honesty of state work personnel 's duties , and ruined the reputation of the party and government ; he is a typical corrupt element .  
The CCDI standing committee is of the opinion that Comrade Xu Penghang , as a party member and leading cadre , exploited his position to help Kangsai Company with its floatation and supported and took part in his family 's purchase of employee shares to make a huge profit .  His behavior has seriously undermined the clean and honest behavior expected of government officials while performing their functions , caused very bad political damage , and constituted a serious violation of discipline .  
A financial management company was established to purchase bad commercial bank loans which were nationally funded , the central bank 's capital filled out , branch structure reduced and consolidated , internal management strengthened , and the international assessment standard raised .  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .  
We must further set straight the guiding ideology of our work , vigorously improve leadership style , advocate less talk and more action , work earnestly and in a down-to-earth manner , seek truths and be pragmatic , and lay stress on effectiveness .  We must firmly oppose and overcome such formalism and bureaucratism as showy work style , reporting good news and suppressing the bad , and doing superficial work , and truly ensure various tasks are properly carried out .  
In addition , a report published by a foreign firm Solomen Meibang [ name as transliterated ] , Taiwan 's banks currently have potential bad debts totaling NT $ 1.7 trillion to NT $ 2 trillion .  More enterprises are expected to default on their loans in the next six months , which would lead to bankruptcy of some peripheral financial institutions .  
Only as a result of extricating large - and medium-sized state-owned enterprises carrying excessive debt and bogged down in difficulties from these difficulties , integrating reforms for state-owned commercial banks that concentrate on disposal of bad assets , and the State adopting resolute measures for transforming the banks ' partial creditor 's rights in these enterprises into the shareholder 's rights of financial asset management companies will some products be enabled to have a market , prospect for development , advanced technology , a good operational foundation , and a strong leadership team .  
Major and serious cases that cause serious harms and bad influence and which the people show strong reactions should be handled by designated departments , the system of responsibility for cracking down on cases should be implemented , and competent people should be organized to crack cases quickly .  
At the same time , Taiwan 's financial authorities were forced to admit that the rate of Taiwan banks ' overdue loans has already reached 8 percent and more , and bad loans have reached more than $ 1.2 trillion NTD ; whether or not a large-scale or " local style " financial upheaval will explode in Taiwan has become a hot topic in international economic circles .  
Leading cadres who are derelict of their duties shall be held accountable if such dereliction leads to major and important cases that create very bad influence .  Relevant leading cadres will also be held responsible if they violate relevant policies and stipulations governing selection and appointment of leading cadres or if they are found to have been negligent about selection and appointment of leading cadres .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
The economists held that the current financial system in our country can not meet the requirements of getting accession into the World Trade Organization . In particular , the state-owned commercial banks will be facing sterner challenges , and the issue of bad assets will become more serious .  It is necessary to explore an effective and feasible solution .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
The dialogue on the financial crisis covered several topics , which included the strengthening of financial and legal systems , recapitalising banks affected by bad debts , the use of savings to build domestic bond and securities markets and ways to guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil .  
August was an opportune time : turnover in the stock market had shrunk to about a third of its normal level ; there was bad news as the Government announced that first-quarter GDP growth had been negative ; and rumours were flying around predicting the devaluation of the Renminbi and the severing of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar .  
An eminent senior judge who has recently retired commented as follows : " . . . although everybody trumpets the common law system , we all know it is not a perfect system by any means and we are always open to suggestions from other systems . . .  It may well be that in the long term we see , because the common law is so flexible , that good things are taken on board and bad things are rejected .  
To do so would set a very bad precedent by giving a special group preferential treatment , contrary to the cardinal principle that all men ( and women ) are equal before the law .  
In this connection , will the Government provide a breakdown , by industry and participating bank , of the bad debt ratios of the loan cases approved under the Scheme , the total amount of loans involved in these cases and , of the enterprises with bad debts , the respective numbers of the operating and the defunct ones ?  
The Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises set up by the Government in 1998 has stopped accepting new loan applications since April 2000 .  Nevertheless , the credit guarantees approved prior to that date will not be fully discharged until May 2003 .  As such , we are unable to tell at this stage whether the ultimate bad debt ratio will indeed reach 15 per cent as cited by Dr Hon Lui Ming-wah .  
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis . They were ( i ) fiscal policy in good and bad times ; ( ii ) financial systems and corporate governance ; ( iii ) exchange rate systems ; and ( iv ) potential regional economic arrangements for Asia .  
In relation to broadcasting , the television and radio Codes of Practice issued by the Broadcasting Authority require licensees to observe at all times certain basic standards in the presentation of programmes , including news broadcasts .  A licensee should not include in its programmes any material that is indecent , obscene , or of bad taste and which is not acceptable to ordinary viewers .  
The adults in general did not perceive the need for regular dental check-ups .  Most of them had experienced various oral health problems such as bad breath , bleeding gums , sensitivity to hot and cold , and pain that disturbed sleeping .  
Since every day is like walking on pins and needles , some people are superstitious about little things such as being careful so as not to place the sheet music upside down , not sitting on the sheet music , not wearing purple clothing , not passing under the staircase , and spitting three times before wearing new clothes . By doing so it 's said that you can avoid bringing bad luck upon yourself .  
The most modern pedagogical tool they had at the time was a gramophone with a wooden needle that played sound disks telling " very bad stories in an unclear voice . " The teaching methodologies of his generation were a far cry from today 's .  
And somewhere out there four " adolescent young men " are creeping up stealthily for the attack . Even though they are walking on tiptoe and muffling their breath , I feel four pairs of eyes watching me from behind , gleaming eyes , the same as those of all bad boys up to no good , waiting for their chance to stand out in the light , put on a hypocritical smile , and call me father-in-law .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
That is to say , the younger those who have been arrested and imprisoned are at the first offense , the more likely is the possibility they will be repeat or serious offenders later . This is because on the inside not only are they able to learn even more " specialized " criminal techniques , after they get out , because they have been " labelled " as bad guys , it is difficult to go straight .  
A study of the behavioral problems of gifted children in elementary schools in Taipei found that 50 percent of them had had psychological difficulties such as " I 'd like to do a lot of things but I do n't have the courage , " " I 'm afraid of being put in a poor class in middle school " and " I have a lot of bad habits . "  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
Some child abuse is brought on by bad behavior , which is reinforced by improper methods of child-rearing , creating a vicious cycle , " Ho Su-chiu says . The responsibilities of foster parents in a case like that is n't limited to caring for the child 's daily needs . They also have to correct the child deviant behavior , so they need to employ extra skill and energy .  
Poor grades are bad enough - - what they 're even more worried about is that their darling little child , having fallen in with a " mixed crowd " back in the slow learner class , will be led astray on a short path to nowhere : no higher schooling , no steady employment and a life of idleness , dillydallying and shiftlessness . . . .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
For example , one could use those nearly indestructible rubber baseballs - - they 're very cheap and you wo n't feel bad even if you knock it so far it gets lost . Or bats - - you do n't have to use aluminum bats ; locally made wooden ones are also fine .  
Especially in 1981 , just three years after the United States broke off diplomatic relations , and with a sensitive atmosphere still lingering two years after the riots of the Kao-hsiung Incident . Although her parents had never filled her with any kind of political consciousness , Hsin Chi-ming had still , from a young age , got a fuzzy stereotyped idea that anyone who had anything to do with the 228 Incident was a thoroughly bad person , so you can imagine how she panicked .  
The owner of one old wooden house , no longer willing to put up with rotting sills and doorposts , had his home rebuilt ; but although he no longer used wood as a material , he retained the original upper halves of the walls , along with the lion 's -head panel over the doorway , achieving not a bad compromise in keeping alive the traditional folk customs and beliefs .  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
It 's just too bad that 12 years ago when the entire village moved down to the plains , their old village was left abandoned , its streets and gardens weed choked and its stone walls toppled .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
It 's just too bad that Du Fu did n't mention the dogs running around at the feet of the beautiful women . These canine companions might have been wearing red silk handkerchiefs or their entire bodies might even have been dyed the same color as their mistresses ' clothes .  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
It might be a standard reaction to suspect you are dealing with a bad guy . But if you suspect the majority of people might harm you , then it 's a sign of having mental problems . ( For example , many people constantly dwell on such ideas as " society is unforgiving , " or " people 's hearts are crooked and mean " and use this as an excuse to force their kids to struggle hard . )  
The Chinese have always sought stability and order , and they make a big deal about how their residences and tombs are oriented . " With a dragon on the left and tiger on the right to ward off bad luck and with a rose finch and a black soldier to regulate the Yin and Yang , " it was believed , " children and grandchildren will surround you and your ancestors will be happy and prosperous . "  
This , he says , deeply embarrassed Luo and was the cause of the bad blood between them . These explanations caused Luo , who really was out of the country , to become the prime suspect . Upon his return , Luo immediately launched a counter-offensive , charging that the entire kidnapping was just a stunt cooked up by Liao himself , and that the note was written with the intent of casting suspicion on Luo .  
Grass huts offer people numerous advantages-they are convenient , flexible , simple , and can be made entirely from materials readily at hand . Li Juei-tsung , an associate professor of architecture and environmental design at the Chung-Hua Polytechnic Institute , suggests , " Thatched houses are the single greatest expression of the culture of ordinary people , and they are one of the great creative products of man and nature . It 's too bad they have been ignored in architectural history . "  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
Ending class struggle gave people a breathing spell . And , in a decisive fashion , Deng removed the many labels - " landlord , " " bourgeois , " " counter-revolutionary , " " bad element , " " rightist , " and so on-from the many people erroneously branded in the many political movements of the past .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
For instance , in summer the lesser coucal , which can often be seen in Taiwan , is brownish black all over its body , but its wings are chest-nut red , as if it were wearing a brightly colored shawl . Bird painter Ho Hua-jen describes it as having " chestnut wings with a metallic sheen . " This cuckoo , at least , is not so bad looking after all .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
The post-martial-law atmosphere has formed the Taiwan alternative music we see today . Within the music industry system , Magic Stone Records , which used to be an alternative label , has chosen a path between underground and commercial record company operation . They have chosen the good and discarded the bad in both business modes and have carved out an alternative business path which is one of the phenomena worthy of note accompanying this wave .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .  
These would then be displayed in front of the home to ward off bad fortune and evil spirits . The people of ancient Japan would also gather medicinal herbs to prevent illness . These customs remain alive today . The Japanese have a May 5th custom of eating kashiwamochi ( rice cakes filled with sweet bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves ) and soaking in a hot tub or hot spring filled with iris leaves .  
Increasingly complex parent-child rela-tions , a rising divorce rate , and seemingly insoluble marital problems are causing people to feel more and more that " the family is sick . " That 's bad enough , but the succession of child abuse , domestic violence , incest , and other cases which have been appearing in the news one after another are causing people to fear that " the family may be harmful ! "  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
A particularly testing time was the Asian financial crisis , starting in July 1997 , when the economy stumbled and the stock market index collapsed to 5000 points . The government responded by immediately cutting corporate taxes in the financial sector . This helped the industry to overcome bad debts , triggered a rebound on the stock market , and enabled the banking sector to provide relief for businesses , thus enabling Taiwan to ride out the worst of the storm .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
When he went to language school in the US , he was struck by fits of depression with no apparent cause . It got so bad he had to take Prozac to get by , and , when walking by the lake , even had thoughts of jumping in and ending it all . Later his parents sent him a calligraphic amulet , which he attached to his door , and the inexplicable blue mood finally lifted .  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
When Wang Yeh circulated through the narrow lanes and alleyways of the town , doors were sealed and lights were extinguished in all houses along the route . The only illumination came from the lanterns of the inspection party . The songcaoren ritual for expelling evil , conducted just before the end of the inspection tour , was even more fearsome . Many legends surround bad things that happened to people who did n't get out of the way in time and were subject to the same terrifying forces that were called up to deal with demons .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
Because there is no history of breast cancer in her family , after the illness she took a good look at herself , and felt that the problem must be rooted in her bad daily habits . When filming , she would eat four boxed lunches-typically fried chicken or pork chops-every day . These , she realized , probably were n't doing her any good . Nor , she figured , were the long hours she works while in production .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
These books are regarded as books " by bad kids , for bad kids . " There are numerous young writers on the mainland now attempting to gain a name for themselves by following Han Han 's model . Han himself is rich and famous . Like Taiwan singing idol Lin Chih-ying , Han is fond of racing expensive cars .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
According to the second meaning , under international law , the State was a more abstract legal entity comprising a territory , a population and institutions ; in legal terms it was neither good nor bad , just nor unjust , innocent nor guilty .  
The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .  This requires thinking in terms of grand strategies and great enterprises , with emphasis on realistic visions .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
Its strategy for promoting universal access to basic social services is threefold : ( a ) direct support to service delivery ; ( b ) capacity - building and social mobilization ; and ( c ) advocacy .  UNICEF emphasizes the need to sustain investment in children in good times and in bad , and in times of fiscal restraint and economic liberalization .  
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The administrative component of UNMOT would be strengthened to support the larger Mission , as would its communications , road and air transport and other facilities , bearing in mind the mountainous terrain and the bad state of repair of the roads , many of which are cut off as a result of damage or will be impassable for several months in winter .  
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
at the national level , there are cases of discrimination against unmarried female pupils and teachers who , because of pregnancy , are expelled from private religious schools or , exceptionally , from State educational institutions on the ground that they may have a bad influence on other pupils .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
We hope that we have all learned the lessons from events which have so seriously affected the country in human , material , psychological and other terms , and that we understand that war will always be a bad master and the worst choice .  
Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;
