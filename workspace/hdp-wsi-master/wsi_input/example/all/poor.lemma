It marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and North and South , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order . 
During the UN Trade Development Council meeting , representatives of the international organizations and developing nations strongly called for reforming the current international rules and regulations , establishing a just and reasonable international political and economic order , and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor .  At the meeting , Michel Camdessus , managing director of the IMF , urged the rich countries to embrace the poor ones and jointly built a new era of cooperation .  
It is hoped that the declaration and program of action adopted at the meeting will be implemented , that the international community will make progress in reforming the current international rules and regulations and establishing a fair and rational international order , and that contribution will be made to the coordinated development of the economy of all countries and to the narrowing of the gap between the rich and the poor .  
Xiang stated : In 1999 , the Ministry of Finance also organized forces to launch a specialized examination on how specialized funds had been managed or spent , such as funds earmarked for national bonds , funds earmarked as subsidies for key flood control projects , funds earmarked for water conservancy works , and central financial funds earmarked for helping the poor ; adopted punitive measures to deal with exposed problems in a timely fashion ; and made public through the news media a number of typical cases .  
We laid stress on investigating and supervising the use of special funds obtained from national debt , the large amount of central subsidies for flood prevention and water conservancy projects , the extra-budgetary funds of the central finance , central funds for assisting the poor areas , and funds for social security .  We investigated and handled a number of cases of violating financial and economic law , and disciplined those who were involved in such cases .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
People-owned enterprises which got rich ahead of others " thought of the sources for their wealth , " actively made contributions back to society , participated in the activities of supporting the poor , supported the Hope Project , gave donations to assist elderly people who lived alone without help , and performed positive functions in the struggle against floods and other natural disasters and providing relief for people in the disaster-stricken areas .  
Under the guidance of the party Central Committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in Guangxi have built a poor and backward Guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
He stated that " in places with deep-rooted traditional cultures , even if it is extremely poor , there is still the setting sun of the tropics and comfort from stable homes that is inspiring , but the poor in the United States do n't even have these , and they often live irregular lives in which even hope has been stripped away . "  ( See Hong Kong " Ming Pao , " 7 December 1994 . )  
Hu Changqing was a poor boy growing up in a remote hill village .  He became a high-ranking party leader but eventually fell into a deep abyss and violated law and discipline and brought disgrace and ruin upon himself .  The lesson is painful and profound .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
Since the western countries instituted capitalist market economy , pollution , unemployment , and polarization between rich and poor have occurred all the time ; hence their governments have no alternative but to undertake the functions of improving efficiency , regulating income distribution , and stimulating macroeconomic stability and growth .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
The outgoing IMF managing director , Michel Camdessus , said : We have the opportunity to avoid financial crisis and narrow the wide gap between the rich and the poor that " may possibly cause an explosion " so that economic globalization will have human nature in a greater sense .  However , the premise for so doing is that the international economic structure must be commensurate with economic globalization and economic reform plans are widely supported by the populace .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
In view of the situation in which the amphibious warfare vehicles could not move forward under water and the wheeled canons could not land because of the poor geological conditions , such as sludge , and factors , such as waves , currents , shell craters , and ditches , the regiment made use of its existing bridge of boats equipment and set up a floating landing stage , thus enabling the heavy-duty equipment to reach the beach successfully in a forced landing .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
At present , our country 's socialist modernization construction is right in a critical period .  Restructuring state-owned enterprises , helping the poor and storming heavily fortified positions , completing the " Ninth Five-Year " plan , realizing the objective of comfortably well-off , and a series of important issues in the reform and development all need to be studied and resolved .  
Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
The conclusions and requests coming out of the two meetings are diametrically opposed : The resolution of the Group of 77 Ministerial Conference called for changes to the existing irrational economic order , an appeal from the poor countries to the rich ones , while the document drawn up by the G-8 in the meeting in Okinawa involved regulations and requests by the developed countries with regard to the existing world order , and was more like orders issued by the rich countries to the poor ones .  
Among all sorts of comments , however , there is an overwhelming keynote : A crucial standard for judging the success or failure of the G-8 summit is what it has done for the developing regions , especially the poorest regions .  As the gap between poor and rich countries is widening and deepening , the G-8 is facing a grim challenge of the " digital gap " .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed up the global strategic issues into four characters , " east , west , south , and west " .  He also defined the " north-south issue " , which reflects the gap between rich and poor , as a " core issue " .  
In addition , activities for " the great road of peace " , " unimpeded projects " , " mother for aiding the poor " , " be warm , be patriotic " , " outstretched hands " , " linked hearts " , " volunteers " , " public instruction system " , " social service pledge system " , etc . have been launched .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
The founding of new China abolished the reactionary rule of imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucratic capitalism and once and for all put an end to China 's wretched circumstances , a country going downhill , poor , backward , internally divided and externally being trampled upon by the powers .  The Chinese people becamethe masters of the new country , new society .  Erasing the humiliation of a century , the Chinese people stood tall among the ranks of nations .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States has indeed enjoyed nearly 10 years of sustained economic growth , but in respect of citizens ' rights of existence , the gap between rich and poor in American society is growing and the population living in poverty is increasing .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
However , owing to the irrational international economic order that has been formed for a long time , the benefits received by various countries in globalization are very unbalanced , the developing countries are in a relatively disadvantageous position in the process of globalization , and the gap between the poor and the rich and between the South and the North has been further widened .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
He said , through thejoint efforts of the international community , effective international rulesshould be drawn up on the basis of full participation and democraticconsultation by all countries , to ensure that globalization can help to narrowthe disparities between north and south and between rich and poor , help topromote common development , help the developing countries to benefit fromglobalization , and help to promote balanced , steady , and sustainable worldeconomic development .  
Through agreat historical change , China thoroughly terminated its miserable history ofbeing victimized by foreign aggression and becoming weak and poor , and beganthe new process of making the people rich and making the nation strong .  
Our opposition to hegemonism and power politics is precisely for the sake of building a fair and rational new international order of peace and stability , so that all countries large or small , strong or weak , and rich or poor can treat each other as equals and live together in peace .  
The percentage of China 's poverty-stricken population has been lowered to the lowest level in history and the standard of living of the people has been greatly improved .  We have made a leap from being poor to having sufficient food and clothing and another from having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively well-off life .  
In the wake of expanded market access , tariff reduction , and elimination of non-tariff measures , foreign products , services , and investment will enter the Chinese markets en masse , and the domestic enterprises will face even more intense competition .  The township enterprises , in particular , are marked by the inherent poor quality among many of them , as demonstrated by , one , some enterprises ' extensive management mode .  Their environment is filthy , chaotic , and inferior ;  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
Whether they are large or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , all countries should participate in global economic management on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and jointly create and defend a new international economic order that is just and equitable . "  
It may promote economic and social progress , narrow the gap between the rich and the poor , and break down geographical barriers to the market and to prosperity .  But it also may exclude or leave behind those countries that lag in technological innovation and drive them to a even lower level of development . "  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
Article 2 .  When the principal leaders of local people 's governments , or the chief responsible persons of relevant government departments , who , according to the law and administrative regulations , are found to have neglected their duties , or committed misconduct in performing their official duties , or should be held accountable for their poor leadership with respect to preventing the occurrence of the following extraordinarily serious safety incidents shall be disciplined .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
Organizing party and government organizations to help poor people at fixed points is of great significance to cadres ' understanding the national situation , the grassroots level and the people , to raising the cadres ability to solve actual problems , to maintaining close ties between the party and the people and to improving the work style of various offices .  
At this critical moment for carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future , the party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a relevant meeting to summarize past experience and arrange the work for the next 10 years .  The current meeting will certainly have a profound impact on the work of aiding and developing poor areas for the new period .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
The great achievements made by China in supporting and developing poor areas have made important contributions to promoting economic growth , national unity , frontier security , and social stability , and to helping people to live a comfortable life on the whole . 
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
To make the new project of aiding and supporting poor areas successful , we call for continued arduous efforts on the part of the party and the people throughout the country and further support from various social sectors and coastal developed areas .  
While the economic situation on the island is poor and the public eagerly look forward to being lifted out of depression and seeing unemployment mitigated , the Taiwan authorities have found a little " comfort " in the changeable international climate and impatiently jumped on the bandwagon of " containing China " of the international anti-China forces .  
Li Peng said : China pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy and holds that all countries in the world , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal in international affairs .  All countries have the right to select their own social systems and development courses on the basis of their own national conditions .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
The result is that the gap between the poor and the rich has widened , relations between ethnic groups have become tense , and class confrontations have intensified .  No doubt that the middle - and lower-class have been displeased , many people of the upper class , including such moderate of the Republican Party as Jeffords , also have been complaining quite a lot .  
The relevant departments of the State Council should formulate unified fee standards and systems for compulsory education in poor and rural areas .  The standards of fees for textbooks and miscellaneous expenses in other areas should be formulated by provincial people 's governments according to local conditions .  
From the traditional point of view , Chinese products have the advantage of lower prices because of lower production costs .  Despite the fact that today the people have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by improving production quality and services and adding new features , the practice of increasing market share by exporting more low-priced products remains prevalent .  This has prevented Chinese products from ridding themselves of their " poor quality and low price " image .  Moreover , lowering the price often gives others an excuse to file anti-dumping lawsuits .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .  
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
Military schools and academies and military scientific research institutes should use their favorable conditions to pass scientific knowledge to the people in poor areas , transfer scientific and technological achievements to production , spread the use of advanced techniques , help the masses to master science and technology and thus build up their ability to develop the economy .  
The circular points out : Party committees and political organs at all levels should include the work of giving help to poor areas in their work agenda , make well-coordinated and careful arrangements , formulate concrete plans and work measures , and be strict to enhance the comprehensive efficiency in the work of poverty relief and development according to the specific conditions of the local areas where the troops are stationed . 
We have seen clearly that the poor level of productive forces is a major factor that determines people 's willingness in having children .  In view of this , China has worked out its population program and population policies that conform with reality , which have not only successfully ensured healthy development for the country 's population and family planning undertaking ; but has also served to promote the country 's economic growth , push forward social progress , improve the living standards of the people , and enhance the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .  
Zhu Rongji 's dialogue with township and town cadres and middle and primary school headmasters told him that the fees collected by middle and primary schools in some rural areas are much higher than the standard ones set by the State Council 's relevant departments for the compulsory education in poor rural areas .  
Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
In fact , they are " deadlocks to be resolved . "  While intensifying efforts to publicize the issues of reducing and eliminating poor countries ' debts , the current G-8 summit was unable to implement any new and concrete measures to further reduce and eliminate poor countries ' heavy foreign debts even though $ 53-billion of foreign debts have been accumulatively reduced or exempted from 23 poorest countries in the world .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
A country divided and ravaged by incessant war , corruption in politics , and economic backwardness - - this is the image a chronically poor and weak China projected in the 1930s ; this is also an important reason why Japanese militarists dared to launch a war of aggression against China in a flagrant manner .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
Would they not have ended up just like the Chinese today : poor , backward , ignorant , and rough ? "  When she paid homage to Yasukuni Jinjia herself , she shamelessly said : " I think it was deeply regrettable that Japan was defeated in World War II . In particular , that China became the victor was very unfair and very absurd . "  
Since the Communist Party of China was founded , the Chinese nation has undergone a tremendous change from being poor and backward to thriving and prosperous , from being in a state of broken pieces to unity of a high degree , and from being subjected to bullying and humiliation to standing firm among the nations in the world .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
With a huge amount of funds misappropriated by major shareholders and the parties concerned , a listed company is expected to find itself lacking in reserve strength in seeking development , and entering a strange circle in the end , namely , " outstanding performance in the first year , acceptable performance in the second year , and poor performance in the third year . "  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .

After shutting down nearly 200 various small enterprises which caused serious pollution , Chongqing has also decided to close down another 794 enterprises operated by settlers in the Three Gorges reservoir region which caused serious pollution , which yield poor economic benefits , and which lack economic prospects .  As of now , 16 state , collective , or township and town enterprises , including the Fengjie County Timber Mill have been declared bankrupt or closed .  
The impacts of an economic globalization have proved a major factor that leads to the increasingly widening chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States ; and while new industries , such as the industry of information technology , are reaping in exorbitant profits , the traditional industries of the West , such as the textile industry , are shrinking rapidly .  
Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Regarding the issue of economic globalization , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that the economic globalization has brought about new opportunities of economic development for all countries in the world .  Nevertheless , as the disparity between the rich and the poor in the world has been widening and the contradictions between the South and the North have become more outstanding , those developing countries which are in a weak position are confronting bigger risks and challenges .  
The existing main problems are a low overall standard of product quality , a low ratio of up-to-standard products in a considerable number of categories , the persistent act of producing fake and shoddy products in defiance of repeated bans , and the poor work in supervising and regulating quality .  
Sankei Shimbun published a satirical comic today to mock at the poor showing of Prime Minister Mori at the summit with his frequent slips of tongue .  In the comic , the heads of the other seven countries are staring at Prime Minister Mori who is making his entrance .  They whispering among themselves about something they are most concerned about .  
This year is the last year of the " National Eight-seven Plan for Tackling Tough Problems in Poverty Relief " ; all localities and departments concerned must seriously implement the central arrangements for development for poverty relief ; with poor villages as the main battleground , and with the focus on developing crop cultivation and livestock raising and the construction of basic farmland , they should adhere to the guideline of developmental poverty relief and concentrate forces and increase input in an effort to fulfill this historic task .  
Countries , whether they are great or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , are all equal members in the international community , should follow the purposes of the " UN Charter " and other norms governing international relations , should mutually respect sovereignty and territorial integrity , should practice non-aggression , should not interfere in each other internal affairs , and should thoroughly discard the Cold War mentality .  
The unjust and irrational old international economic order is a major cause that creates a wide gap between rich and poor .  
During the first half of the year , State Council counsellors focused on the central work of the Party and the government , responding enthusiastically to the call from the CPC Central Committee for the " large-scale development of western China . " Eight separate groups made arduous journeys to the midwestern region - - particularly to frontier areas and poor areas - - to conduct survey studies , writing a number of high-quality research reports and making excellent suggestions , which won the high regard and full affirmation of leading comrades in the State Council .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
Factors still exist that threaten peace and hamper development , however , and the current unfairness and irrationalities in the present international order do harm to the independence , sovereignty , and security of the developing countries , while disparities between south and north and poor and rich have further expanded .  
It has also strengthened the execution and supervision of the state compulsory norms and established a report system .  Generally speaking , the quality of the immigration project is good .  However , there are still some problems , such as the relatively poor quality of the design results , the nonstandard invitation of bidding , the undertaking of projects by the units without human quality , the replacement of supervision with quality inspection , and the improper punishment to the persons responsible for causing quality accidents .  
President Jiang Zemin proposed that on the basis of democratic consultation with full participation by the nations , practical international rules should be drawn up to ensure that the process of economic globalization will be able to gain correct guidance and management , advance in the direction of helping to narrow the differences between north and south and rich and poor , and help to promote world economic balance , stability , and sustainable development .  
Grasping those practical issues with which the masses are generally concerned , the autonomous regional government has affirmed ten solid things like effecting long-distance migration to help the poor , bringing air pollution in cities under control , preventing and curing endemic diseases , and so on , and have them vigorously enforced and implemented one by one .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
Under the guidance of the central and local governments , the resources of all social quarters shall be mobilized to strengthen support for the west that is geared toward a specific group and increase the level of support for poor areas and areas inhabited by minorities in the west .  Press ahead with the campaign to " revitalize the border and make the people rich . "  
He pointed out that China 's national tradition regards " peace as precious , " and even when China becomes powerful in the future , it will always be a major factor and force for world peace ; it is a happy event for the world that China is rich and strong , on the other hand , if China is always poor and backward , that would be a great calamity for the world .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
Beginning in 2000 , the task will be pressing and arduous to continue to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the low-income populations living in poor rural areas who have not had sufficient food and clothing and those who have initially but not stably had sufficient food and clothing , and for the people living in poverty mainly in old revolutionary areas , minority nationality areas , pastoral areas , frontier areas , and other particularly poor areas ; and the task of preserving the results of poverty relief and development will be as pressing and arduous .  
As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
Two , we must give top priority to case investigation and make breakthroughs in some typical cases of violation of law and discipline , especially cases of trickery to defraud state investments , abuse of official position to engage in graft and corruption , abuse of official power to seek private gains , and cases where dereliction of duty have resulted in poor construction quality that leads to accidents and cases of corruption hidden behind substandard construction work and so on .  We must put a firm grip on these cases and thoroughly investigate them .  
According to interior media reports , Hengdong County of Hengyang City in Hunan is a poor area ; in recent years the state has arranged key construction projects there , including the Dayuandu pivotal water conservancy projects and the Hengdong section of the Beijing-Zhuhai expressway , which have played a big part in local social and economic work .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
It will hear and review special State Council work reports on strengthening the basic position of agriculture and raising farmers ' income , improving the social security system , implementing a moderate monetary policy , curbing counterfeit and poor products , and intensifying the management of the cultural market .  
The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .  We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
The financial departments at all levels must guarantee funds for the " two supremes " in normal operation and must earnestly help departments involved in political and legal work in remote border areas , poor areas , or areas inhabited by ethnic minorities tackle the problem of lack of funds .  
The water quality is considered to be very poor and not suitable for swimming when the E . coli count is found to be more than 610 per 100 millilitres and the expected health risk is more than 15 cases of minor skin / gastrointestinal illnesses per 1000 swimmers .  
Economic disparities among countries are staggering as the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen and the unjust and inequitable international economic order still puts interests of the developing countries in harm 's way .  
In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .

In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management , governmental subsidies , and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .  
The origin and the causes of this crisis are really very complex : but there are some very startling common factors that existed in the Asian countries which were the worse affected .  They are , private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank supervision , poor macro economic policies and poor corporate governance .  
Every day , 4,000 tonnes of waste paper are produced .  About 2,000 tonnes are either part of domestic waste and go straight to landfills , mostly through USD and RSD collection services , or are of poor quality or contaminated commercial waste that the collectors again take direct to the landfills or refuse transfer stations .  
The monthly rentals for the premises in the building ( at $ 4 per square foot for ground floor units and at $ 2.5 per square foot for upper floor units exclusive of management charges ) are decided by the Government Property Agency having regard to various relevant considerations , including the short period of availability , the design which is primarily for godown purpose with little ancillary office space , the poor condition , and the market rentals in the vicinity .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
The sceptics will go on to suggest that poor performance of the euro to date , coupled with nationalistic resentment of the imminent loss of one 's own banknotes - to many an emotive symbol of national identity and sovereignty - might yet cause a wave of popular opposition to the euro at the eleventh hour . 
At times when our Sun is active , tremendous explosions known as flares and coronal mass ejections can hurl billions of tonnes of matter into space in one stroke .  These cataclysmic events can trigger magnetic storms on Earth , resulting in poor radio communications or disrupted power grids .  Potential hazards to astronauts or satellites in space can be even more serious .  
According to the quarterly newsletter " I lens " published by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance last month , the general insurance industry registered poor performance in 1999 .  Total underwriting losses of the general business insurers for the year reached an unprecedented high level of HK $ 1,062 million , the worst year since the Insurance Authority started to collect statistics in 1990 .  
As the existing pier is in poor condition with wide spread reinforcement corrosion and concrete spalling , it is expected that increasing higher maintenance effort and expenditure will be required .  
As the unfair and unreasonable international political and economic order has not been fundamentally changed yet , economic globalization has exacerbated the uneven development among countries and regions and widened , in particular , the gap between the North and the South and between the rich and the poor .  
Over the past fifty years , we have had opportunity to witness the achievement of China moving from a poor , awkward , turbulent and fragmented country into a modern , confident and forward looking nation - a nation that has taken her rightful place amongst the community of nations of the world and a nation according to some forecast will become the second largest economy in the world soon . 
The HKSARG affirms the importance of intellectual property protection so as to provide incentives for research and development into new medicines and , at the same time , we recognise that this objective must be balanced with the need to ensure adequate access to existing medicines by rich and poor alike . 
Ideally , the minimum relevant income level should be set at a level high enough to exclude those employees in the lower income bands from contributing so as to alleviate their financial hardship during times when economic conditions are poor .  This level , on the other hand , should not be too high as to drastically reduce in the long run the amount of accrued benefits for retirement .  
" As to poor families in public housing , the Government has put in place all the elements of a comprehensive safety net .  Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .  Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .  
Sergeant Lee Chi-hing said : " With the beat radio remaining the primary means for communication , the Force mobile phone can be used in situations such as poor radio reception , or when lengthy reports or sensitive information needs to be called into the console .  
Soon it was discovered that bamboo was not strong enough to stand continuous beating , so poor and yet talented musicians began to look around , during the 1930 ' s , for metal items that could be beaten to produce a sound , like paint buckets , biscuit tins , garbage bins , and even abandoned car parts .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
Following from the social philosophy and the four pillars I have just mentioned , the Government in the past five and a half years has put in a lot of resources and efforts to provide care and assistance for the physical and psychosocial well-being of the elderly , and to assist the disadvantaged , the poor and the unemployed with an emphasis on enhancing , not impeding , their will to self-reliance . 
At present , the Social Welfare Department ( SWD ) provides residential services for people with disabilities and the elderly primarily through financial subventions to non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) .  Amongst these residential services , Long Stay Care Homes are for mentally ill patients with long-term residual disabilities whilst Hostels for Mentally Handicapped Persons are for people with varying degrees of mental handicap .  Residential services for elders suffering from poor health or physical / mental weaknesses are provided in Care and Attention Homes ( including those for the Aged Blind ) and Nursing Homes .  
Because of our economic construction in recent years , the average family income has increased sharply . The general living standard has risen and the gap between the rich and the poor has narrowed .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
In Taiwan , as elsewhere in the world , prisons have historically been dark , dank and dirty places , with poor food , unsanitary conditions , and inmates forced to do hard labor under stern , sometimes cruel supervision .  
They asked her to raise her left hand if she wanted to marry the rich and ugly son living to the east , and to raise her right hand if she wanted to marry the handsome , but poor son living to the west .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
After September of each year , the northeast seasonal winds are very strong , causing much of the soil to be blown away , and exposing the sandstone layer . In addition to the lack of humus , the soil is extremely poor and barren . Although 55 percent of the island is suitable for planting , yet due to economic inefficiency , mostly peanuts and corn are grown .  
Britain is a prime example . After it became a welfare state in 1945 , the government took on the responsibility of caring for the poor , the handicapped , the sick , and the unemployed from cradle to grave , but a deepening fiscal crisis forced the government to raise taxes during the 1960 ' s .  
Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .  
Changes in internal secretions within the mother 's body during pregnancy are the cause , making it rather easy to develop swelling of the gums . Expectant mothers often have a poor appetite and abnormal eating habits . If they neglect oral hygiene , they may easily develop cavities and inflamed gums . Pain relievers are rarely prescribed to relieve the pain to protect the health of the unborn infant , and consequently the expectant mother has to endure the pain .  
The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them . During the seventeenth century the aborigines still lived by hunting and fishing , and the Han Chinese immigrants were mostly poor farmers and fishermen who left no written records behind , while the historical documents of the Cheng clan ( descendants of the Ming loyalist Koxinga ) were destroyed during the Ching dynasty .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
After World War , Japan was a defeated nation , production stopped , people were poor ; but despite the defeat , occupation , and collapse of the economy , because the bureaucratic system held firm , the government could act smoothly according to established laws and maintain social order and economic production , enabling the nation to quickly recover .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
A study of the behavioral problems of gifted children in elementary schools in Taipei found that 50 percent of them had had psychological difficulties such as " I 'd like to do a lot of things but I do n't have the courage , " " I 'm afraid of being put in a poor class in middle school " and " I have a lot of bad habits . "  
As long as 120 years ago , just after it was founded , it treated applicants of all backgrounds just the same - - whether black or white , rich or poor , male or female . It is a citadel of academia that lives up to the ideal of " education without discrimination , " in the words of Confucius .  
In the late 19th century , when colleges on the East Coast were still debating whether to open their doors to the general public , Cornell already accepted students of all backgrounds - - no matter whether they were black or white , rich or poor , male or female , all were treated the same .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
The resistance to illness among children with Down 's is poor , and they easily catch infections . Add to this that many of those with Down 's suffer compound illnesses , with half having congenital heart problems , with others possibly having irregularly shaped intestines , leukemia , abnormal functioning of the thyroid , and other conditions , which can easily be fatal .  
According to a study by the Training and Education Commission of the Ministry of Education , behavioral problems in junior and high school , such as running away from home , skipping school , promiscuous sexual behavior and poor interpersonal relationships are all intimately related to family problems , such as parents and children not getting along or parental absence , divorce or an extramarital affair .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people . Dr . Lai Yu-chia has just completed a half-year stint on the roving volunteer team .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
Waking from a dream of riches only to be executed , you feel that life is short / Life and death are fated , neither rich nor poor can escape / The seasons change , the sun sets in the west and the water still flows / Where is the general 's horse today , the field is covered with flowers and grass / Life is a lonely boat , day and night the water flows upward / The boat is smashed and repaired / Death brings respite from the affairs of the world .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
Tachen Island is located off the coast of Zhejiang Province . It is a poor and obscure little place whose cuisine is largely limited to seafood . Thus , for example , their " ginger tea noodles " is made with dried fish , shrimp shells , and other seafood fried up with ginger and sesame oil added to the noodles . It 's a special dish that Tachen people give to postpartum mothers to help them regain their strength .  
People who easily have sore hips , shoulders and backs , or who have trouble breathing , poor digestion , prolapse of the rectum , hemorrhoids , unstable blood pressure , a hunched back , a shrunken neck , a protruding lower abdomen , or a large waist , can all use this sitting method .  
Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
In fact the requirements are very broad : people over the age of 65 living on their own - - no matter whether they are weak , lonely , poor or just plain bored - - are all qualified .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
Liang Chiungpai notes that not only do pickled veggies keep well for a long time , they come in many flavors , covering the gamut from sour and salty to sweet and hot ; they also help relieve that bloated feeling . Available to both rich and poor alike , and appropriate for both holidays and ordinary meals , these little appetizers are eminently suited to accompany fine cuisine .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
" They are an important reminder to Taiwan 's society to open its eyes and see the poor and the weak among us , " says Li Chia-tung , Dean of Providence University and a one-time volunteer in a Calcutta hospice . He feels that people , especially people who live in self-proclaimed wealthy and civilized countries , love beauty and do their best to avoid seeing ugly and painful things . This even includes many who work in the field of religion .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Juju Wang , an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Tsing Hua University , notes that all of the central government agencies are located up north in Taipei . The city has two-thirds of the island 's universities , over 90 percent of the corporate headquarters , and over 90 percent of its media . The magnetic draw of Taipei has made it an over-loaded city with a deteriorating environment - " a poor place to live amid great wealth . "  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
Recently Cardinal Shan has been promoting the establishment of a Catholic benevolent fund , and the strengthening of service to aboriginal people , foreign workers , the poor and ill , and those in prison . Moreover , the Taiwan Catholic Church is planning a major conference on " New Good News for the New Century , " to be held in 2000 , in the hope of helping Taiwan society as it adjusts to rapid change .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
Just as there are major gaps in outsiders ' understanding of aboriginal culture in general , more detailed research needs to be carried out about the mathematical conceptions of aborigines . This research should be broken down according to age , tribe , area , social situation , and so forth . It 's wrong to make a sweeping generalization and say that " aborigines ' poor performance in math is or is not related to culture , " argues Wang Wei-chang , a photographer who often visits aboriginal communities .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
During a visit by Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan , the local people , exasperated by the effects of two calamities in quick succession , aimed a torrent of invective against the government 's inappropriate planning and poor preventative measures . Some people blamed the flooding on inadequacies in straightening work carried out on downstream sections of the Keelung River , causing flooding further upstream .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
Back when golf was the exclusive domain of the " lofty and rich , " many children from poor families headed to the golf courses to serve as caddies for the wealthy , eventually making reputations themselves among Asia 's few elite professional golfers . Such players as Lu Liang-huan , Hsieh Min-nan , and Chen Chih-chung share similar stories of struggle , from poverty to caddy , and finally to professional golfer .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
When news of the gold rush in Australia reached China in the 1850s , poor farmers , fishermen , and unemployed drifters from Xinning ( today 's Taishan County ) in Guangdong Province , searching for a path of survival or improvement for their families , crossed the sea to Australia . There they settled in places like Adelaide , Bendigo , and Ballarat on the east coast , and in the mountain areas of Queensland state , hoping to fulfill their gold-panning dreams .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
Bringing together rich and poor , male and female , young and old , it forms a many-sided portrait of life in Taipei , divided into four sections : " Car , " " Home , " " Body " and " Feeling . " From the lives of people who consider themselves normal , she uncovers so much that is humorous and twisted .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
The book indicates the positions of " reflex zones " on the feet that correspond to the organs of the urinary , digestive , circulatory and immune systems , and states that the nerve endings in these reflex zones are linked to the major organs of the body . People 's feet spend months and years closed up in " shoe hell , " so that the blood circulation is restricted , and this can easily lead to poor health .  
At present , he is living with his son , and though he is as poor as before , at least the cultural foundation that his friends at home and abroad cooperatively established provides him with a monthly stipend of NT $ 50,000 for his living expenses . He still makes it back to Taiwan on occasion , residing in the quiet flat he rents in Tamsui .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
The Department of Health advises citizens that the most practical preventive measures involve old standbys : careful washing of hands , keeping surroundings clean and well ventilated , avoiding locations that are crowded or have poor ventilation , avoiding unnecessary trips to the doctor or hospital , eating a balanced diet , and getting appropriate amounts of rest and exercise .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory . In recent years he has taken a succession of odd jobs to make ends meet . Currently he is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the children . Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
Li said that China holds that all nations , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal members of the international community China is ready to increase friendly cooperation with Estonia in every area , economic and trade areas in particular  
according to the resolution , the biggest obstacles to the realization of the right to development lie at " the international macro economic level as reflected in the widening gap between the north and the south , the rich and the poor "  
He reiterated that the Chinese government has always adopted an independent foreign policy for peace and held that all countries , no matter they are big or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , should be on an equal footing  
It attributed this alarming decline to a rapid population growth , uneven and poor rainfall patterns , environmental degradation , civil conflicts , an unfavorable international economic environment and inappropriate domestic policies  
In countries where urbanization has taken place at a rapid pace , urban stress affecting human health , particularly that of the urban poor who live in unserviced areas and often make a living from collecting solid wastes , has increased .  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Unfortunately , international economic relations are still marked by the bipolar attitude responsible for the growing gap between rich and poor countries .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
The Fund also supported a wide range of activities to further integrate family planning into primary healthcare networks , improve the quality of existing services and extend integrated MCH / FP services to poor and remote areas .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
In Iraq , hyperinflation has decreased the buying power of the poor and even middle classes as the price of essential commodities has skyrocketed , while the average monthly salary of civil servants has remained stagnant .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter for rapidly growing populations and for the currently deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling and environmentally sustainable approach to shelter development and improvement .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
The plans focused on vulnerable social groups and poor geographical areas , addressing minimum basic needs with the aim of improving the quality of life and expanding the base of the decisionmaking process .  
The Sudanese Government had prepared a comprehensive plan to combat poverty by raising rural living standards through economic and social development plans , with similar projects directed at poor urban dwellers .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
On the political and economic levels , the world continued to be divided into rich countries and poor countries , a polarization which seriously threatened human survival and the maintenance of security and peace .  
Poverty eradication and social and economic policies for standards of living must be based on a recognition of the human dignity of the poor , the weak and the humble .  
To cite one major example , in and around Rwanda the circumstances challenged every aspect of supply operations remote location , poor roads in surrounding countries , meagre local stocks of basic supplies and unprecedented population movements .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
Promotion of access to land and security of tenure for all urban residents , in particular the poor , through improved land market transparency and innovative mechanisms to utilize public and private land , including fiscal incentives to bring unutilized land into use , improved land-delivery and land-tenure systems and , where appropriate , direct government and municipal landownership ;  
The Assistant Secretary-General then stated that rural human settlements issues should not be neglected , as the overall situation of the urban and rural poor had become worse , with 40 per cent more people living in absolute poverty compared to 15 years ago .  
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
The timeliness of launching a global movement to ensure prosperity for all in this era of rapid globalization of economic activities was noted at the World Summit for Social Development , held in Copenhagen . In Sri Lanka , the Samurdhi programme is designed to activate the entrepreneurial potential of the poor . 
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
This new framework of solidarity would break with the almost exclusive , dependence on financial inflows from abroad by better exploiting the potential of trade , private investment and access to technology and reforming international financial institutions so as to better integrate them with other parts of the United Nations system and make them better suited to take care of the needs of poor countries in economic and social development .  
The international community has learned from hard experience that initiatives implemented to supply the poor with basic needs have been less than successful when based solely on concerns for welfare , economic growth and income levels .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The resulting problems are , among others , sexually transmitted diseases , including infection with HIV ; early pregnancies ; lack of hygiene and sanitation , leading to infection , infestation and diarrhoea ; genetic and congenital diseases ; psychological and mental diseases ; narcotic and psychotropic drug abuse ; misuse of alcohol and tobacco ; unwarranted risk-taking and destructive activity , resulting in unintentional injuries ; malnutrition ; and poor spacing of births .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .

Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
" Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
The National Working Committee on Children and Women , established under the State Council for monitoring the NPA , will mobilize leaders at key administrative levels to strengthen programme delivery , allocate adequate resources , support local mobilization action and monitor implementation of the NPA . 59 .  In poor counties and ethnic minority areas , empowerment activities will be adapted to the local culture , knowledge and needs .  
Such services must be adapted to specific socio-cultural contexts ; be extended to poor women , minorities , unmarried women and adolescents ; promote healthy and responsible reproductive behaviour ; pay special attention to young adults and men ; and promote the use of condoms and other barrier methods of contraception .  
They considered educative measures and publicity as most important to curb the level of violence against women and asked whether particular programmes existed to deal with the problem of violence against particularly marginalized groups , such as refugee , poor and disabled women .  In reply to further questions , the representatives stated that assault and battery , whether committed inside or outside the home , could be prosecuted without the consent of the victim .  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
Many non-governmental organizations feel that progress could be faster , pointing to continued forest damage and the apparently low levels of grass-roots involvement , and calling for the implementation of the FAO Peasants Charter to correct skewed land ownership or access patterns , which concentrate human pressure on the few forests that are accessible to the poor , thereby contributing to their degradation and loss .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .  
This has been a critical step forward in the context of translating project-induced increases in agricultural productivity and often a strengthened resource base into adequate diets for rural poor households .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
With rising incomes the poor should be able to afford rudimentary but satisfactory sanitation facilities with some technical advice on sewage disposal facilities from the Government , but it will remain the responsibility of the Government to provide basic health care and safe drinking water facilities to the poor wherever they are located .  
The urban poor are the primary victims of municipal sewage discharged into water bodies and the improper disposal of solid waste and toxic chemicals .  
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The objective is to assist the large numbers of the homeless and those living in poor shelter and unhealthy neighbourhoods , whether in urban slums and squatter areas or in poor rural areas , to meet their housing needs .  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of any social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
It was agreed that the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in particular input subsidies , needed careful examination , with special attention being paid to distributive problems , especially that of the negative impact on the poor .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy and numeric problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .  SFD executes six programmes , dealing with public works , community development , enterprise development , employment and retraining , institutional development and public transport .  
It has required , for example , that UNDP continue to adjust and focus its programmes in the countries it serves , shifting its work upstream to broad policies and programmes , reducing the proliferation of isolated projects and addressing difficult goals such as providing the poor with decent jobs and even difficult concepts like good governance and implementation capacity . 
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
Weak economic and accounting data systems , poor tender procedures , secrecy of budget documents and deficient mass media were identified as the main explanatory factors .  
These internally displaced persons have suffered the hardships typical of other refugees and internally displaced persons : they were forced to flee their homes and established community structures at very short notice , unaware of where they were going or how they would end up and having to endure temporary shelter and extremely poor living conditions .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .

Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .  
A special initiative entitled " Intensified cooperation with countries and peoples in greatest need " aims to enable poor countries to establish equitable and sustainable health systems tailored to their specific needs .  
Second , the strategy to be pursued must be based on growth with equity , the full participation of all actors in development , including civil society , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the poor themselves , and should involve a decentralized approach in which decisions and resources allocation can be made at the local level , taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the target groups or areas .  
Such emphasis on women is warranted since women , who compose more than half of the world 's poor , often face special legal and social obstructions in carrying out business and economic activities , despite their record of being responsible entrepreneurs and the principal contributors to the welfare of the family .  
Taiwan sought recognition of its right to international representation on equal terms as those enjoyed by other countries so that it could be a constructive voice within the United Nations , cooperate in programmes for the economic and social development of poor countries , and seek solutions to the current United Nations economic crisis , which had repercussions for Taiwan as well .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Another institution with a direct bearing on the process of reconstruction and improving the living conditions of poor groups is the Social Investment Fund , which channels assistance to poor sectors of the population , including those uprooted by the conflict , thereby meeting the dual objective of combating poverty and strengthening the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
They were confident that their standard of living was improving , that their poor would soon be employed , that their children would become better educated , and that they would be taken seriously as economic actors on the world stage .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
Preschool institutions , homes for children deprived of parental care , disabled children and youth institutions for juvenile delinquents , are also in an increasingly difficult material situation , manifested by a poor quality of food and a considerable decline of standards , including poor hygienic standards , insufficient heating , inadequate maintenance , the impossibility to keep facilities and equipment in proper repair .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
In India , programmes to guarantee employment to the rural poor and unemployed youth , meet the nutritional , educational and health needs of women and promote their empowerment , and mass literacy programmes were central to the realization of situation-specific strategies .  
it was the economic and social marginalization of poor countries which deprived children of the right to realize their physical and intellectual potential , complete their education , find work and become well-adjusted , economically productive and socially responsible adults .  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
We should be happy to do so without repeating any of the recent tired , uncharitable and inaccurate nostrums about the death of the obligation to accord economic preferences to poor countries , even as we clamour that human rights and humanitarianism have now been elevated to a place of honour in the international pantheon .  
All these falsities , many of them recorded in United Nations documents , hide the bankruptcy of development prospects for most of the poor countries , which is already threatening world stability and aggravating the ecological deterioration we all recognized several years ago at the historic Rio Conference .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
The United Nations was established 51 years ago with a focus on the maintenance of peace and security , and while that remains the objective , the linkage between peace and economic and social development , enshrined in the Charter , must be recognized and strengthened if the world is to escape the inexorable consequences of the continuously widening gap between rich and poor nations .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In response to our d \ x { 5e66 } arche , the Secretary-General informed us that he had submitted to the executive heads of the specialized agencies a series of proposals for the establishment of inter-agency task forces aimed at providing strong coordinated support for country-level action , in the areas of the extension of basic social services , access by the poor to productive assets and employment and the creation of an enabling environment for poverty eradication and social development . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
Though aware of the precarious security situation and the poor condition of the infrastructure in Goma and the consequent need for official government assistance , the Commission considered that the insistence of Zairian officials on attending all its interviews was obstructive , unhelpful and not in keeping with the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1013 ( 1995 ) , and especially paragraphs 5 ( a ) and ( e ) thereof . 
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
However , administered or indicative maximum or minimum prices still exist in many countries of the region for selected agricultural exports or basic foodstuffs with the rationale of protecting the interests of the small farmers and the poor .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
In addition , prenatal exposure to illicit drugs and factors such as premature birth , low birth weight and poor relations between the child and care-giver in early childhood have been identified as problematic in relation to later development and , consequently , as precursors of the risk factors listed in the table above .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Conduct thematic studies to evaluate poverty alleviation strategies , especially with reference to women workers in the informal sector - on such themes as poverty , household food security and gender , focusing on the feminization of poverty as expressed in food insecurity ; conduct studies with respect to adapting successful credit systems in different socio-cultural areas , with particular emphasis on the needs of poor rural women , and to integrating information on credit systems into non-formal education ; undertake case-studies on the role of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Many poverty-stricken low latitude countries with rapid population growth , high illiteracy and large deficiencies in terms of trained manpower suffer from a complex water scarcity , in the form of particularly problematic environmental conditions with which they must cope , such as monsoon climates , erratic rainfall and poor soils . 
These include unwanted and unsafe sex ( giving rise to teenage pregnancy , HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases ) ; psychoactive substance use , including tobacco and alcohol ; violence and accidents ; and poor nutrition and certain common endemic diseases .  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
The main focus of the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable segments of the populations .  
In terms of the poor penetration of agricultural areas that required specialized types of services , the Working Group stated that opportunities existed to provide alternative services such as radio communication systems , space or ground based .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
ESCAP has prepared and disseminated a publication on enhancing the role of non-governmental organizations in implementing the regional Agenda for Action ; convened a regional workshop on guidelines for implementing the Agenda ; held an expert group meeting on the enhancement of social security for the poor ; and a meeting of senior officials on a policy framework for lifelong preparation for old age .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
We must note with deep concern the delays , particularly in the areas of the quartering of UNITA troops ; the selection of soldiers for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces ( FAA ) ; and the slow process of the transfer of UNITA commanding officers to join the FAA , as well as the handing over to UNAVEM III of insufficient quantities of weapons and the poor quality of those handed over , and the continued presence of UNITA police .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled " Macroeconomic policy questions " ;  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .  
The key factors which contribute to inefficient energy-use in the transport sector are growing road congestion in urban areas , increasing dependence on cars , and use of vehicles which are not fuel efficient coupled with poor vehicle and road maintenance in developing countries .  
Welcomes the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative endorsed by the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund and the Development Committee of the World Bank , designed to enable eligible heavily indebted poor countries to achieve a sustainable debt situation through coordinated action by all creditors on the basis of adjustment efforts by the debtor countries necessary to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
However , the initiative fell short of the expectations of the heavily indebted poor countries in three respects : the debt sustainability criteria were still restrictive ; appropriate flexibility was needed in determining country eligibility ; and a more realistic time _ frame for eligibility should be offered .  
Indonesia 's experience illustrated the region 's rapid transition from an economy where , just over a quarter of a century ago , 60 per cent of its population had been classified as poor to one where an annual average growth of 7 per cent had been sustained over two decades , and where the incidence of absolute poverty now affected less than 14 per cent of the total population .

With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
All countries should increase their mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field , eliminate unequal practices in trade and economic relations , and do away with discriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
As part of the follow-up to the Social Summit , Governments have reported a variety of actions towards the eradication of poverty : adopting national targets for poverty reduction ; promoting job creation and growth ; maintaining effective safety nets , including comprehensive social security , universal health care and education services ; providing adequate housing ; enhancing social integration of the poor ; and undertaking studies and surveys to improve national information on poverty .  
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Indian society is marked by a rigid hierarchical social stratification which divides the country into two nations : the one comprising the majority , who are poor , uneducated and illiterate , particularly in rural areas , and the other , consisting of the minority which holds the reins of power and forms the economic , social and cultural \ x { 5e68 } ite .  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
The Conference welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and hoped that it would be reinforced by additional bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce the debt stock of all African countries .  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
The result was unrealistic national economic and fiscal policy-making , compounded by the poor administrative capacity of many governments to collect revenues .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
The Government with its various structures has found itself unable to ensure systemwide and effective management of the economic and social processes and proper implementation of the reforms ; its has displayed poor initiative and spent its time largely " putting out fires " .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing , a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , the sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival . 
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
Global Knowledge 97 will address a fundamental challenge facing developing countries and the international development community in the information age : given the vital role of knowledge in economic and social development , how can developing countries , and in particular the worlds poor , harness knowledge for development , participate in the global information economy and gain access to new tools for life-long learning ?  
In the health sector , United Nations observers regularly report an exceptionally serious deterioration in the health infrastructure : a high infant mortality rate and high rates of morbidity and mortality in general , poor and inadequate storage conditions for supplies , an unreliable supply of electricity and back-up generators , faulty or non-functioning air-conditioning , defective cold-storage , interrupted water supplies , broken / leaking sewage systems and non-functioning hospital waste disposal systems .  
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women and specifically address the special needs of girls and women as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents , rural and urban poor , persons in remote or neglected areas , and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " . 
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
The Metro Manila city and town mayors have agreed to pursue a common resettlement site for their respective urban poor constituents who need to be relocated because they are occupying dangerous zones and critical areas for government infrastructure projects .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .  
History has shown that the huge present-day inequalities between developed and poor countries are the result of centuries of plundering and exploitation during which civilizations , social structures and indigenous modes of production were destroyed and during which the ecosystems of Africa , America and Asia were pillaged .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Gender discrimination was often practised against specific social groups , such as migrant workers , especially undocumented " illegal " workers coming from " poor " countries , including indigenous women .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
The Bretton Woods institutions had made a major step in that direction by endorsing the action programme of the initiative to reduce the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries ; under that initiative the three main groups of creditor countries had confirmed that they would take coordinated , simultaneous , but independent action , and would share the costs equitably ; they had also accepted a flexible structure and a case-by-case approach to take into account the characteristics of the economies of the heavily indebted poor countries .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
We want it to be a strong , principled and effective body , the common inheritance of all mankind , not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States , but the guardian of all , especially the poor , the weak and the defenceless . 
Breakdowns in public health as a result of insufficient coverage and the poor operation and maintenance of existing water supply systems are now frequent , though rarely reported until spectacular rates of epidemiological transmission occur .  
Incineration , mainly of medical waste and combustible hazardous materials , has been practised widely in the region , but , it has not generally been efficient because of poor maintenance of plants , manpower shortage and improper choice of facilities .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
At the national level , numerous charitable organizations and benevolent societies provided medical and material assistance to the poor and needy .  
During their extended phase , all current projects would continue to address several common themes and issues critical to enhancing impact at the grass-roots level and improving the living conditions of poor and disadvantaged people .  
Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have " dualistic economies " , with the existence of great disparities between rich and poor , urban and rural areas , and central and peripheral geographic zones .  
They are located in fragile ecosystems and have been subject to strong degradation for many years , owing to environmental stress ( arid climate , poor soils , strong erosion , overgrazing and demographic expansion ) .  
Particularly in the social field , advisory services and group training proved to be the most effective means to reach local governments and grass-roots people , including the urban and rural poor , women , children , youth , the aged and the handicapped .  
BAHAMONDES ( Canada ) said that the efforts of the United Nations to eradicate poverty constituted both a moral imperative and a collective undertaking with a direct bearing on the interests of all countries , rich and poor alike .  
One of the major objectives of the camp was to upgrade trainers skills in adapting existing training materials and designing new ones to meet the needs of various target groups in urban and rural areas , with emphasis on the poor .  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
If there is no determined international concerted effort to eradicate poverty and to improve the quality of life of the poor , then we will have the classical scenario of poverty breeding environmental decay .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
This relates to the complex question of international and national transfers to internalize positive externalities by supporting forest-based sustainable livelihoods of the rural poor .  
With the withdrawal of the State from direct provision of housing or housing subsidies to the poor and the deregulation of the rental market , the poor are exploited by private property owners , often paying over half of their meagre income on rent .  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
At regional higher educational establishments which , like Jalal _ Abad University , were set up simply by combining a number of technical secondary schools and without the requisite teaching materials , equipment , premises or qualified teaching staff , the quality of instruction is poor .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
It has been aggravated by a number of negative social phenomena , such as the deterioration in the health of poor people due to poor nutrition , school leaving caused by a disruption in the normal functioning of educational and cultural establishments , and an increase in crime , and in the moral decay of adults , resulting in more and various forms of violence .  
Social care benefits and pensions are directed to the disabled , lonely elderly , invalids , the poor , families with four or more children , the unemployed , and those with an income providing less than the established minimum standard of living .  
Being cognizant of the importance of focusing upon the family , which is the primary unit of any society , and on economic entities in the fight against poverty , the Government orients its activities towards changing the current inert status of poor families living below the poverty line , as mere recipients of aid .  
Governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with women , youth and children carry out many activities aimed not only at preserving humane traditions practised in Mongolian families and inherited from our ancestors , including reverence and care of parents , support for the poor , and respect for elderly and pregnant women , but also at enriching them in new settings and passing them on to future generations . 
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
The programme is aimed at poor families living in minimal housing conditions and in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archaeological reserves or on private property , persons over 18 years of age , and persons who belong to a family unit with an income of less than two monthly minimum wages when they can prove that the family has no assets and have expressed a desire to purchase a plot . 
The bail-out strategies resorted to when a crisis occurred were becoming increasingly problematic : they protected creditors from bearing the responsibility of poor decisions , placing the burden entirely on debtors , tended to encourage imprudent lending practices on the part of international lenders and required such a huge amount of funding that they were reaching the limits of political acceptability .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
In order to reverse that trend , it was essential to demonstrate to donor Governments that development assistance was fruitful : that it led to tangible improvements for the poor and was not wasted in bureaucratic tangles or by improper practices or misconduct .  
It should be borne in mind that the current situation of millions of children in many parts of the world remained critical as a result of poor economic and social conditions , poverty , armed conflicts , the exploitation of child labour and the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , and that the number of children infected with HIV / AIDS had risen at an alarming rate .  
The aims of Covenant House are : to identify and attempt to assist in solving the problems of the urban poor , especially abandoned or neglected children ; to explore and participate in the identification of the social , psychological and physical problems of these children ; and to stimulate public awareness of the need for effective youth-care facilities .  
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
The executive heads of organizations in the United Nations system outlined the elements of a shared strategy and committed themselves to the concerted effort by all agencies towards poverty eradication and also to playing a supportive and catalytic role in mobilizing the energies and resources of all development actors Governments , the private sector , civil society , donors and above all the poor themselves in the campaign against poverty .  
These are particularly difficult times for the families of mineworkers and industrial workers who have no revenues from the land ( poverty ratio of 44.33 per cent ) , poor urban families with a large number of children , families with mentally or physically handicapped members , adults or elderly persons without relatives unable to fend for themselves , pensioners with a minimum pension , urban families who have provided shelter to refugee families from war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia , etc .  
Reasons for this unsustainable pattern of development in the ESCWA region include poor institutional arrangements , deficiency in environmental , economic and social information , a lack of public participation in the decision-making process , and severe inadequacy in institutional capacities and qualified human resources .  
In the Asia and the Pacific region , while continuing its important partnership with the Governments of each country , UNDP formed strategic partnerships with civil society organizations , NGOs , women 's groups , trade organizations , the private sector , advocates for the environment and against child labour , politicians , parliamentarians , and poor urban and rural slum communities themselves .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ; special issues of least developed countries / Africa / heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
While non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) were a driving force for social development , the steady increase in poverty among the hard core poor and the growing disparity in levels of consumption indicated that the poorest sectors could be better addressed by community-based organizations capable of developing innovative programmes that took into account the non-static characteristics of poverty .  
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
It is because they recognize that , " in an unequal society , the families below the poverty line are doomed to remain poor in absolute as well as relative terms " , that some countries have resorted to affirmative action , equal opportunity laws and other pro-active measures to correct gross disparities at the start . 
While recognizing the efforts made by the State party in the area of education , the Committee remains concerned at the high drop _ out rate for males in the upper grades of primary school , the poor reading ability or primary school males , the high incidence of truancy , lack of relevant learning material , insufficient numbers of trained and qualified teachers , and the tendency towards teaching methods that are almost exclusively exam oriented .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .  
As experienced by some developing countries , the calculated product-specific AMS of a market price support measure could become a negative figure when the administered market price dropped below the ERP nominally fixed to the world price in the 1986-1988 base period to meet the objective of supporting food purchases by poor households . 
" The aggression , which deprived millions of sick and poor people of their right to affordable treatment , constituted a flagrant violation of the Sudan 's sovereignty and territories and a stark violation of all international norms , laws and charters , including the Charter of the United Nations Organization .  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
The meeting also identified a number of constraints in the development of microcredit programmes , including the lack of reliable sources of finance , especially at the start of a programme ; difficulty of determining appropriate interest rates on loans for the poor ; lack of an enabling environment due to unfavourable government regulatory systems ; and hostile banking sectors and lack of support for training institutions .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
The positive effects of air transport on the immediate living conditions of the very poor can readily be seen in the emergency distribution of essential foods , medicines and other commodities , and in the transport of health and social workers to remote locations where traditional means of transport are often impractical or impossible .  
According to the first African Competitiveness Report , published by the World Economic Forum in 1998 , the most important problematic factors for doing business in sub-Saharan Africa are , inter alia , ( a ) tax regulation regimes , ( b ) difficulties in raising local financing , ( c ) weak infrastructure and ( d ) poor economic governance .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
While welcoming the recent developments in connection with the enhanced heavily indebted poor country ( HIPC ) initiative arising from the Cologne Summit , faster and deeper debt relief is required in order to enable African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
Those overall trends masked the serious debt problems faced by the heavily indebted poor countries and the fact that a growing number of middle-income developing countries had experienced serious payments problems , aggravated by the contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis ( A / 54 / 370 , paras . 3 to 5 ) .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
Human-centred development , the concept outlined at Copenhagen , would enable the poor to enjoy basic political and economic freedoms while focusing on practical and effective ways of alleviating their suffering .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .

A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
In order to ensure that the benefits of globalization were enjoyed by all countries , rich and poor , it was essential to adopt and promote a multilateral approach by reshaping the current structure of the existing international institutions and their regulatory mechanisms . 
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Mr . Aujali ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that he associated himself with the statement made by the representative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and that the United Nations was aware of the harmful effects of debt , which had slowed the economic and social development of the heavily indebted poor countries , leaving them unable to meet the basic social needs of their people .  Those most affected by that situation were children , women and older persons .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
I call upon every Member State , large and small , developed and developing , rich and poor , to work cooperatively to find meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this growing international problem and challenge .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
However , we can not fail to point out that this benefit will not come to everyone equally ; nor can we accept passively the idea that the great majority of people in underdeveloped countries are doomed by massive , dire poverty , hunger , poor health and malnutrition not to be a part of these optimistic statistics but , rather , to be included in the morbidity and mortality statistics characteristic of the less developed regions of the world .  
In this respect , Tunisia calls for international solidarity so as to put an end to the existing disparities between the rich and poor countries , between those with sufficient resources to provide their citizens with a happy old age and enough to live on , and those whose meagre resources are insufficient to meet adequately the many needs of their people , especially the elderly .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
Since then , Egypt has embarked upon reforming its economy and has implemented structural adjustment programmes to achieve economic growth aimed at improving the living standards of the Egyptian people while establishing social safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable groups of our society .  
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
Even if it is established that primary responsibility for the implementation of existing international commitments belongs to national Governments , it is important to stress the irreplaceable role of the United Nations and of the whole international community in the mobilization of resources and support for the national efforts of poor and deprived countries .  
We are providing social care for the elderly , orphans , the disabled and poor families , as well as special care for the people of rural areas , including economic and social necessities aimed at limiting urban migration .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
Encourages non-governmental organizations , private funding institutions and individual donors to organize and support assistance programmes and missions tailored to the needs of areas where psychological psychiatric problems are prevalent among the population , in particular among poor urban and rural women , with a view to providing not only primary treatment but also training for family members and or other persons who may take over the care of the afflicted persons ;  
The urban poor , especially women and children , are forced to live in makeshift shelters in appalling and degrading conditions presenting hazards for both physical and mental health .  
From the point of view of labour rights , globalization was encouraging fragmentation and uncertainty ; as TNCs escaped national accountability , the poor were becoming increasingly disenfranchised , subsidies formerly granted to labour were being redirected to attract international capital , and the burden of taxes was shifting increasingly from capital to labour .  
In the context of its contribution to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , ILO was currently developing an urban employment programme focused on more and better jobs in the informal sector aimed , among other things , at improving the living and working environment in poor urban neighbourhoods and increasing the capacity of national and municipal governments to create jobs in cities ; it would also promote the adoption of innovative approaches to urban job creation .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
In fiscal 1998 the Bank allocated to the social sector US $ 8 , 480-million out of total lending of US $ 28 , 594-million , including US $ 1.9-billion for health , population and nutrition ; US $ 665 million for basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation facilities ; and US $ 3.1-billion for education , placing greater emphasis on primary education for girls , the rural poor and linguistic minorities .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
On behalf of the United Nations , the Centre will lead its partners in a global campaign for secure tenure as one of the fundamental requirements for a process designed to lead to the progressive social integration of the urban poor and the realization of their right to housing .  
The review , with an explicit gender perspective , of existing legislative and administrative frameworks in the context of urban policy reforms , will be required to support the partnership process towards the provision of land , shelter , infrastructure and services at the level of poor urban and rural settlements .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
In the current economic circumstances , as world poverty increased , the threshold got closer and closer to the poverty level instead of reflecting the average distance between rich and poor .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer disproportionately from reproductive ill health .  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
In the early 1990s , the future of UNITAR seemed bleak : heavy debt and financial crisis , total loss of credibility , demotivated staff leaving the organization , poor vision of the future , expensive and often extraneous programmes . 
It is a paradox that some rich countries have such lax laws that they provide safe havens and encourage private banks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons from poor countries by facilitating the establishment of secret accounts .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
The reality shows that the globalization process , based on the international economic relations favourable only for the developed countries , is aggravating poverty in the developing countries and widening disparities between the rich and the poor countries .  
Throughout his adult life Roosevelt Douglas had a singular passionate commitment to the struggle for the liberation of black people everywhere and for the economic and political empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
I represent a friendly and courageous nation that has earned the respect of international public opinion for its steadfast , determined struggle for independence and its defence of the right of small , poor countries to take their place in the world .  
The disease affects everyone poor , rich ; urban , rural ; employee , employer , unemployed ; educated , ignorant ; married , single ; young , old ; resident , tourist .  
The recent slowdown in economic activity , the sharp worsening of foreign reserves and severe contraction of public expenditure on basic services , are inflicting further hardship on the poor .  
Mr . Camdessus stated that the widening gaps between rich and poor within nations , and between the most affluent and most impoverished nations , is morally outrageous , economically wasteful , and potentially socially explosive .  
In order to bring about satisfactory political , social and cultural integration , it was necessary to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in difficult circumstances such as women , children , the poor , displaced persons and refugees .  
Terms like ethnic minority , ethnic conflict , immigration restrictions , new immigrant , illegal alien , urban poor and colourblindness , are used to deny or obscure the racist aspects of certain social behaviours or government policies .  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
This worsening situation is attributed to several factors : the adverse political , economic and social environment between 1993 and 1998 ; poor planning ; inadequate implementation ; and a decrease in the quantity and quality of basic social services .  
Number of ( i ) urban poor communities having access to potable water ; ( ii ) slumupgrading programmes established ; and ( iii ) equitable pricing policies for basic and essential services formulated and implemented .  
Women and children become vulnerable to trafficking because of social inequality and the vast economic disparity within States and between rich and poor States , even though considerable efforts have gone into standardsetting to combat this evil .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter and access to basic services for all , especially the deprived urban and rural poor , through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter and services .  
Enabling policies and programmes at the national and local level are to be implemented that assist the efforts of the private and nongovernmental sectors , and the selfhelp efforts of poor residents in urban and rural areas , to improve shelter conditions .  
The creation of a just , equitable and nondiscriminatory international economic environment that is conducive to social development and sensitive to the needs of the poor is urgently required .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
The initiative to relieve the financial burden of heavily indebted poor countries that was announced in 1996 was revised as an enhanced programme at the G7 Summit held at Cologne in July 1999 .  
The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
Countries in the region are under pressure of varying degrees of economic strain , political instability , deteriorating social conditions and soaring unemployment , affecting not only the traditional poor , but also the middle classes .  
In contrast , a very large poor and indigent population excluded and lacking social cohesion can coexist with privileged professionals who receive benefits from public transfers , such as the armed forces or unionized workers in finance and banking .  
Such solidarity , based on the interdependence of economic , political , cultural and spiritual elements , should inspire the wealthy to feel responsible for the poor and the marginalized and help the weak and the poor to overcome passivity and hopelessness .  
Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor , both within and between countries , is an explicit goal at the national and international levels , as part of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human rights ;  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of nondiscrimination ( art . 2 ) is not fully implemented for children living in the outer islands and in poor urban communities , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The poor of the subregion included the elderly , children , the disabled , smallscale farmers , unskilled workers , the indigenous population and in some countries femaleheaded households , as well as the underemployed and unemployed .  
Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor , both within and between countries , is an explicit goal at the national and international levels , as part of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human rights ;  
That was why the European Union supported the debt cancellation measures for heavily indebted poor countries decided on under the enhanced HIPC initiative , which aimed to cut their debts to a sustainable level .  
Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Timely implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative is fundamental to enabling countries concerned to set aside sufficient resources for poverty reduction and investment in the social sectors .  
Basic human services must not be destroyed ; subsidies and transfers necessary to guarantee humane minimum standards for the poor must be maintained ; and funds needed for sustainable economic recovery must be set aside .  
Strengthening as well as widening and deepening of the financial sector , as one critical area for internationally supported technical assistance , including learning from diverse national experiences in savings mobilization and in the adequate provision of financial services to all segments of society , including women and the poor .  
The Beijing Platform for Action notes that lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health ( para . 
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Scattered among a dozen makeshift camps along the southern border of the Central African Republic , the refugees live in precarious conditions , involving lack of food , poor or inappropriate medical care and lack of medicines and pitiful accommodation .  
For this reason , the International Movement ATD Fourth World wishes to draw attention to the fate of millions of poor children born this year , who , owing to the slowness of the measures being implemented , will be lifelong victims of hunger ; to the millions of boys and girls forever deprived of an elementary education ; to the millions of parents living in roadside huts ; to the millions of fathers seeking work in vain ; and to the millions of mothers robbed of any hope of immediate improvement .  
In his view , the most interesting aspect of the Report was the diagnosis which he summarized in three main points : the poor implementation of some policy prescriptions reflected the impossibility of religiously enforcing conditionality ; social policies in favour of the poor needed to be integrated with macroeconomic policies ; and thirdly , aid effectiveness could be enhanced by improving coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and bilateral donors .  
Female genital mutilation had been banned in many African countries ; policy-makers and healthcare providers in many countries were paying more attention to adolescent reproductive health ; access to health services was being improved for poor rural women and efforts were being made to address the particular vulnerability of women and girl children to the HIV / AIDS epidemic .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
The High Commissioner of Human Rights , closing the seminar , emphasized the need to make the links between human rights and poverty explicit , so that human rights principles would be used both by the poor to know and claim their rights , and by the international community to provide special protection to those in extreme poverty .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of non-discrimination is not fully implemented for non-citizen children , children belonging to minorities , including Roma children , poor or dysfunctional families , children with disabilities and children living in rural areas , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
Many delegations stated that debt reduction should be accelerated for heavily indebted poor countries , in conjunction with effective poverty eradication programmes , and that the enhanced HIPC initiative should be funded through new and additional resources and implemented as soon as possible .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
The conclusion that can be drawn at the present stage is that , despite worldwide awareness of the dangers of a pattern of globalization which , in its current form , constantly widens the gap between rich and poor and contributes to the marginalization of increasing numbers of countries , particularly in Africa , there is still no clear determination in the international community to take decisive action and devote the necessary resources to attain the noble and ambitious goals established by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
The Government , which had been absorbing the bulk of this increase in international prices , was forced to pass it on at the pump . lectricit dHait then doubled its price per kilowatt , leading to a significant increase in production costs in the industrial sector , which was already in poor shape .  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
In designing the orientation of its future work on globalization , ACC recognized the crucial role that the system , collectively , should play to build the knowledge and evidence base required to help develop effective , integrated responses capable of positively influencing globalization processes and their social impact , and of bringing real benefits to the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
Below 500-m3 , the situation becomes critical and between 100 and 200-m3 , the situation is considered a severe water shortage . 38 There is also a considerable inequality in consumption of water between developed and developing countries and over-consumption by the wealthy mirrors the under-consumption of the poor . 
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
To protect the poor in the short run and sustain progress already achieved towards the international development goals , Fund-supported programmes continue to include social safety nets to cushion the negative impact of economic reforms and external shocks on vulnerable groups .  
In addition to continuing with efforts to improve the well-being of the poor , IMF contributes to the monitoring of progress towards international development goals in three ways : disseminating information of growth rates in countries ; reporting the composition of government expenditures with a view to encouraging countries to reduce unproductive expenditures , such as excessive military expenditures ; and tracking trends in social expenditures and social indicators in low-income countries and transition economies .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
The Government of Burkina Faso feels that the positive effects of globalization should be more equitably distributed among nations and that joint efforts should be made to overcome its negative effects , for if globalization were to favour only a minority of States it would be illusory and could lead to future conflicts between rich and poor nations .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
The representative of Haiti said that the increasing gap between rich and poor countries had provoked grave tensions and had been one of the factors behind the increasingly vocal contestation of the anti-globalization movement , and behind the recent tragic events in New York .  
Following meetings with government officials and humanitarian partners and field visits to Bi , Cabinda and Malanje provinces , the Executive Director expressed serious concern about the poor level of education for children and stressed the importance of expanded access and increased government resources for the social sectors .  
He noted the Secretary-Generals recommendation that Governments should be urged to take steps to prepare a transparent , stable and predictable framework for investment and for building institutional infrastructures and that multilateral and bilateral donors should be encouraged to adopt suitable measures to permit faster and more extensive debt relief for poor countries .  
He expressed the hope that the outcomes of the Fourth World Tourism Organization Ministerial Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable Development could provide help to developing countries in their efforts , inter alia , to feed the poor and provide shelter ; halt and reverse the spread of HIV / AIDS ; provide safe drinking water ; and offer employment to the millions of unemployed youth .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
However , the Public Information Office is also faced with a population that has a high illiteracy rate , with inexperienced , inadequate and generally poor local media and with weak or non-existent communications infrastructure outside the capital and two provincial towns .  
Besides poverty reduction , the international community had given specific commitments to ensure that by 2015 boys and girls would have equal access to primary schooling and had also resolved to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters , to reduce child mortality by two thirds , to restrict the spread of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , and to improve the conditions of 100-million urban poor by 2020 .  
Recognizing that the interrelationship of ageing and disability among women needs special attention , since lifelong neglect of womens health , social condition , poor nutrition and hard physical labour leaves them at and after menopause especially vulnerable to the risks of disabilities ,  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Calls for the full , speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , and , in this regard , stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative , hence welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but back to back with meetings for the thirteenth replenishment of the Association , and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process ;  
The international community ought therefore to help poor new democracies like Nepal to accelerate their sustainable economic development and social progress and thus help their quest to consolidate democratic polity , human rights and fundamental freedoms .

The scientific and technological community is convinced that there is already a very wide range of relevant , accessible and often inexpensive technologies and processes available to meet the basic needs of the poor and socially excluded .  
While the Johannesburg agenda was challenging and daunting , it offered a real chance to demonstrate the power of collaboration and to work for the common good , provided that all relevant actors in the United Nations system , Governments , businesses , urban and rural communities , rich and poor countries joined forces to overcome humanitys tremendous challenges and chose the path of sustainable development .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Concerning finance , the Ministers had highlighted the importance of meeting the targets for official development assistance , the need to encourage private sector participation in the promotion of sustainable development through appropriate incentives , ensuring that additional funds were available to the Global Environment Facility , the need for debt relief for highly indebted poor countries , and ensuring market access in developed countries for the exports of developing countries .  
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .  
Creating an efficient environment for and enhancing the effectiveness of social sector investment , including through greater reliance on a participatory local community approach in the design , implementation and evaluation of measures relating to the provision of social infrastructures and basic social services , particularly to improve the condition of the poor members of the community , including through building on deeply embedded traditions of voluntary mutual aid and self-help forms of social capital ;  
The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .  
It marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and North and South , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order . 
During the UN Trade Development Council meeting , representatives of the international organizations and developing nations strongly called for reforming the current international rules and regulations , establishing a just and reasonable international political and economic order , and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor .  At the meeting , Michel Camdessus , managing director of the IMF , urged the rich countries to embrace the poor ones and jointly built a new era of cooperation .  
It is hoped that the declaration and program of action adopted at the meeting will be implemented , that the international community will make progress in reforming the current international rules and regulations and establishing a fair and rational international order , and that contribution will be made to the coordinated development of the economy of all countries and to the narrowing of the gap between the rich and the poor .  
Xiang stated : In 1999 , the Ministry of Finance also organized forces to launch a specialized examination on how specialized funds had been managed or spent , such as funds earmarked for national bonds , funds earmarked as subsidies for key flood control projects , funds earmarked for water conservancy works , and central financial funds earmarked for helping the poor ; adopted punitive measures to deal with exposed problems in a timely fashion ; and made public through the news media a number of typical cases .  
We laid stress on investigating and supervising the use of special funds obtained from national debt , the large amount of central subsidies for flood prevention and water conservancy projects , the extra-budgetary funds of the central finance , central funds for assisting the poor areas , and funds for social security .  We investigated and handled a number of cases of violating financial and economic law , and disciplined those who were involved in such cases .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
People-owned enterprises which got rich ahead of others " thought of the sources for their wealth , " actively made contributions back to society , participated in the activities of supporting the poor , supported the Hope Project , gave donations to assist elderly people who lived alone without help , and performed positive functions in the struggle against floods and other natural disasters and providing relief for people in the disaster-stricken areas .  
Under the guidance of the party Central Committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in Guangxi have built a poor and backward Guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
He stated that " in places with deep-rooted traditional cultures , even if it is extremely poor , there is still the setting sun of the tropics and comfort from stable homes that is inspiring , but the poor in the United States do n't even have these , and they often live irregular lives in which even hope has been stripped away . "  ( See Hong Kong " Ming Pao , " 7 December 1994 . )  
Hu Changqing was a poor boy growing up in a remote hill village .  He became a high-ranking party leader but eventually fell into a deep abyss and violated law and discipline and brought disgrace and ruin upon himself .  The lesson is painful and profound .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
Since the western countries instituted capitalist market economy , pollution , unemployment , and polarization between rich and poor have occurred all the time ; hence their governments have no alternative but to undertake the functions of improving efficiency , regulating income distribution , and stimulating macroeconomic stability and growth .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
The outgoing IMF managing director , Michel Camdessus , said : We have the opportunity to avoid financial crisis and narrow the wide gap between the rich and the poor that " may possibly cause an explosion " so that economic globalization will have human nature in a greater sense .  However , the premise for so doing is that the international economic structure must be commensurate with economic globalization and economic reform plans are widely supported by the populace .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
In view of the situation in which the amphibious warfare vehicles could not move forward under water and the wheeled canons could not land because of the poor geological conditions , such as sludge , and factors , such as waves , currents , shell craters , and ditches , the regiment made use of its existing bridge of boats equipment and set up a floating landing stage , thus enabling the heavy-duty equipment to reach the beach successfully in a forced landing .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
At present , our country 's socialist modernization construction is right in a critical period .  Restructuring state-owned enterprises , helping the poor and storming heavily fortified positions , completing the " Ninth Five-Year " plan , realizing the objective of comfortably well-off , and a series of important issues in the reform and development all need to be studied and resolved .  
Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
The conclusions and requests coming out of the two meetings are diametrically opposed : The resolution of the Group of 77 Ministerial Conference called for changes to the existing irrational economic order , an appeal from the poor countries to the rich ones , while the document drawn up by the G-8 in the meeting in Okinawa involved regulations and requests by the developed countries with regard to the existing world order , and was more like orders issued by the rich countries to the poor ones .  
Among all sorts of comments , however , there is an overwhelming keynote : A crucial standard for judging the success or failure of the G-8 summit is what it has done for the developing regions , especially the poorest regions .  As the gap between poor and rich countries is widening and deepening , the G-8 is facing a grim challenge of the " digital gap " .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed up the global strategic issues into four characters , " east , west , south , and west " .  He also defined the " north-south issue " , which reflects the gap between rich and poor , as a " core issue " .  
In addition , activities for " the great road of peace " , " unimpeded projects " , " mother for aiding the poor " , " be warm , be patriotic " , " outstretched hands " , " linked hearts " , " volunteers " , " public instruction system " , " social service pledge system " , etc . have been launched .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
The founding of new China abolished the reactionary rule of imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucratic capitalism and once and for all put an end to China 's wretched circumstances , a country going downhill , poor , backward , internally divided and externally being trampled upon by the powers .  The Chinese people becamethe masters of the new country , new society .  Erasing the humiliation of a century , the Chinese people stood tall among the ranks of nations .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States has indeed enjoyed nearly 10 years of sustained economic growth , but in respect of citizens ' rights of existence , the gap between rich and poor in American society is growing and the population living in poverty is increasing .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
However , owing to the irrational international economic order that has been formed for a long time , the benefits received by various countries in globalization are very unbalanced , the developing countries are in a relatively disadvantageous position in the process of globalization , and the gap between the poor and the rich and between the South and the North has been further widened .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
He said , through thejoint efforts of the international community , effective international rulesshould be drawn up on the basis of full participation and democraticconsultation by all countries , to ensure that globalization can help to narrowthe disparities between north and south and between rich and poor , help topromote common development , help the developing countries to benefit fromglobalization , and help to promote balanced , steady , and sustainable worldeconomic development .  
Through agreat historical change , China thoroughly terminated its miserable history ofbeing victimized by foreign aggression and becoming weak and poor , and beganthe new process of making the people rich and making the nation strong .  
Our opposition to hegemonism and power politics is precisely for the sake of building a fair and rational new international order of peace and stability , so that all countries large or small , strong or weak , and rich or poor can treat each other as equals and live together in peace .  
The percentage of China 's poverty-stricken population has been lowered to the lowest level in history and the standard of living of the people has been greatly improved .  We have made a leap from being poor to having sufficient food and clothing and another from having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively well-off life .  
In the wake of expanded market access , tariff reduction , and elimination of non-tariff measures , foreign products , services , and investment will enter the Chinese markets en masse , and the domestic enterprises will face even more intense competition .  The township enterprises , in particular , are marked by the inherent poor quality among many of them , as demonstrated by , one , some enterprises ' extensive management mode .  Their environment is filthy , chaotic , and inferior ;  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
Whether they are large or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , all countries should participate in global economic management on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and jointly create and defend a new international economic order that is just and equitable . "  
It may promote economic and social progress , narrow the gap between the rich and the poor , and break down geographical barriers to the market and to prosperity .  But it also may exclude or leave behind those countries that lag in technological innovation and drive them to a even lower level of development . "  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
Article 2 .  When the principal leaders of local people 's governments , or the chief responsible persons of relevant government departments , who , according to the law and administrative regulations , are found to have neglected their duties , or committed misconduct in performing their official duties , or should be held accountable for their poor leadership with respect to preventing the occurrence of the following extraordinarily serious safety incidents shall be disciplined .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
Organizing party and government organizations to help poor people at fixed points is of great significance to cadres ' understanding the national situation , the grassroots level and the people , to raising the cadres ability to solve actual problems , to maintaining close ties between the party and the people and to improving the work style of various offices .  
At this critical moment for carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future , the party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a relevant meeting to summarize past experience and arrange the work for the next 10 years .  The current meeting will certainly have a profound impact on the work of aiding and developing poor areas for the new period .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
The great achievements made by China in supporting and developing poor areas have made important contributions to promoting economic growth , national unity , frontier security , and social stability , and to helping people to live a comfortable life on the whole . 
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
To make the new project of aiding and supporting poor areas successful , we call for continued arduous efforts on the part of the party and the people throughout the country and further support from various social sectors and coastal developed areas .  
While the economic situation on the island is poor and the public eagerly look forward to being lifted out of depression and seeing unemployment mitigated , the Taiwan authorities have found a little " comfort " in the changeable international climate and impatiently jumped on the bandwagon of " containing China " of the international anti-China forces .  
Li Peng said : China pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy and holds that all countries in the world , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal in international affairs .  All countries have the right to select their own social systems and development courses on the basis of their own national conditions .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
The result is that the gap between the poor and the rich has widened , relations between ethnic groups have become tense , and class confrontations have intensified .  No doubt that the middle - and lower-class have been displeased , many people of the upper class , including such moderate of the Republican Party as Jeffords , also have been complaining quite a lot .  
The relevant departments of the State Council should formulate unified fee standards and systems for compulsory education in poor and rural areas .  The standards of fees for textbooks and miscellaneous expenses in other areas should be formulated by provincial people 's governments according to local conditions .  
From the traditional point of view , Chinese products have the advantage of lower prices because of lower production costs .  Despite the fact that today the people have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by improving production quality and services and adding new features , the practice of increasing market share by exporting more low-priced products remains prevalent .  This has prevented Chinese products from ridding themselves of their " poor quality and low price " image .  Moreover , lowering the price often gives others an excuse to file anti-dumping lawsuits .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .  
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
Military schools and academies and military scientific research institutes should use their favorable conditions to pass scientific knowledge to the people in poor areas , transfer scientific and technological achievements to production , spread the use of advanced techniques , help the masses to master science and technology and thus build up their ability to develop the economy .  
The circular points out : Party committees and political organs at all levels should include the work of giving help to poor areas in their work agenda , make well-coordinated and careful arrangements , formulate concrete plans and work measures , and be strict to enhance the comprehensive efficiency in the work of poverty relief and development according to the specific conditions of the local areas where the troops are stationed . 
We have seen clearly that the poor level of productive forces is a major factor that determines people 's willingness in having children .  In view of this , China has worked out its population program and population policies that conform with reality , which have not only successfully ensured healthy development for the country 's population and family planning undertaking ; but has also served to promote the country 's economic growth , push forward social progress , improve the living standards of the people , and enhance the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .

Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
In fact , they are " deadlocks to be resolved . "  While intensifying efforts to publicize the issues of reducing and eliminating poor countries ' debts , the current G-8 summit was unable to implement any new and concrete measures to further reduce and eliminate poor countries ' heavy foreign debts even though $ 53-billion of foreign debts have been accumulatively reduced or exempted from 23 poorest countries in the world .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
A country divided and ravaged by incessant war , corruption in politics , and economic backwardness - - this is the image a chronically poor and weak China projected in the 1930s ; this is also an important reason why Japanese militarists dared to launch a war of aggression against China in a flagrant manner .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
Would they not have ended up just like the Chinese today : poor , backward , ignorant , and rough ? "  When she paid homage to Yasukuni Jinjia herself , she shamelessly said : " I think it was deeply regrettable that Japan was defeated in World War II . In particular , that China became the victor was very unfair and very absurd . "  
Since the Communist Party of China was founded , the Chinese nation has undergone a tremendous change from being poor and backward to thriving and prosperous , from being in a state of broken pieces to unity of a high degree , and from being subjected to bullying and humiliation to standing firm among the nations in the world .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
With a huge amount of funds misappropriated by major shareholders and the parties concerned , a listed company is expected to find itself lacking in reserve strength in seeking development , and entering a strange circle in the end , namely , " outstanding performance in the first year , acceptable performance in the second year , and poor performance in the third year . "  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .

After shutting down nearly 200 various small enterprises which caused serious pollution , Chongqing has also decided to close down another 794 enterprises operated by settlers in the Three Gorges reservoir region which caused serious pollution , which yield poor economic benefits , and which lack economic prospects .  As of now , 16 state , collective , or township and town enterprises , including the Fengjie County Timber Mill have been declared bankrupt or closed .  
The impacts of an economic globalization have proved a major factor that leads to the increasingly widening chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States ; and while new industries , such as the industry of information technology , are reaping in exorbitant profits , the traditional industries of the West , such as the textile industry , are shrinking rapidly .  
Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Regarding the issue of economic globalization , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that the economic globalization has brought about new opportunities of economic development for all countries in the world .

The existing main problems are a low overall standard of product quality , a low ratio of up-to-standard products in a considerable number of categories , the persistent act of producing fake and shoddy products in defiance of repeated bans , and the poor work in supervising and regulating quality .  
Sankei Shimbun published a satirical comic today to mock at the poor showing of Prime Minister Mori at the summit with his frequent slips of tongue .

Countries , whether they are great or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , are all equal members in the international community , should follow the purposes of the " UN Charter " and other norms governing international relations , should mutually respect sovereignty and territorial integrity , should practice non-aggression , should not interfere in each other internal affairs , and should thoroughly discard the Cold War mentality .  
The unjust and irrational old international economic order is a major cause that creates a wide gap between rich and poor .  
During the first half of the year , State Council counsellors focused on the central work of the Party and the government , responding enthusiastically to the call from the CPC Central Committee for the " large-scale development of western China . " Eight separate groups made arduous journeys to the midwestern region - - particularly to frontier areas and poor areas - - to conduct survey studies , writing a number of high-quality research reports and making excellent suggestions , which won the high regard and full affirmation of leading comrades in the State Council .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .

President Jiang Zemin proposed that on the basis of democratic consultation with full participation by the nations , practical international rules should be drawn up to ensure that the process of economic globalization will be able to gain correct guidance and management , advance in the direction of helping to narrow the differences between north and south and rich and poor , and help to promote world economic balance , stability , and sustainable development .  
Grasping those practical issues with which the masses are generally concerned , the autonomous regional government has affirmed ten solid things like effecting long-distance migration to help the poor , bringing air pollution in cities under control , preventing and curing endemic diseases , and so on , and have them vigorously enforced and implemented one by one .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .

He pointed out that China 's national tradition regards " peace as precious , " and even when China becomes powerful in the future , it will always be a major factor and force for world peace ; it is a happy event for the world that China is rich and strong , on the other hand , if China is always poor and backward , that would be a great calamity for the world .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
It has been learned that , despite that poverty relief and development efforts made over the last few years have noticeably alleviated the poverty and backward situations in the vast poor rural areas and noticeably increased incomes of the poverty population , the average income of the poorest population in rural areas is still less than one third of the per capita income of peasants of the country .  Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
Beginning in 2000 , the task will be pressing and arduous to continue to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the low-income populations living in poor rural areas who have not had sufficient food and clothing and those who have initially but not stably had sufficient food and clothing , and for the people living in poverty mainly in old revolutionary areas , minority nationality areas , pastoral areas , frontier areas , and other particularly poor areas ; and the task of preserving the results of poverty relief and development will be as pressing and arduous .  
As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
Two , we must give top priority to case investigation and make breakthroughs in some typical cases of violation of law and discipline , especially cases of trickery to defraud state investments , abuse of official position to engage in graft and corruption , abuse of official power to seek private gains , and cases where dereliction of duty have resulted in poor construction quality that leads to accidents and cases of corruption hidden behind substandard construction work and so on .  We must put a firm grip on these cases and thoroughly investigate them .  
According to interior media reports , Hengdong County of Hengyang City in Hunan is a poor area ; in recent years the state has arranged key construction projects there , including the Dayuandu pivotal water conservancy projects and the Hengdong section of the Beijing-Zhuhai expressway , which have played a big part in local social and economic work .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
It will hear and review special State Council work reports on strengthening the basic position of agriculture and raising farmers ' income , improving the social security system , implementing a moderate monetary policy , curbing counterfeit and poor products , and intensifying the management of the cultural market .  
The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .

The monthly rentals for the premises in the building ( at $ 4 per square foot for ground floor units and at $ 2.5 per square foot for upper floor units exclusive of management charges ) are decided by the Government Property Agency having regard to various relevant considerations , including the short period of availability , the design which is primarily for godown purpose with little ancillary office space , the poor condition , and the market rentals in the vicinity .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
The sceptics will go on to suggest that poor performance of the euro to date , coupled with nationalistic resentment of the imminent loss of one 's own banknotes - to many an emotive symbol of national identity and sovereignty - might yet cause a wave of popular opposition to the euro at the eleventh hour . 
At times when our Sun is active , tremendous explosions known as flares and coronal mass ejections can hurl billions of tonnes of matter into space in one stroke .  These cataclysmic events can trigger magnetic storms on Earth , resulting in poor radio communications or disrupted power grids .  Potential hazards to astronauts or satellites in space can be even more serious .  
According to the quarterly newsletter " I lens " published by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance last month , the general insurance industry registered poor performance in 1999 .

As the unfair and unreasonable international political and economic order has not been fundamentally changed yet , economic globalization has exacerbated the uneven development among countries and regions and widened , in particular , the gap between the North and the South and between the rich and the poor .  
Over the past fifty years , we have had opportunity to witness the achievement of China moving from a poor , awkward , turbulent and fragmented country into a modern , confident and forward looking nation - a nation that has taken her rightful place amongst the community of nations of the world and a nation according to some forecast will become the second largest economy in the world soon . 
The HKSARG affirms the importance of intellectual property protection so as to provide incentives for research and development into new medicines and , at the same time , we recognise that this objective must be balanced with the need to ensure adequate access to existing medicines by rich and poor alike . 
Ideally , the minimum relevant income level should be set at a level high enough to exclude those employees in the lower income bands from contributing so as to alleviate their financial hardship during times when economic conditions are poor .  This level , on the other hand , should not be too high as to drastically reduce in the long run the amount of accrued benefits for retirement .  
" As to poor families in public housing , the Government has put in place all the elements of a comprehensive safety net .  Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .  Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .  
Sergeant Lee Chi-hing said : " With the beat radio remaining the primary means for communication , the Force mobile phone can be used in situations such as poor radio reception , or when lengthy reports or sensitive information needs to be called into the console .  
Soon it was discovered that bamboo was not strong enough to stand continuous beating , so poor and yet talented musicians began to look around , during the 1930 ' s , for metal items that could be beaten to produce a sound , like paint buckets , biscuit tins , garbage bins , and even abandoned car parts .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them .

At present , the Social Welfare Department ( SWD ) provides residential services for people with disabilities and the elderly primarily through financial subventions to non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) .  Amongst these residential services , Long Stay Care Homes are for mentally ill patients with long-term residual disabilities whilst Hostels for Mentally Handicapped Persons are for people with varying degrees of mental handicap .  Residential services for elders suffering from poor health or physical / mental weaknesses are provided in Care and Attention Homes ( including those for the Aged Blind ) and Nursing Homes .  
Because of our economic construction in recent years , the average family income has increased sharply . The general living standard has risen and the gap between the rich and the poor has narrowed .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
In Taiwan , as elsewhere in the world , prisons have historically been dark , dank and dirty places , with poor food , unsanitary conditions , and inmates forced to do hard labor under stern , sometimes cruel supervision .

Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
After September of each year , the northeast seasonal winds are very strong , causing much of the soil to be blown away , and exposing the sandstone layer . In addition to the lack of humus , the soil is extremely poor and barren . Although 55 percent of the island is suitable for planting , yet due to economic inefficiency , mostly peanuts and corn are grown .  
Britain is a prime example . After it became a welfare state in 1945 , the government took on the responsibility of caring for the poor , the handicapped , the sick , and the unemployed from cradle to grave , but a deepening fiscal crisis forced the government to raise taxes during the 1960 ' s .  
Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .  
Changes in internal secretions within the mother 's body during pregnancy are the cause , making it rather easy to develop swelling of the gums . Expectant mothers often have a poor appetite and abnormal eating habits . If they neglect oral hygiene , they may easily develop cavities and inflamed gums . Pain relievers are rarely prescribed to relieve the pain to protect the health of the unborn infant , and consequently the expectant mother has to endure the pain .  
The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them . During the seventeenth century the aborigines still lived by hunting and fishing , and the Han Chinese immigrants were mostly poor farmers and fishermen who left no written records behind , while the historical documents of the Cheng clan ( descendants of the Ming loyalist Koxinga ) were destroyed during the Ching dynasty .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
After World War , Japan was a defeated nation , production stopped , people were poor ; but despite the defeat , occupation , and collapse of the economy , because the bureaucratic system held firm , the government could act smoothly according to established laws and maintain social order and economic production , enabling the nation to quickly recover .

" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
A study of the behavioral problems of gifted children in elementary schools in Taipei found that 50 percent of them had had psychological difficulties such as " I 'd like to do a lot of things but I do n't have the courage , " " I 'm afraid of being put in a poor class in middle school " and " I have a lot of bad habits . "  
As long as 120 years ago , just after it was founded , it treated applicants of all backgrounds just the same - - whether black or white , rich or poor , male or female . It is a citadel of academia that lives up to the ideal of " education without discrimination , " in the words of Confucius .  
In the late 19th century , when colleges on the East Coast were still debating whether to open their doors to the general public , Cornell already accepted students of all backgrounds - - no matter whether they were black or white , rich or poor , male or female , all were treated the same .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
The resistance to illness among children with Down 's is poor , and they easily catch infections . Add to this that many of those with Down 's suffer compound illnesses , with half having congenital heart problems , with others possibly having irregularly shaped intestines , leukemia , abnormal functioning of the thyroid , and other conditions , which can easily be fatal .  
According to a study by the Training and Education Commission of the Ministry of Education , behavioral problems in junior and high school , such as running away from home , skipping school , promiscuous sexual behavior and poor interpersonal relationships are all intimately related to family problems , such as parents and children not getting along or parental absence , divorce or an extramarital affair .  
Since people 's environments ( both natural and social ) are extremely variegated and complex , preventing people from having firsthand knowledge of all of the people , matters and things in the world , sociologists have theorized that people by necessity simplify things , making people who share one characteristic - - such as old people or poor people conform to a single mold .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people . Dr . Lai Yu-chia has just completed a half-year stint on the roving volunteer team .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
Waking from a dream of riches only to be executed , you feel that life is short / Life and death are fated , neither rich nor poor can escape / The seasons change , the sun sets in the west and the water still flows / Where is the general 's horse today , the field is covered with flowers and grass / Life is a lonely boat , day and night the water flows upward / The boat is smashed and repaired / Death brings respite from the affairs of the world .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
Tachen Island is located off the coast of Zhejiang Province . It is a poor and obscure little place whose cuisine is largely limited to seafood . Thus , for example , their " ginger tea noodles " is made with dried fish , shrimp shells , and other seafood fried up with ginger and sesame oil added to the noodles . It 's a special dish that Tachen people give to postpartum mothers to help them regain their strength .  
People who easily have sore hips , shoulders and backs , or who have trouble breathing , poor digestion , prolapse of the rectum , hemorrhoids , unstable blood pressure , a hunched back , a shrunken neck , a protruding lower abdomen , or a large waist , can all use this sitting method .  
Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
In fact the requirements are very broad : people over the age of 65 living on their own - - no matter whether they are weak , lonely , poor or just plain bored - - are all qualified .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
Liang Chiungpai notes that not only do pickled veggies keep well for a long time , they come in many flavors , covering the gamut from sour and salty to sweet and hot ; they also help relieve that bloated feeling . Available to both rich and poor alike , and appropriate for both holidays and ordinary meals , these little appetizers are eminently suited to accompany fine cuisine .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Her main hope now is revise the laws to meet the demands of the times , so that executive agencies can be more efficient . Film is another industry " guided " by the GIO . Though not as complex as the broadcast industry , it has its headaches as well , especially the poor economic returns on domestic films .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
" They are an important reminder to Taiwan 's society to open its eyes and see the poor and the weak among us , " says Li Chia-tung , Dean of Providence University and a one-time volunteer in a Calcutta hospice . He feels that people , especially people who live in self-proclaimed wealthy and civilized countries , love beauty and do their best to avoid seeing ugly and painful things . This even includes many who work in the field of religion .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Juju Wang , an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Tsing Hua University , notes that all of the central government agencies are located up north in Taipei . The city has two-thirds of the island 's universities , over 90 percent of the corporate headquarters , and over 90 percent of its media . The magnetic draw of Taipei has made it an over-loaded city with a deteriorating environment - " a poor place to live amid great wealth . "  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
Recently Cardinal Shan has been promoting the establishment of a Catholic benevolent fund , and the strengthening of service to aboriginal people , foreign workers , the poor and ill , and those in prison . Moreover , the Taiwan Catholic Church is planning a major conference on " New Good News for the New Century , " to be held in 2000 , in the hope of helping Taiwan society as it adjusts to rapid change .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
Just as there are major gaps in outsiders ' understanding of aboriginal culture in general , more detailed research needs to be carried out about the mathematical conceptions of aborigines . This research should be broken down according to age , tribe , area , social situation , and so forth . It 's wrong to make a sweeping generalization and say that " aborigines ' poor performance in math is or is not related to culture , " argues Wang Wei-chang , a photographer who often visits aboriginal communities .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
During a visit by Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan , the local people , exasperated by the effects of two calamities in quick succession , aimed a torrent of invective against the government 's inappropriate planning and poor preventative measures . Some people blamed the flooding on inadequacies in straightening work carried out on downstream sections of the Keelung River , causing flooding further upstream .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
Back when golf was the exclusive domain of the " lofty and rich , " many children from poor families headed to the golf courses to serve as caddies for the wealthy , eventually making reputations themselves among Asia 's few elite professional golfers . Such players as Lu Liang-huan , Hsieh Min-nan , and Chen Chih-chung share similar stories of struggle , from poverty to caddy , and finally to professional golfer .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
When news of the gold rush in Australia reached China in the 1850s , poor farmers , fishermen , and unemployed drifters from Xinning ( today 's Taishan County ) in Guangdong Province , searching for a path of survival or improvement for their families , crossed the sea to Australia . There they settled in places like Adelaide , Bendigo , and Ballarat on the east coast , and in the mountain areas of Queensland state , hoping to fulfill their gold-panning dreams .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
Bringing together rich and poor , male and female , young and old , it forms a many-sided portrait of life in Taipei , divided into four sections : " Car , " " Home , " " Body " and " Feeling . " From the lives of people who consider themselves normal , she uncovers so much that is humorous and twisted .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
The book indicates the positions of " reflex zones " on the feet that correspond to the organs of the urinary , digestive , circulatory and immune systems , and states that the nerve endings in these reflex zones are linked to the major organs of the body . People 's feet spend months and years closed up in " shoe hell , " so that the blood circulation is restricted , and this can easily lead to poor health .  
At present , he is living with his son , and though he is as poor as before , at least the cultural foundation that his friends at home and abroad cooperatively established provides him with a monthly stipend of NT $ 50,000 for his living expenses . He still makes it back to Taiwan on occasion , residing in the quiet flat he rents in Tamsui .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
The Department of Health advises citizens that the most practical preventive measures involve old standbys : careful washing of hands , keeping surroundings clean and well ventilated , avoiding locations that are crowded or have poor ventilation , avoiding unnecessary trips to the doctor or hospital , eating a balanced diet , and getting appropriate amounts of rest and exercise .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory . In recent years he has taken a succession of odd jobs to make ends meet . Currently he is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the children . Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
Li said that China holds that all nations , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal members of the international community China is ready to increase friendly cooperation with Estonia in every area , economic and trade areas in particular  
according to the resolution , the biggest obstacles to the realization of the right to development lie at " the international macro economic level as reflected in the widening gap between the north and the south , the rich and the poor "  
He reiterated that the Chinese government has always adopted an independent foreign policy for peace and held that all countries , no matter they are big or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , should be on an equal footing  
It attributed this alarming decline to a rapid population growth , uneven and poor rainfall patterns , environmental degradation , civil conflicts , an unfavorable international economic environment and inappropriate domestic policies  
In countries where urbanization has taken place at a rapid pace , urban stress affecting human health , particularly that of the urban poor who live in unserviced areas and often make a living from collecting solid wastes , has increased .  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Unfortunately , international economic relations are still marked by the bipolar attitude responsible for the growing gap between rich and poor countries .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
The Fund also supported a wide range of activities to further integrate family planning into primary healthcare networks , improve the quality of existing services and extend integrated MCH / FP services to poor and remote areas .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
In Iraq , hyperinflation has decreased the buying power of the poor and even middle classes as the price of essential commodities has skyrocketed , while the average monthly salary of civil servants has remained stagnant .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter for rapidly growing populations and for the currently deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling and environmentally sustainable approach to shelter development and improvement .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
The plans focused on vulnerable social groups and poor geographical areas , addressing minimum basic needs with the aim of improving the quality of life and expanding the base of the decisionmaking process .  
The Sudanese Government had prepared a comprehensive plan to combat poverty by raising rural living standards through economic and social development plans , with similar projects directed at poor urban dwellers .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
On the political and economic levels , the world continued to be divided into rich countries and poor countries , a polarization which seriously threatened human survival and the maintenance of security and peace .  
Poverty eradication and social and economic policies for standards of living must be based on a recognition of the human dignity of the poor , the weak and the humble .  
To cite one major example , in and around Rwanda the circumstances challenged every aspect of supply operations remote location , poor roads in surrounding countries , meagre local stocks of basic supplies and unprecedented population movements .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , Recalling chapters 7 and 28 of Agenda 21 , dd / adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the main objective of which is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor ,  
Promotion of access to land and security of tenure for all urban residents , in particular the poor , through improved land market transparency and innovative mechanisms to utilize public and private land , including fiscal incentives to bring unutilized land into use , improved land-delivery and land-tenure systems and , where appropriate , direct government and municipal landownership ;  
The Assistant Secretary-General then stated that rural human settlements issues should not be neglected , as the overall situation of the urban and rural poor had become worse , with 40 per cent more people living in absolute poverty compared to 15 years ago .  
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
The timeliness of launching a global movement to ensure prosperity for all in this era of rapid globalization of economic activities was noted at the World Summit for Social Development , held in Copenhagen . In Sri Lanka , the Samurdhi programme is designed to activate the entrepreneurial potential of the poor . 
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
This new framework of solidarity would break with the almost exclusive , dependence on financial inflows from abroad by better exploiting the potential of trade , private investment and access to technology and reforming international financial institutions so as to better integrate them with other parts of the United Nations system and make them better suited to take care of the needs of poor countries in economic and social development .  
The international community has learned from hard experience that initiatives implemented to supply the poor with basic needs have been less than successful when based solely on concerns for welfare , economic growth and income levels .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The resulting problems are , among others , sexually transmitted diseases , including infection with HIV ; early pregnancies ; lack of hygiene and sanitation , leading to infection , infestation and diarrhoea ; genetic and congenital diseases ; psychological and mental diseases ; narcotic and psychotropic drug abuse ; misuse of alcohol and tobacco ; unwarranted risk-taking and destructive activity , resulting in unintentional injuries ; malnutrition ; and poor spacing of births .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .

Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
" Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
The National Working Committee on Children and Women , established under the State Council for monitoring the NPA , will mobilize leaders at key administrative levels to strengthen programme delivery , allocate adequate resources , support local mobilization action and monitor implementation of the NPA . 59 .  In poor counties and ethnic minority areas , empowerment activities will be adapted to the local culture , knowledge and needs .  
Such services must be adapted to specific socio-cultural contexts ; be extended to poor women , minorities , unmarried women and adolescents ; promote healthy and responsible reproductive behaviour ; pay special attention to young adults and men ; and promote the use of condoms and other barrier methods of contraception .  
They considered educative measures and publicity as most important to curb the level of violence against women and asked whether particular programmes existed to deal with the problem of violence against particularly marginalized groups , such as refugee , poor and disabled women .  In reply to further questions , the representatives stated that assault and battery , whether committed inside or outside the home , could be prosecuted without the consent of the victim .  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
Many non-governmental organizations feel that progress could be faster , pointing to continued forest damage and the apparently low levels of grass-roots involvement , and calling for the implementation of the FAO Peasants Charter to correct skewed land ownership or access patterns , which concentrate human pressure on the few forests that are accessible to the poor , thereby contributing to their degradation and loss .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .  
This has been a critical step forward in the context of translating project-induced increases in agricultural productivity and often a strengthened resource base into adequate diets for rural poor households .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
With rising incomes the poor should be able to afford rudimentary but satisfactory sanitation facilities with some technical advice on sewage disposal facilities from the Government , but it will remain the responsibility of the Government to provide basic health care and safe drinking water facilities to the poor wherever they are located .  
The urban poor are the primary victims of municipal sewage discharged into water bodies and the improper disposal of solid waste and toxic chemicals .  
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The objective is to assist the large numbers of the homeless and those living in poor shelter and unhealthy neighbourhoods , whether in urban slums and squatter areas or in poor rural areas , to meet their housing needs .  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
Noting with concern situations of extreme violence , such as those rooted in terrorism and its concomitant , international drug trafficking , which have brought about major changes in the survival strategies of poor rural families , prompting their forced displacement from their places of origin and rendering even more critical the situation of the women who then become the core of the nuclear family ,  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of any social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
It was agreed that the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in particular input subsidies , needed careful examination , with special attention being paid to distributive problems , especially that of the negative impact on the poor .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy and numeric problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .  SFD executes six programmes , dealing with public works , community development , enterprise development , employment and retraining , institutional development and public transport .  
It has required , for example , that UNDP continue to adjust and focus its programmes in the countries it serves , shifting its work upstream to broad policies and programmes , reducing the proliferation of isolated projects and addressing difficult goals such as providing the poor with decent jobs and even difficult concepts like good governance and implementation capacity . 
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
Although they said that the main focus of UNICEF should continue to be in rural areas , several delegations stressed the need for UNICEF to emphasize poor populations living in such environmentally vulnerable areas as slums and marginal urban pockets .  
Weak economic and accounting data systems , poor tender procedures , secrecy of budget documents and deficient mass media were identified as the main explanatory factors .  
These internally displaced persons have suffered the hardships typical of other refugees and internally displaced persons : they were forced to flee their homes and established community structures at very short notice , unaware of where they were going or how they would end up and having to endure temporary shelter and extremely poor living conditions .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .  Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .

Rigid social and cultural norms and lack of sharing of domestic responsibilities exacerbate the problems women face when operating businesses .  
A special initiative entitled " Intensified cooperation with countries and peoples in greatest need " aims to enable poor countries to establish equitable and sustainable health systems tailored to their specific needs .  
Second , the strategy to be pursued must be based on growth with equity , the full participation of all actors in development , including civil society , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the poor themselves , and should involve a decentralized approach in which decisions and resources allocation can be made at the local level , taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the target groups or areas .  
Such emphasis on women is warranted since women , who compose more than half of the world 's poor , often face special legal and social obstructions in carrying out business and economic activities , despite their record of being responsible entrepreneurs and the principal contributors to the welfare of the family .  
Taiwan sought recognition of its right to international representation on equal terms as those enjoyed by other countries so that it could be a constructive voice within the United Nations , cooperate in programmes for the economic and social development of poor countries , and seek solutions to the current United Nations economic crisis , which had repercussions for Taiwan as well .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Another institution with a direct bearing on the process of reconstruction and improving the living conditions of poor groups is the Social Investment Fund , which channels assistance to poor sectors of the population , including those uprooted by the conflict , thereby meeting the dual objective of combating poverty and strengthening the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
They were confident that their standard of living was improving , that their poor would soon be employed , that their children would become better educated , and that they would be taken seriously as economic actors on the world stage .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
Preschool institutions , homes for children deprived of parental care , disabled children and youth institutions for juvenile delinquents , are also in an increasingly difficult material situation , manifested by a poor quality of food and a considerable decline of standards , including poor hygienic standards , insufficient heating , inadequate maintenance , the impossibility to keep facilities and equipment in proper repair .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
In India , programmes to guarantee employment to the rural poor and unemployed youth , meet the nutritional , educational and health needs of women and promote their empowerment , and mass literacy programmes were central to the realization of situation-specific strategies .  
it was the economic and social marginalization of poor countries which deprived children of the right to realize their physical and intellectual potential , complete their education , find work and become well-adjusted , economically productive and socially responsible adults .  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
obstacles remained , however : harsh economic conditions , the building and expansion of Israeli settlements , the isolation and closure of areas of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and land and water confiscation all had a detrimental effect on the situation of Palestinian women and children , who were already suffering from the disastrous consequences of long years of occupation ( rising numbers of refugees and displaced persons , break-up of families , deterioration of health conditions , poor education , rising unemployment and depletion of the environment ) .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
We should be happy to do so without repeating any of the recent tired , uncharitable and inaccurate nostrums about the death of the obligation to accord economic preferences to poor countries , even as we clamour that human rights and humanitarianism have now been elevated to a place of honour in the international pantheon .  
All these falsities , many of them recorded in United Nations documents , hide the bankruptcy of development prospects for most of the poor countries , which is already threatening world stability and aggravating the ecological deterioration we all recognized several years ago at the historic Rio Conference .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
The United Nations was established 51 years ago with a focus on the maintenance of peace and security , and while that remains the objective , the linkage between peace and economic and social development , enshrined in the Charter , must be recognized and strengthened if the world is to escape the inexorable consequences of the continuously widening gap between rich and poor nations .  
We believe that the main focus for the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our society . 
In response to our d \ x { 5e66 } arche , the Secretary-General informed us that he had submitted to the executive heads of the specialized agencies a series of proposals for the establishment of inter-agency task forces aimed at providing strong coordinated support for country-level action , in the areas of the extension of basic social services , access by the poor to productive assets and employment and the creation of an enabling environment for poverty eradication and social development . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
Though aware of the precarious security situation and the poor condition of the infrastructure in Goma and the consequent need for official government assistance , the Commission considered that the insistence of Zairian officials on attending all its interviews was obstructive , unhelpful and not in keeping with the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1013 ( 1995 ) , and especially paragraphs 5 ( a ) and ( e ) thereof . 
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
However , administered or indicative maximum or minimum prices still exist in many countries of the region for selected agricultural exports or basic foodstuffs with the rationale of protecting the interests of the small farmers and the poor .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
In addition , prenatal exposure to illicit drugs and factors such as premature birth , low birth weight and poor relations between the child and care-giver in early childhood have been identified as problematic in relation to later development and , consequently , as precursors of the risk factors listed in the table above .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Conduct thematic studies to evaluate poverty alleviation strategies , especially with reference to women workers in the informal sector - on such themes as poverty , household food security and gender , focusing on the feminization of poverty as expressed in food insecurity ; conduct studies with respect to adapting successful credit systems in different socio-cultural areas , with particular emphasis on the needs of poor rural women , and to integrating information on credit systems into non-formal education ; undertake case-studies on the role of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Many poverty-stricken low latitude countries with rapid population growth , high illiteracy and large deficiencies in terms of trained manpower suffer from a complex water scarcity , in the form of particularly problematic environmental conditions with which they must cope , such as monsoon climates , erratic rainfall and poor soils . 
These include unwanted and unsafe sex ( giving rise to teenage pregnancy , HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases ) ; psychoactive substance use , including tobacco and alcohol ; violence and accidents ; and poor nutrition and certain common endemic diseases .  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
The main focus of the 20 / 20 initiative should be the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable segments of the populations .  
In terms of the poor penetration of agricultural areas that required specialized types of services , the Working Group stated that opportunities existed to provide alternative services such as radio communication systems , space or ground based .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
ESCAP has prepared and disseminated a publication on enhancing the role of non-governmental organizations in implementing the regional Agenda for Action ; convened a regional workshop on guidelines for implementing the Agenda ; held an expert group meeting on the enhancement of social security for the poor ; and a meeting of senior officials on a policy framework for lifelong preparation for old age .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
We must note with deep concern the delays , particularly in the areas of the quartering of UNITA troops ; the selection of soldiers for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces ( FAA ) ; and the slow process of the transfer of UNITA commanding officers to join the FAA , as well as the handing over to UNAVEM III of insufficient quantities of weapons and the poor quality of those handed over , and the continued presence of UNITA police .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled " Macroeconomic policy questions " ;  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .  
The key factors which contribute to inefficient energy-use in the transport sector are growing road congestion in urban areas , increasing dependence on cars , and use of vehicles which are not fuel efficient coupled with poor vehicle and road maintenance in developing countries .  
Welcomes the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative endorsed by the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund and the Development Committee of the World Bank , designed to enable eligible heavily indebted poor countries to achieve a sustainable debt situation through coordinated action by all creditors on the basis of adjustment efforts by the debtor countries necessary to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
However , the initiative fell short of the expectations of the heavily indebted poor countries in three respects : the debt sustainability criteria were still restrictive ; appropriate flexibility was needed in determining country eligibility ; and a more realistic time _ frame for eligibility should be offered .  
Indonesia 's experience illustrated the region 's rapid transition from an economy where , just over a quarter of a century ago , 60 per cent of its population had been classified as poor to one where an annual average growth of 7 per cent had been sustained over two decades , and where the incidence of absolute poverty now affected less than 14 per cent of the total population .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled ' Macroeconomic policy questions ' ;  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
All countries should increase their mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field , eliminate unequal practices in trade and economic relations , and do away with discriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
As part of the follow-up to the Social Summit , Governments have reported a variety of actions towards the eradication of poverty : adopting national targets for poverty reduction ; promoting job creation and growth ; maintaining effective safety nets , including comprehensive social security , universal health care and education services ; providing adequate housing ; enhancing social integration of the poor ; and undertaking studies and surveys to improve national information on poverty .  
However , recent outbreaks of cholera in Peru and a " plague scare " in India ( see box 4 ) have clearly demonstrated the human suffering and loss of life that may result from poor waste management and the disastrous effect that waste-related diseases may have on the trade and tourism vital for national economy .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Indian society is marked by a rigid hierarchical social stratification which divides the country into two nations : the one comprising the majority , who are poor , uneducated and illiterate , particularly in rural areas , and the other , consisting of the minority which holds the reins of power and forms the economic , social and cultural \ x { 5e68 } ite .  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
The Conference welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and hoped that it would be reinforced by additional bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce the debt stock of all African countries .  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
The result was unrealistic national economic and fiscal policy-making , compounded by the poor administrative capacity of many governments to collect revenues .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
The Government with its various structures has found itself unable to ensure systemwide and effective management of the economic and social processes and proper implementation of the reforms ; its has displayed poor initiative and spent its time largely " putting out fires " .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing , a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , the sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
Targeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of society children , women , the elderly , the disadvantaged , the poor , the disabled is , moreover , a prerequisite for the successful realization of social justice , equity and respect for human dignity .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival . 
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
Global Knowledge 97 will address a fundamental challenge facing developing countries and the international development community in the information age : given the vital role of knowledge in economic and social development , how can developing countries , and in particular the worlds poor , harness knowledge for development , participate in the global information economy and gain access to new tools for life-long learning ?  
In the health sector , United Nations observers regularly report an exceptionally serious deterioration in the health infrastructure : a high infant mortality rate and high rates of morbidity and mortality in general , poor and inadequate storage conditions for supplies , an unreliable supply of electricity and back-up generators , faulty or non-functioning air-conditioning , defective cold-storage , interrupted water supplies , broken / leaking sewage systems and non-functioning hospital waste disposal systems .  
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women and specifically address the special needs of girls and women as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents , rural and urban poor , persons in remote or neglected areas , and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " . 
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
The Metro Manila city and town mayors have agreed to pursue a common resettlement site for their respective urban poor constituents who need to be relocated because they are occupying dangerous zones and critical areas for government infrastructure projects .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .  
History has shown that the huge present-day inequalities between developed and poor countries are the result of centuries of plundering and exploitation during which civilizations , social structures and indigenous modes of production were destroyed and during which the ecosystems of Africa , America and Asia were pillaged .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Gender discrimination was often practised against specific social groups , such as migrant workers , especially undocumented " illegal " workers coming from " poor " countries , including indigenous women .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
The Bretton Woods institutions had made a major step in that direction by endorsing the action programme of the initiative to reduce the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries ; under that initiative the three main groups of creditor countries had confirmed that they would take coordinated , simultaneous , but independent action , and would share the costs equitably ; they had also accepted a flexible structure and a case-by-case approach to take into account the characteristics of the economies of the heavily indebted poor countries .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
We want it to be a strong , principled and effective body , the common inheritance of all mankind , not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States , but the guardian of all , especially the poor , the weak and the defenceless . 
Breakdowns in public health as a result of insufficient coverage and the poor operation and maintenance of existing water supply systems are now frequent , though rarely reported until spectacular rates of epidemiological transmission occur .  
Incineration , mainly of medical waste and combustible hazardous materials , has been practised widely in the region , but , it has not generally been efficient because of poor maintenance of plants , manpower shortage and improper choice of facilities .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
At the national level , numerous charitable organizations and benevolent societies provided medical and material assistance to the poor and needy .  
During their extended phase , all current projects would continue to address several common themes and issues critical to enhancing impact at the grass-roots level and improving the living conditions of poor and disadvantaged people .  
Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have " dualistic economies " , with the existence of great disparities between rich and poor , urban and rural areas , and central and peripheral geographic zones .  
They are located in fragile ecosystems and have been subject to strong degradation for many years , owing to environmental stress ( arid climate , poor soils , strong erosion , overgrazing and demographic expansion ) .  
Particularly in the social field , advisory services and group training proved to be the most effective means to reach local governments and grass-roots people , including the urban and rural poor , women , children , youth , the aged and the handicapped .  
BAHAMONDES ( Canada ) said that the efforts of the United Nations to eradicate poverty constituted both a moral imperative and a collective undertaking with a direct bearing on the interests of all countries , rich and poor alike .  
One of the major objectives of the camp was to upgrade trainers skills in adapting existing training materials and designing new ones to meet the needs of various target groups in urban and rural areas , with emphasis on the poor .  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
If there is no determined international concerted effort to eradicate poverty and to improve the quality of life of the poor , then we will have the classical scenario of poverty breeding environmental decay .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
This relates to the complex question of international and national transfers to internalize positive externalities by supporting forest-based sustainable livelihoods of the rural poor .  
With the withdrawal of the State from direct provision of housing or housing subsidies to the poor and the deregulation of the rental market , the poor are exploited by private property owners , often paying over half of their meagre income on rent .  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
At regional higher educational establishments which , like Jalal _ Abad University , were set up simply by combining a number of technical secondary schools and without the requisite teaching materials , equipment , premises or qualified teaching staff , the quality of instruction is poor .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
It has been aggravated by a number of negative social phenomena , such as the deterioration in the health of poor people due to poor nutrition , school leaving caused by a disruption in the normal functioning of educational and cultural establishments , and an increase in crime , and in the moral decay of adults , resulting in more and various forms of violence .  
Social care benefits and pensions are directed to the disabled , lonely elderly , invalids , the poor , families with four or more children , the unemployed , and those with an income providing less than the established minimum standard of living .  
Being cognizant of the importance of focusing upon the family , which is the primary unit of any society , and on economic entities in the fight against poverty , the Government orients its activities towards changing the current inert status of poor families living below the poverty line , as mere recipients of aid .  
Governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with women , youth and children carry out many activities aimed not only at preserving humane traditions practised in Mongolian families and inherited from our ancestors , including reverence and care of parents , support for the poor , and respect for elderly and pregnant women , but also at enriching them in new settings and passing them on to future generations . 
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
The programme is aimed at poor families living in minimal housing conditions and in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archaeological reserves or on private property , persons over 18 years of age , and persons who belong to a family unit with an income of less than two monthly minimum wages when they can prove that the family has no assets and have expressed a desire to purchase a plot . 
The bail-out strategies resorted to when a crisis occurred were becoming increasingly problematic : they protected creditors from bearing the responsibility of poor decisions , placing the burden entirely on debtors , tended to encourage imprudent lending practices on the part of international lenders and required such a huge amount of funding that they were reaching the limits of political acceptability .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
In order to reverse that trend , it was essential to demonstrate to donor Governments that development assistance was fruitful : that it led to tangible improvements for the poor and was not wasted in bureaucratic tangles or by improper practices or misconduct .  
It should be borne in mind that the current situation of millions of children in many parts of the world remained critical as a result of poor economic and social conditions , poverty , armed conflicts , the exploitation of child labour and the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , and that the number of children infected with HIV / AIDS had risen at an alarming rate .  
The aims of Covenant House are : to identify and attempt to assist in solving the problems of the urban poor , especially abandoned or neglected children ; to explore and participate in the identification of the social , psychological and physical problems of these children ; and to stimulate public awareness of the need for effective youth-care facilities .  
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
The executive heads of organizations in the United Nations system outlined the elements of a shared strategy and committed themselves to the concerted effort by all agencies towards poverty eradication and also to playing a supportive and catalytic role in mobilizing the energies and resources of all development actors Governments , the private sector , civil society , donors and above all the poor themselves in the campaign against poverty .  
These are particularly difficult times for the families of mineworkers and industrial workers who have no revenues from the land ( poverty ratio of 44.33 per cent ) , poor urban families with a large number of children , families with mentally or physically handicapped members , adults or elderly persons without relatives unable to fend for themselves , pensioners with a minimum pension , urban families who have provided shelter to refugee families from war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia , etc .  
Reasons for this unsustainable pattern of development in the ESCWA region include poor institutional arrangements , deficiency in environmental , economic and social information , a lack of public participation in the decision-making process , and severe inadequacy in institutional capacities and qualified human resources .  
In the Asia and the Pacific region , while continuing its important partnership with the Governments of each country , UNDP formed strategic partnerships with civil society organizations , NGOs , women 's groups , trade organizations , the private sector , advocates for the environment and against child labour , politicians , parliamentarians , and poor urban and rural slum communities themselves .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ; special issues of least developed countries / Africa / heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
While non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) were a driving force for social development , the steady increase in poverty among the hard core poor and the growing disparity in levels of consumption indicated that the poorest sectors could be better addressed by community-based organizations capable of developing innovative programmes that took into account the non-static characteristics of poverty .  
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .

Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
If providing food to poor families in all parts of the country is given equal value in a financially expensive programme of food security , the female children in backward villages may continue to be deprived , if social reforms are not pursued effectively . most vulnerable . 
It is because they recognize that , " in an unequal society , the families below the poverty line are doomed to remain poor in absolute as well as relative terms " , that some countries have resorted to affirmative action , equal opportunity laws and other pro-active measures to correct gross disparities at the start . 
While recognizing the efforts made by the State party in the area of education , the Committee remains concerned at the high drop _ out rate for males in the upper grades of primary school , the poor reading ability or primary school males , the high incidence of truancy , lack of relevant learning material , insufficient numbers of trained and qualified teachers , and the tendency towards teaching methods that are almost exclusively exam oriented .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .  
As experienced by some developing countries , the calculated product-specific AMS of a market price support measure could become a negative figure when the administered market price dropped below the ERP nominally fixed to the world price in the 1986-1988 base period to meet the objective of supporting food purchases by poor households . 
" The aggression , which deprived millions of sick and poor people of their right to affordable treatment , constituted a flagrant violation of the Sudan 's sovereignty and territories and a stark violation of all international norms , laws and charters , including the Charter of the United Nations Organization .  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
The meeting also identified a number of constraints in the development of microcredit programmes , including the lack of reliable sources of finance , especially at the start of a programme ; difficulty of determining appropriate interest rates on loans for the poor ; lack of an enabling environment due to unfavourable government regulatory systems ; and hostile banking sectors and lack of support for training institutions .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
The positive effects of air transport on the immediate living conditions of the very poor can readily be seen in the emergency distribution of essential foods , medicines and other commodities , and in the transport of health and social workers to remote locations where traditional means of transport are often impractical or impossible .  
According to the first African Competitiveness Report , published by the World Economic Forum in 1998 , the most important problematic factors for doing business in sub-Saharan Africa are , inter alia , ( a ) tax regulation regimes , ( b ) difficulties in raising local financing , ( c ) weak infrastructure and ( d ) poor economic governance .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes and promotes equitable income distribution for the eradication of poverty ;  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
While welcoming the recent developments in connection with the enhanced heavily indebted poor country ( HIPC ) initiative arising from the Cologne Summit , faster and deeper debt relief is required in order to enable African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
Those overall trends masked the serious debt problems faced by the heavily indebted poor countries and the fact that a growing number of middle-income developing countries had experienced serious payments problems , aggravated by the contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis ( A / 54 / 370 , paras . 3 to 5 ) .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
Human-centred development , the concept outlined at Copenhagen , would enable the poor to enjoy basic political and economic freedoms while focusing on practical and effective ways of alleviating their suffering .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .

It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
In order to ensure that the benefits of globalization were enjoyed by all countries , rich and poor , it was essential to adopt and promote a multilateral approach by reshaping the current structure of the existing international institutions and their regulatory mechanisms . 
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Mr . Aujali ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that he associated himself with the statement made by the representative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and that the United Nations was aware of the harmful effects of debt , which had slowed the economic and social development of the heavily indebted poor countries , leaving them unable to meet the basic social needs of their people .  Those most affected by that situation were children , women and older persons .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
I call upon every Member State , large and small , developed and developing , rich and poor , to work cooperatively to find meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this growing international problem and challenge .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
However , we can not fail to point out that this benefit will not come to everyone equally ; nor can we accept passively the idea that the great majority of people in underdeveloped countries are doomed by massive , dire poverty , hunger , poor health and malnutrition not to be a part of these optimistic statistics but , rather , to be included in the morbidity and mortality statistics characteristic of the less developed regions of the world .  
In this respect , Tunisia calls for international solidarity so as to put an end to the existing disparities between the rich and poor countries , between those with sufficient resources to provide their citizens with a happy old age and enough to live on , and those whose meagre resources are insufficient to meet adequately the many needs of their people , especially the elderly .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
Since then , Egypt has embarked upon reforming its economy and has implemented structural adjustment programmes to achieve economic growth aimed at improving the living standards of the Egyptian people while establishing social safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable groups of our society .  
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
Even if it is established that primary responsibility for the implementation of existing international commitments belongs to national Governments , it is important to stress the irreplaceable role of the United Nations and of the whole international community in the mobilization of resources and support for the national efforts of poor and deprived countries .  
We are providing social care for the elderly , orphans , the disabled and poor families , as well as special care for the people of rural areas , including economic and social necessities aimed at limiting urban migration .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
Encourages non-governmental organizations , private funding institutions and individual donors to organize and support assistance programmes and missions tailored to the needs of areas where psychological psychiatric problems are prevalent among the population , in particular among poor urban and rural women , with a view to providing not only primary treatment but also training for family members and or other persons who may take over the care of the afflicted persons ;  
The urban poor , especially women and children , are forced to live in makeshift shelters in appalling and degrading conditions presenting hazards for both physical and mental health .  
From the point of view of labour rights , globalization was encouraging fragmentation and uncertainty ; as TNCs escaped national accountability , the poor were becoming increasingly disenfranchised , subsidies formerly granted to labour were being redirected to attract international capital , and the burden of taxes was shifting increasingly from capital to labour .  
In the context of its contribution to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , ILO was currently developing an urban employment programme focused on more and better jobs in the informal sector aimed , among other things , at improving the living and working environment in poor urban neighbourhoods and increasing the capacity of national and municipal governments to create jobs in cities ; it would also promote the adoption of innovative approaches to urban job creation .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
In fiscal 1998 the Bank allocated to the social sector US $ 8 , 480-million out of total lending of US $ 28 , 594-million , including US $ 1.9-billion for health , population and nutrition ; US $ 665 million for basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation facilities ; and US $ 3.1-billion for education , placing greater emphasis on primary education for girls , the rural poor and linguistic minorities .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
On behalf of the United Nations , the Centre will lead its partners in a global campaign for secure tenure as one of the fundamental requirements for a process designed to lead to the progressive social integration of the urban poor and the realization of their right to housing .  
The review , with an explicit gender perspective , of existing legislative and administrative frameworks in the context of urban policy reforms , will be required to support the partnership process towards the provision of land , shelter , infrastructure and services at the level of poor urban and rural settlements .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
In the current economic circumstances , as world poverty increased , the threshold got closer and closer to the poverty level instead of reflecting the average distance between rich and poor .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer disproportionately from reproductive ill health .  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role , in the eradication of poverty , of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
In the early 1990s , the future of UNITAR seemed bleak : heavy debt and financial crisis , total loss of credibility , demotivated staff leaving the organization , poor vision of the future , expensive and often extraneous programmes . 
It is a paradox that some rich countries have such lax laws that they provide safe havens and encourage private banks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons from poor countries by facilitating the establishment of secret accounts .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
The reality shows that the globalization process , based on the international economic relations favourable only for the developed countries , is aggravating poverty in the developing countries and widening disparities between the rich and the poor countries .  
Throughout his adult life Roosevelt Douglas had a singular passionate commitment to the struggle for the liberation of black people everywhere and for the economic and political empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
I represent a friendly and courageous nation that has earned the respect of international public opinion for its steadfast , determined struggle for independence and its defence of the right of small , poor countries to take their place in the world .  
The disease affects everyone poor , rich ; urban , rural ; employee , employer , unemployed ; educated , ignorant ; married , single ; young , old ; resident , tourist .  
The recent slowdown in economic activity , the sharp worsening of foreign reserves and severe contraction of public expenditure on basic services , are inflicting further hardship on the poor .  
Mr . Camdessus stated that the widening gaps between rich and poor within nations , and between the most affluent and most impoverished nations , is morally outrageous , economically wasteful , and potentially socially explosive .  
In order to bring about satisfactory political , social and cultural integration , it was necessary to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in difficult circumstances such as women , children , the poor , displaced persons and refugees .  
Terms like ethnic minority , ethnic conflict , immigration restrictions , new immigrant , illegal alien , urban poor and colourblindness , are used to deny or obscure the racist aspects of certain social behaviours or government policies .  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
This worsening situation is attributed to several factors : the adverse political , economic and social environment between 1993 and 1998 ; poor planning ; inadequate implementation ; and a decrease in the quantity and quality of basic social services .  
Number of ( i ) urban poor communities having access to potable water ; ( ii ) slumupgrading programmes established ; and ( iii ) equitable pricing policies for basic and essential services formulated and implemented .  
Women and children become vulnerable to trafficking because of social inequality and the vast economic disparity within States and between rich and poor States , even though considerable efforts have gone into standardsetting to combat this evil .  
In conclusion , the representative emphasized Indias determined , concrete and sustained efforts to eliminate poverty and social disability and empower the poor and vulnerable .  
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter and access to basic services for all , especially the deprived urban and rural poor , through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter and services .  
Enabling policies and programmes at the national and local level are to be implemented that assist the efforts of the private and nongovernmental sectors , and the selfhelp efforts of poor residents in urban and rural areas , to improve shelter conditions .  
The creation of a just , equitable and nondiscriminatory international economic environment that is conducive to social development and sensitive to the needs of the poor is urgently required .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
The initiative to relieve the financial burden of heavily indebted poor countries that was announced in 1996 was revised as an enhanced programme at the G7 Summit held at Cologne in July 1999 .  
The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
Countries in the region are under pressure of varying degrees of economic strain , political instability , deteriorating social conditions and soaring unemployment , affecting not only the traditional poor , but also the middle classes .  
In contrast , a very large poor and indigent population excluded and lacking social cohesion can coexist with privileged professionals who receive benefits from public transfers , such as the armed forces or unionized workers in finance and banking .  
Such solidarity , based on the interdependence of economic , political , cultural and spiritual elements , should inspire the wealthy to feel responsible for the poor and the marginalized and help the weak and the poor to overcome passivity and hopelessness .  
Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor , both within and between countries , is an explicit goal at the national and international levels , as part of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human rights ;  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of nondiscrimination ( art . 2 ) is not fully implemented for children living in the outer islands and in poor urban communities , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The poor of the subregion included the elderly , children , the disabled , smallscale farmers , unskilled workers , the indigenous population and in some countries femaleheaded households , as well as the underemployed and unemployed .  
Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor , both within and between countries , is an explicit goal at the national and international levels , as part of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human rights ;  
That was why the European Union supported the debt cancellation measures for heavily indebted poor countries decided on under the enhanced HIPC initiative , which aimed to cut their debts to a sustainable level .  
Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Timely implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative is fundamental to enabling countries concerned to set aside sufficient resources for poverty reduction and investment in the social sectors .  
Basic human services must not be destroyed ; subsidies and transfers necessary to guarantee humane minimum standards for the poor must be maintained ; and funds needed for sustainable economic recovery must be set aside .  
Strengthening as well as widening and deepening of the financial sector , as one critical area for internationally supported technical assistance , including learning from diverse national experiences in savings mobilization and in the adequate provision of financial services to all segments of society , including women and the poor .  
The Beijing Platform for Action notes that lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health ( para . 
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Scattered among a dozen makeshift camps along the southern border of the Central African Republic , the refugees live in precarious conditions , involving lack of food , poor or inappropriate medical care and lack of medicines and pitiful accommodation .  
For this reason , the International Movement ATD Fourth World wishes to draw attention to the fate of millions of poor children born this year , who , owing to the slowness of the measures being implemented , will be lifelong victims of hunger ; to the millions of boys and girls forever deprived of an elementary education ; to the millions of parents living in roadside huts ; to the millions of fathers seeking work in vain ; and to the millions of mothers robbed of any hope of immediate improvement .  
In his view , the most interesting aspect of the Report was the diagnosis which he summarized in three main points : the poor implementation of some policy prescriptions reflected the impossibility of religiously enforcing conditionality ; social policies in favour of the poor needed to be integrated with macroeconomic policies ; and thirdly , aid effectiveness could be enhanced by improving coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and bilateral donors .  
Female genital mutilation had been banned in many African countries ; policy-makers and healthcare providers in many countries were paying more attention to adolescent reproductive health ; access to health services was being improved for poor rural women and efforts were being made to address the particular vulnerability of women and girl children to the HIV / AIDS epidemic .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
The High Commissioner of Human Rights , closing the seminar , emphasized the need to make the links between human rights and poverty explicit , so that human rights principles would be used both by the poor to know and claim their rights , and by the international community to provide special protection to those in extreme poverty .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of non-discrimination is not fully implemented for non-citizen children , children belonging to minorities , including Roma children , poor or dysfunctional families , children with disabilities and children living in rural areas , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
Many delegations stated that debt reduction should be accelerated for heavily indebted poor countries , in conjunction with effective poverty eradication programmes , and that the enhanced HIPC initiative should be funded through new and additional resources and implemented as soon as possible .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
The conclusion that can be drawn at the present stage is that , despite worldwide awareness of the dangers of a pattern of globalization which , in its current form , constantly widens the gap between rich and poor and contributes to the marginalization of increasing numbers of countries , particularly in Africa , there is still no clear determination in the international community to take decisive action and devote the necessary resources to attain the noble and ambitious goals established by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
The Government , which had been absorbing the bulk of this increase in international prices , was forced to pass it on at the pump . lectricit dHait then doubled its price per kilowatt , leading to a significant increase in production costs in the industrial sector , which was already in poor shape .  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
In designing the orientation of its future work on globalization , ACC recognized the crucial role that the system , collectively , should play to build the knowledge and evidence base required to help develop effective , integrated responses capable of positively influencing globalization processes and their social impact , and of bringing real benefits to the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
Below 500-m3 , the situation becomes critical and between 100 and 200-m3 , the situation is considered a severe water shortage . 38 There is also a considerable inequality in consumption of water between developed and developing countries and over-consumption by the wealthy mirrors the under-consumption of the poor . 
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
To protect the poor in the short run and sustain progress already achieved towards the international development goals , Fund-supported programmes continue to include social safety nets to cushion the negative impact of economic reforms and external shocks on vulnerable groups .  
In addition to continuing with efforts to improve the well-being of the poor , IMF contributes to the monitoring of progress towards international development goals in three ways : disseminating information of growth rates in countries ; reporting the composition of government expenditures with a view to encouraging countries to reduce unproductive expenditures , such as excessive military expenditures ; and tracking trends in social expenditures and social indicators in low-income countries and transition economies .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
The Government of Burkina Faso feels that the positive effects of globalization should be more equitably distributed among nations and that joint efforts should be made to overcome its negative effects , for if globalization were to favour only a minority of States it would be illusory and could lead to future conflicts between rich and poor nations .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
The representative of Haiti said that the increasing gap between rich and poor countries had provoked grave tensions and had been one of the factors behind the increasingly vocal contestation of the anti-globalization movement , and behind the recent tragic events in New York .  
Following meetings with government officials and humanitarian partners and field visits to Bi , Cabinda and Malanje provinces , the Executive Director expressed serious concern about the poor level of education for children and stressed the importance of expanded access and increased government resources for the social sectors .  
He noted the Secretary-Generals recommendation that Governments should be urged to take steps to prepare a transparent , stable and predictable framework for investment and for building institutional infrastructures and that multilateral and bilateral donors should be encouraged to adopt suitable measures to permit faster and more extensive debt relief for poor countries .  
He expressed the hope that the outcomes of the Fourth World Tourism Organization Ministerial Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable Development could provide help to developing countries in their efforts , inter alia , to feed the poor and provide shelter ; halt and reverse the spread of HIV / AIDS ; provide safe drinking water ; and offer employment to the millions of unemployed youth .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
However , the Public Information Office is also faced with a population that has a high illiteracy rate , with inexperienced , inadequate and generally poor local media and with weak or non-existent communications infrastructure outside the capital and two provincial towns .  
Besides poverty reduction , the international community had given specific commitments to ensure that by 2015 boys and girls would have equal access to primary schooling and had also resolved to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters , to reduce child mortality by two thirds , to restrict the spread of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , and to improve the conditions of 100-million urban poor by 2020 .  
Recognizing that the interrelationship of ageing and disability among women needs special attention , since lifelong neglect of womens health , social condition , poor nutrition and hard physical labour leaves them at and after menopause especially vulnerable to the risks of disabilities ,  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Calls for the full , speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , and , in this regard , stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative , hence welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but back to back with meetings for the thirteenth replenishment of the Association , and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process ;  
The international community ought therefore to help poor new democracies like Nepal to accelerate their sustainable economic development and social progress and thus help their quest to consolidate democratic polity , human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all , and , in this context , emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor , creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment , increases incomes , promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation ;

The scientific and technological community is convinced that there is already a very wide range of relevant , accessible and often inexpensive technologies and processes available to meet the basic needs of the poor and socially excluded .  
While the Johannesburg agenda was challenging and daunting , it offered a real chance to demonstrate the power of collaboration and to work for the common good , provided that all relevant actors in the United Nations system , Governments , businesses , urban and rural communities , rich and poor countries joined forces to overcome humanitys tremendous challenges and chose the path of sustainable development .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Concerning finance , the Ministers had highlighted the importance of meeting the targets for official development assistance , the need to encourage private sector participation in the promotion of sustainable development through appropriate incentives , ensuring that additional funds were available to the Global Environment Facility , the need for debt relief for highly indebted poor countries , and ensuring market access in developed countries for the exports of developing countries .  
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .  
Creating an efficient environment for and enhancing the effectiveness of social sector investment , including through greater reliance on a participatory local community approach in the design , implementation and evaluation of measures relating to the provision of social infrastructures and basic social services , particularly to improve the condition of the poor members of the community , including through building on deeply embedded traditions of voluntary mutual aid and self-help forms of social capital ;  
The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .
