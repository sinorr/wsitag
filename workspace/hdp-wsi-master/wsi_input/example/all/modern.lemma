The transit of Venus , the celestial wonder of Venus passing between the Earth and the Sun , will happen on June 8 this year .  During which people will be reminded of historical incidents that determined the majority of the modern political and cultural nature of the South Pacific by unusual means .  
Based on the urban planning and the specific context of the city , Beijing will in the coming years focus on the development of small and medium-sized , non-polluting , technology / knowledge-intensive and environment-friendly enterprises , in particular , modern manufacturing enterprises equipped with optical-machinery / electronic integration .  It also hopes to train a number of high level " blue-collar skilled workers . "  
Wu Yuhua , director of Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice , said that the pilot program , which has been in place for a year , shows that the system of corporate attorneys has played a positive role in establishing modern corporate systems , facilitating the scientific , standardized , and legal process of internal corporate management , saving corporate costs , increasing corporate competitiveness , safeguarding corporate production and operation and other aspects .  
At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .  
He said that next year 's main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of socialist market economy reform , further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises , vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring , to appropriately arrange placement for extraneous personnel leaving posts , implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms , continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ;  
A large number of technical and new type managerial and administrative talent was trained , the transformation of the enterprise 's operational mechanism and the reorganization of assets were accelerated and a lot of modern famous brands such as Shanghai Bell , Shanghai Volkswagen , Konka , TCL , etc . were formed . 
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
impel the establishment of a modern enterprise system ; create a mechanism for equal competition ; achieve rational resource allocation ; promote the restructuring and industrial upgrading of all sectors ; and improve the international competitiveness of the industries and service trades concerned .  At the same time , we must do a good job in handling the relationship between observing international rules and carrying out our international obligations on the one hand and ensuring national security and upholding economic stability on the other .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
They must conform to the requirements of the " Guidelines " and the directives of Party committees , chief officers and higher-level headquarters .  They must strengthen their planning , leadership , urgency and checks and ensure that construction in all aspects is implemented .  They must lay a firm foundation for improving our military 's ability in defense and fighting under modern situations and for striving to promote the transcentury development of the construction of military modernization .  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .  With the exception of an extremely small number of complicated diseases that need more researches and studies to overcome them , common diseases can be cured by proper treatment .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
With the support of the party and the state and through their own hard work , people in Tibet have changed the situation of poverty , backwardness , and ignorance left by Tibet 's old society .  Together with people of fraternal nationalities , the Tibetan people have realized happiness in their lives and are seeking modern material civilization and spiritual civilization .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Hong Kong itself has an excellent environment for business operations , as demonstrated in its world-class commercial and financial services , the complete and efficient trade supplementary services , the modern infrastructure facilities , and the perfect system of rule by law ;  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .  
As a result of the continuous increase in the input of educational infrastructure construction , the reinforcement of cultural market management , and the bold assimilation and innovation of all fine achievements of ancient , modern , Chinese , and foreign cultures , we have created a situation under which the tourism culture , popular culture , and elegant culture with Shenzhen 's characteristics have attained common development .  
We should , via this centralized positive education and regular education , try to insure that each Party member can , aiming at winning modern wars in the future as required , be self-motivated to learn and use science and technology , love the army and learn military skills , acquire solid mastery of skills and contribute to national defense reinforcement and to army improvement of combat effectiveness ;  
For medium-sized and small enterprises , we have tried to gradually develop them into professional and special enterprises characterized by being " focused , excellent , unique , and modern " by helping them increase profits and make up losses , and realize investment diversity through adopting such policies as separating the production of military and civilian products , and make full use of merger for the bankrupt , and turning debt to equity .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
They should not only use scientific theories to arm themselves and to guide their practical work , but should also show a thirst for knowledge ; make hard efforts to master the knowledge of modern finance , science and technology , and the law ; familiarize themselves with the operational rules of the international market , and learn from the management of multinational companies ;  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
In order to raise the strategizing competence of captains in the context of modern naval warfare , this detachment adjusted the content of training and took its vessel formation from yellow waters into blue waters , from training under general inshore conditions to rapid-reaction training under complex conditions in the coastal waters .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
The simple " shacks supported by tall posts " for defensive purposes of past years have been replaced by permanent and modern reinforced concrete third generation " sea bastions . "  Platforms for the landing and taking off of helicopters have been built on Yongshu Reef and Zhubi Reef .  
Empirical evidence shows that the peoples of ancient nations , as long as they positively bring into play the profound advantages accumulated from their culture and diligent , brave traditions , can also absorb modern scientific culture 's inventions and creations , keenly innovate , and unceasingly strengthen themselves , and thereby definitely have the capability , while on the road to developing themselves , of writing a new chapter that accords with the demands of the age .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
At the drilling ground this correspondent saw professional support team members carry out emergency repair work on telecommunication optical fiber cables that had been destroyed by the " enemy , " and use modern telecommunication equipment , such as maritime-type portable satellite telephones and VSAT small-sized satellite ground stations , under electronic jamming condition , to serve the purpose of war-time mobile telecommunication support .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
The most important things ahead of logistics units at present are as follows : 1 ) The unified logistics units at various levels should have a sense of urgency , strive to upgrade the quality of commanding modern wars , strengthen the building of information networks , and set up as quickly as possible a swift , sensitive , and high-efficiency commanding system .  
Based on the needs of modern naval warfare that involves surface , underwater , aerial and electromagnetic offense and defense , the ships created life-like battle situations , such as being attacked and damaged by enemy planes and precision guided missiles and launching counterattacks against enemy submarines while navigating in heavy seas at night .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
Given the characteristics of modern wars , particularly the several limited wars over the past several years , warring parties without exception directed their primary attacks and their surgical strike targets at the enemies ' command centers .  Once the command center is destroyed or sustains heavy damage , defeat is only a matter of time .  
In order to draw a parallel between training fields and modern battlegrounds , Zhang Jichen renovated outdated training fields and facilities .  Based on the requirements of 37 tactical training topics , including going through shell craters on a mine field , anti-reconnaissance , and crossing bridges and rivers , modern training fields were established which met the standards of such subjects as basic training , tactical training , special training , and comprehensive training .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .  
The computer-assisted evaluation system that was established at the combined tactical training base has enabled the mechanized division that participated in the exercise to know for sure where they stood in terms of combat effectiveness .  The modern computer-assisted evaluation system uses a tree-structured computer theory to carry out automated processing of electronic mail , positioning , and imagery information compiled from the direct-and-dispatch monitoring and control system ;  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
We should pay special attention to the use of modern tools of the mass media , such as the press , the radio , the television and the Internet , bring into play their role as the main channel for ideological education , and make continuous efforts to create lively forms that can reach people 's ears , brain and heart .  
On the basis of carrying on tradition , the college has updated its concepts according to the new changes in the new stage and eliminated the past curricular theme of cultivating specialized people with uniquely applicable courses.The college has developed a composite education based on universally applicable courses in order to cultivate " versatile people " that can meet the needs of modern wars .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
In an area where there were high mountains , steep cliffs , long and deep valleys , thick bushes , and ferocious animals , a " special assault group " was faced with a ruthless battle : It had to accurately find a way out by crossing through a primeval forest as deep as 35 kilometers in the pitch-black night within 11 hours without being discovered by the " enemy " forces , who were armed with all types of modern reconnaissance equipment . 
Behind the tough talk about successfully fighting two modern wars is reflected the hollow essence of the Americans in bullying the weak with strength and bullying the weak but fearing the strong .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
clearly defined the relevant study tasks and targets ; organized officers and men to study electronics science , microelectronics science , photoelectron science and other modern scientific and technological know-how ; and laid a solid knowledge foundation for mastering new equipment , and conducting exercises on new subjects .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
From ancient wars through cold-weapon wars and hot-weapon wars to modern mechanized wars and high-tech wars , what weapons to use when a country goes to war is not determined by the subjective will of man , but by the level of productive forces prevailing at the time .  
Reporters learned from relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarterstoday that following the construction and development in the past half a century , our armed forces have bid farewell to the era of spreading antidotes by hand and using antidote carts drawn by horses , and have established over 100 systems of modern anti-chemical warfare equipment under nine major series , including the poison-detecting , anti-toxin , cleaning , smoke-generating , and flame-throwing systems .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
Recalling the history of Xiamen Special Economic Zone over the past 20 years at the turn of the centuries , we have found : By riding on the east wind of reform and opening up , Xiamen has risen and turned into a big port with modern glamour , a hot land for investment , and a modern medium-sized city with an economic and social environment marked by coordinated development in the southeast of our country through efforts made by only one generation of people .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .

Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values .

This explains why so many people resort to casting fortunes and interpreting horoscopes .

Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them .

This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic .

The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions .

Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide .

Confined to modern living spaces , most domestically-raised hawks look more like homeless puppies , " sitting listlessly in a tiny room , with sparse and thin feathers , always nervous and alert and ready to strike , but finding themselves tied down and unable to fly . "  
The price of falconry : If you want the hawks to have glossy and healthy-looking plumage , be vigorous and formidable , fly high , and aim sure , as they do in the wild , it takes a lot of time and effort . Given modern lifestyles , it 's impossible for most people to find the patience or time to take care of the " troublesome , " tempestuous animals from morning to night .

For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .

In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .

His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past .

The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .

Che-ho started asking if he could stay out until late at night . He dyed his hair , made repeated pleas for a pager and secretly brought his girlfriend home .  
From a modern perspective , the ancient Chinese used the Solar Terms to integrate astronomical and meteorological observations . They have a scientific derivation - - the earth rotates at a tilted angle as it orbits around the sun .

Of the three concerts in the event , two were completely sold out , and not even the extra standing tickets were enough to meet the demand .

A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .

But when such pipes in these cities were connected one after another , they formed rather comprehensive sewage systems .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
For example , to get his patients to release their emotions , he uses the Buddhist tantric " methods for seeing and thinking " as well as methods making use of modern physics that involve light , heat and magnetism . He teaches patients to use deep meditation to focus their energy on the part of the body that is uncomfortable in daily life . He also uses yoga to dispel accumulated depressed energy through relaxing the body .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
At that time the pop music market was dominated by Western recordings or by superficial Mandarin bubble-gum music . Yang 's appeal on behalf of " modern folk music " touched a deep chord with young intellectuals , and inspired many like-minded young people to create their own works . The style spread rapidly from campuses to restaurants , television , and every nook and cranny of society .  
( Xinshi , meaning " new poetry , " refers to all modern free verse in the vernacular . This form , pioneered in the 1920s and 1930s , is called " new " to distinguish it from the traditional Chinese poetic forms described above . ) Before the 1950s , xinshi was romantic and emotive . Just look back at works like Hsu Chih-mo 's " Coincidentally , " Liu Pan-nung 's " How Can I Not Miss Her , " or Luo Chia-lun 's " A Passage Through the Great Wall . "  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
Art professor Chiang Hsun praised Chungking Express , Doyle 's work of last year , because it " uses brand-new visual images and constructs in a nebulous manner the solitary realities of modern people . The images appear as if from a kaleidoscope , too frantic for the viewer to catch . Kaleidoscopes are sumptuous and charming , but they merely present a cluster of color fragments . This film pushes the sensual enjoyment of vision to its nihilistic limit . "  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
But these days , other products which have the same symbolic meaning - - like turtle-shaped patterns constructed out of canned food or made from mushrooms or day lilies - - are widely popular ; some people even just use cash as a substitute . And anyway , modern life is not suited to such ceremonies as the qigui . In the old days , after the ceremony the cakes would be divided up among the extended family and friends .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue . But there was innovation in form . Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , who held tremendous power , assembled some of the greatest operatic talents in the country to figure out how to turn the traditional forms of Peking opera into something that would work for modern people .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture . His humor and criticism ought to have pushed modern Chinese to engage in self-reflection and seek progress .  
Because problems are not readily apparent at the time gifted and talented students are selected , the National Science Council 's Science Education Office unveiled another plan three years ago for an in-depth investigation of the qualities needed by today 's gifted and talented science students . The aim was to discuss and develop suitable methods of intelligence testing to meet modern needs .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
Q : As you have said , the intellectuals threw out the most refined part of traditional music , and ordinarily people talk about aesthetic values in social terms , in terms of elite or common values , so they belittle folk music . In an era such as this , when traditional music is becoming more and more distant from modern life , what use does it have , and how do we obtain access to it ?  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
He notes that modern national dress must have five key characteristics : it must be comfortable , artistic , modern , suited to the locality , and universal . He calls his ideal national dress shuya , which means " comfortable and elegant . " Taking the lead himself , two years ago he put aside his Western suits and asked a tailor to make a shuya outfit that Yu himself had designed . He wears it to work and to give lectures .  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
" The advantage of building docks yourself is that it allows for easier administrative control , and you can reduce costs , " an Evergreen representative says . The company has experience running docks in many different places , and thus they have trained staff who know the tricks of the trade and are better able to meet varying demands . Furthermore , " Evergreen 's container fleet is young , and its efficiency grows when modern dock equipment is available . "  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
Recently , at the invitation of Taipei City Government , Morris Chang , chairman of the powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) , delivered a lecture entitled " New Recruits for the 21st Century . " The specification he described for modern employees included these requirements : The ability to actively participate in political and social work ; an international perspective ; taking pleasure in cooperative endeavor ; a good general understanding of science and technology ; and the ability to think independently . Finally , they should be " specialized all-rounders . "  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
But most modern people instead consume great amounts of fish , meats , and fast food , and have long forgotten that there are many edible things in nature that are rich in nutrients . These green leafy vegetables can all provide vitamin C , iron , folic acid , and calcium .  
In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution . Just like the modern curricula for languages , sciences , history , geography , art and physical education , the math curriculum has been designed to teach small numbers of the elite . Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
Urbanization has also made interactions between people more complex . Some of the psychological problems of modern people are not like those of the past , which were comprehensible to the average person . For this reason , more people have been going to see psychological counselors over the last few years . The numbers of people waiting to see a doctor in the psychiatric wards of hospitals or at institutions which provide psychological care provide ample evidence of this .  
Bridging the ancient and the modern Having painted ladies of the Han and Tang dynasties , Lee Su Yue then traveled back to the present , treating images of women more familiar to her . She uses light ink to sparsely sketch their fine appearances , with distant moods to transmit the different character of each subject .  
Nonetheless , says Li Lan , chairperson of the Sino-American Folk Arts Association , located in the United States , in Lee 's paintings there lurks a glorious and mysterious cultural China , marching slowly from the traditional to the modern , just like those personalities that have come to life through her brushes-very elegant and languorous .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
In addition to practically oriented research , Professor Ptak 's main areas of study also include Chinese classical and modern novels , the early history of China 's maritime trade , the history of China 's international relations , and the history of Macao with reference to Sino-Portuguese relations . He gained his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg with a thesis on the Yuan-dynasty dramatist Zheng Tingyu , and his professorship with a monograph on the story of the early-15th-century voyages of the imperial eunuch Zheng He , as portrayed in Ming dynasty drama and novels .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
Breast cancer , for example , is likely to increase because of several risk factors : modern women start menstruation earlier , get married Based on risk factors in the environment , Chen Chien-jen estimates later , and are less likely to breast feed ; intake of animal fat is increasing ; and modern lifestyles are more stressful and erratic .  
In the lore of Chinese medicine , Shen Nong is credited with having discovered countless medicines by trying out various herbs on himself , but even he would have to be amazed at the willingness of people in modern Taiwan to experiment on themselves . Many people think of cancer as a death sentence . If they are unlucky enough to be hit , they become desperate and will risk any kind of treatment , however unorthodox . In fact , this is not hard to understand .  
Other medical works also refer , by a variety of names , to various cancers such as gastric , esophageal , intestinal and bone cancer . Their descriptions of the symptoms are almost identical to the observations of modern anatomical medicine .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
They opposed cliched formalism in writing , and advocated the use of the modern vernacular instead of the previously dominant classical Chinese . They decried China 's " cannibalistic " feudal ethical code and Confucianism , and demanded women 's rights , the liberation of the individual from the family and so on .  
Reasons for Taiwanese forgetfulness of May Fourth are that modern Taiwan does not face the general national malaise which once afflicted China , Messrs . Democracy and Science have already been realized to some degree , cultural life is highly westernized , and the nativist movement of recent years has tended to increase estrangement from the mainland . " In Taiwan there is little interest in pursuing fundamental issues of China 's recent and modern development , " says Wu Chan-liang .  
In addition to introducing mechanical sets , the Fujianese opera groups adapted to keep up with developments in the movies . When the film Mambo Girl was all the rage , the Fujianese troupes suddenly started doing musicals-which they described as " modern Fujianese opera " - wearing contemporary costumes and mambo-dancing to accompaniment from piano , saxophone and drums . It certainly testifies to the eclectic nature of ko-tzai-hsi , and the opera troupes ' imaginative instinct for self-preservation .  
On Xuanzong 's private chuiwan course , the grass is trimmed neat and smooth , and the four large greens bear a total of ten holes which , just as on a modern golf course , are all marked by flagpoles bearing different-colored pennants .  
He also felt that nanguan had gotten into a terrible rut with hackneyed , sentimental lyrics that did not speak to the concerns of modern society . He wrote lyrics for over 200 new songs which Zhuo then set to music . Among other themes , his songs described Singaporean scenes , delivered satirical commentary on social ills , and expressed the author 's own feelings .  
From the " Nine Chapters " of the esteemed Han minister of state Xiao He-which covered , among other things , lawsuits , standards for arrest , and criminal punishments for robbery and theft-to the later marriage laws , there were 906 volumes under more than 60 separate legal headings . If you add to this supplementary sources of law , like precedents and debates by legal scholars , then the Han code could handle everything that is covered by both statute and customary law in the modern world .  
His mathematical and astronomical researches included mystical topics rejected by modern science . To Fu Ta-wei , a professor of history at National Tsing Hua University , " Shen Gua was not by any means a strict advocate of the scientific method .  
Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion . Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no-one has to worry about getting everything ready . For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year . A bittersweet evening  
Hao Tien-hsia 's words seem a little sad , and there is no banquet of life that does n't come to an end with the guests scattering to the four winds . But what 's important is what lasts : Kao Yang still has his annual dinner , and though these old friends rarely meet , the warm feelings are still there . It 's just that , with the Li-Ku dinner on the fourth day of the year finished , in our modern industrial society , it 's time to go back to work .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
In design terms , to attract young people Peter Sung is tending even more to abandon ornate palace-style accessories in favor of bright , fresh white walls and red gingham tablecloths , along with movable screens carved with Chinese characters , and chairs made from black steel tubing in a Ming-dynasty style , to create a Chinese style with a young and modern feel .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
In traditional China , single-fold eyelids were favored . But modern people are inclined to want large , bright , expressive eyes . For many years now , making of double-fold eyelids has been the most common procedure among cosmetic surgeons .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
In his painting Flying Apsaras , Hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne Buddhist spirits . Critic Wang Chia-chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "  
With rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush he creates fluid , free-floating figures , without faces or personalities , performing their allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm . The resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence . It has been suggested that Hsia Yang himself , the lifelong drifter , is the prototype for these blurry beings .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
We wend our way first through the heavily populated and prosperous Xiamen City and zip along a straight , smooth expressway toward Tongan County , better than 50 kilometers distant . Soon , however , we get off the modern highway and onto bumpy gravel and mud . After an hour and a half we arrive at Lutang Village .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in our daily lives . They are required for virtually all electrical power and fuel , and industries such as petrochemicals and steel ; indeed it is hard to find any modern economic sector that does not need them . Therefore , to demand a decrease in CO2 emissions is asking people to accept a dramatic adjustment to modern life , with a corresponding impact on the economy .  
" Modern people are most easily swayed by things that are framed conceptually , so intuitive spiritual methods have to be packaged in rational terms to make them more acceptable . The new mode of ' spiritual cultivation ' is something that satisfies the demands of modern urbanites , " avers Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
If you come into the downtown area , the National Policy Foundation and the Taiwan Research Institute , set in the middle of the concrete jungle , would , on the other hand , be more reminiscent of the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution in Washington , with large numbers of retired government officials , and therefore tight security , in their modern office buildings .  
Busy as a bee just to make a living , rushing ahead out of fear of falling behind . In the midst of the hustling e-generation , when competition has become the key in which our lives are orchestrated , and pressure has become a constant , how to put one 's heart at ease and live care-free ? Although trendy prescriptions are legion , some have discovered that returning to the ancestral practice of Chinese calligraphy-using a brush-is modern man 's most " soothing " remedy .  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World . It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
In 1911 they pooled their resources to build a big residence with a main entrance designed in the half-Chinese , half-Western architectural style typical of Southeast Asia , while the interior was designed in the traditional manner of a three-sided residential compound ( san he yuan ) . The building materials used are also noteworthy : a mix of modern materials , such as polished aggregate and decorative tiles , with Penghu 's traditional basalt and coral limestone . These are certainly some of the finest exemplars of traditional homes in all of Penghu .  
He enlarged the puppets , put more modern faces on them and dressed them in brighter costumes . He used dry ice and flash powder to create a variety of stage effects . He also made changes to the music , importing a sound system and making bold use of local pop stars and Western music to accompany his plays . His golden-light theater came to dominate puppetry and he himself rose to the top of his generation of puppeteers .  
In this modernistic new musical , Gao Xingjian merges Chinese traditional speaking and singing arts with modern Western theater of the absurd to dramatize how , in the Tang Dynasty , the most famous of Chan koans ( paradoxical statements or questions which , when profoundly meditated upon , may bring the Chan practitioner sudden enlightenment ) became the basis on which power was transmitted from the fifth patriarch , Hungren , to the sixth patriarch , Huineng .  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
A courageous pioneer in literary style , even when he was demoted to governor of Chaozhou Prefecture , Han Yu brought his colorful lifestyle to that far-flung uncivilized southern realm , thereby displaying once again his ability to transcend worldly concerns of fame and fortune , and his characteristic willingness to uphold the values of a life of beauty and goodness . Perhaps this is a better reason for modern scholars to offer a stick of sweet-smelling incense in his memory .  
How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science . But when applied to medicine , perhaps this debate tells us that modern medicine should not completely exclude traditional and folk remedies , and that it may not be the only source of objective , universal , correct and valid knowledge .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
However , Professor Kim was well aware of Hsiao 's romantic temperament and tender nature ; his works have always abounded with vivid color and layer upon layer of beautiful , unforgettable melody . As a result , Kim reminded Hsiao that he need n't be a slave to modern music and its jarring dissonances , encouraging him instead to follow his own musical path .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
" Many people find that the up-close living arrangements of the past were painful for all concerned : the mother , the daughter-in-law and the son who was stuck in between , " notes Lu Lo , assistant professor of Department of Psychology at Fu-Jen Catholic University , who also has a positive take on modern views about filial piety .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
Yeh points out that ever since the May Fourth Movement of 1919 , the traditional principle of filial piety was deemed to be dogmatism . The principle of filial piety was connected to loyalty to the emperor and was thus authoritarian . In modern society , everybody is an independent individual , and so today we talk about relative filial piety .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
The heavily attended concert included both ancient and modern music . The " collective memories " exhibition , with pictures from Wufeng displayed on the exterior wall of the lower compound of the Estate , was very moving . The arts market , the tone of which was dominated by traditional and folk crafts , had a constant stream of visitors . Through this event it seems that the people of Wufeng reclaimed some of their happy memories of the past .  
My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
Nonetheless , when you push open one thick , heavy , lacquered door after another , you are welcomed not by some literary or historical figures of the Republican era , but by dazzling and brightly lit restaurants with spacious , modern decor in an " alternative " style .  
No matter whether modern or postmodern , classical or neoclassical , or an eclectic mix of old and new , restaurants in the " petty bourgeois " or " middle class " style are friendly , welcoming places , neither pretentiously modern in a cold and snooty way , nor self-consciously old school and superior . Taiwanese have long been good at creating this kind of atmosphere .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
As for questions raised by women 's groups , Shih Chao-hui , who also supports the pro-life position , acknowledges that facing up to the " realities " of abortion may indeed seem like a cruel thing to subject audiences to . And yet , she asks , are not modern terms such as " genetic health , " " termination of pregnancy , " and " induced abortion " simply linguistic traps designed to beautify the act of abortion ? A true view of the body  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

Because of the widespread and increasing use of commercial energy in all economic sectors of modern societies , various concerns have often been expressed about the adequacy of reserves and resources to meet future demand .  
The ultimate protection , however , lay in the legitimate exercise of Chamorro selfdetermination and the subsequent structuring of a political status conducive to their cultural survival and entry into the modern world in their own right .  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
The basic coordinate of Slovakia 's foreign policy is its integration into the geopolitical and economic sphere with which we not only have numerous historical ties , but also and , I think , more importantly with which we share the same hierarchy of modern civilized values .  
Moreover , with a view to building a peaceful , prosperous and modern nation , my Government has formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in the political , economic and social spheres .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
We , the leaders of the modern world , are faced with a great responsibility : we must be united and rise above our distinct personal , party and national interests , and seek the vision of a new world which will hold a future for every individual , every nation and State , for the universality of spirit and for the tolerance of the different .

On another subject , my delegation fully supports the proposals relating to advancing financial intermediation in Africa , as this is a way to strengthen local savings structures and to link them with modern banks and financial institutions , with a view to generating local resources at this time when official development assistance is dwindling at an unprecedented rate .  
Although there may still be many difficulties and challenges along the road ahead , we are confident that , through several generations of hard work , our people will lift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and turn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern country .  
In order to avoid even more serious and even catastrophic consequences for the rural environment and productivity , substantial increases in the use of fossil fuels for rural energy services will be unavoidable if modern renewable energy technologies can not make a major contribution to the rural energy mix .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .

Nevertheless the path explored by the reformist Arab writers of the nineteenth century should be pursued and legal principles elaborated capable of bridging the gap between various communities and modern public administration , a step which is needed for participation in the world economy .  
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
Now , when we commemorate the historic injustice of 55 years ago , let our thoughts not be overwhelmed by the memory of the nefarious characters , Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin , who together assumed grave responsibilities for some of the most horrifying acts of territorial rape in the modern history of Europe , but rather remember the great politicians , Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , the makers of the historic Franco-German reconciliation !  
In current conflicts , peace-keeping operations may benefit from using modern technologies to gather information ( weight , heat and infra-red remote-sensing devices ) , to detect and defuse mines ( infra-red , ground-penetrating radar ) , to improve communications and inter-operability among multinational United Nations forces , to equip blue helmets with more effective military means while causing a minimum of damage to humans , and to assist in humanitarian efforts .

The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .

Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .  
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .

This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
Although the potential biomass resource base is immense and dedicated energy crops could add significantly to that resource base , modern , efficient use of biomass remains to be promoted and applied ; a small increase in the efficiency of burning fuelwood would have noticeable effects on carbon and particulate emissions .  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .

Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population .

Wu Yuhua , director of Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice , said that the pilot program , which has been in place for a year , shows that the system of corporate attorneys has played a positive role in establishing modern corporate systems , facilitating the scientific , standardized , and legal process of internal corporate management , saving corporate costs , increasing corporate competitiveness , safeguarding corporate production and operation and other aspects .  
At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .  
He said that next year 's main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of socialist market economy reform , further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises , vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring , to appropriately arrange placement for extraneous personnel leaving posts , implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms , continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ;  
A large number of technical and new type managerial and administrative talent was trained , the transformation of the enterprise 's operational mechanism and the reorganization of assets were accelerated and a lot of modern famous brands such as Shanghai Bell , Shanghai Volkswagen , Konka , TCL , etc . were formed . 
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
impel the establishment of a modern enterprise system ; create a mechanism for equal competition ; achieve rational resource allocation ; promote the restructuring and industrial upgrading of all sectors ; and improve the international competitiveness of the industries and service trades concerned .  At the same time , we must do a good job in handling the relationship between observing international rules and carrying out our international obligations on the one hand and ensuring national security and upholding economic stability on the other .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
They must conform to the requirements of the " Guidelines " and the directives of Party committees , chief officers and higher-level headquarters .  They must strengthen their planning , leadership , urgency and checks and ensure that construction in all aspects is implemented .  They must lay a firm foundation for improving our military 's ability in defense and fighting under modern situations and for striving to promote the transcentury development of the construction of military modernization .  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .  With the exception of an extremely small number of complicated diseases that need more researches and studies to overcome them , common diseases can be cured by proper treatment .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
With the support of the party and the state and through their own hard work , people in Tibet have changed the situation of poverty , backwardness , and ignorance left by Tibet 's old society .  Together with people of fraternal nationalities , the Tibetan people have realized happiness in their lives and are seeking modern material civilization and spiritual civilization .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Hong Kong itself has an excellent environment for business operations , as demonstrated in its world-class commercial and financial services , the complete and efficient trade supplementary services , the modern infrastructure facilities , and the perfect system of rule by law ;  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .  
As a result of the continuous increase in the input of educational infrastructure construction , the reinforcement of cultural market management , and the bold assimilation and innovation of all fine achievements of ancient , modern , Chinese , and foreign cultures , we have created a situation under which the tourism culture , popular culture , and elegant culture with Shenzhen 's characteristics have attained common development .  
We should , via this centralized positive education and regular education , try to insure that each Party member can , aiming at winning modern wars in the future as required , be self-motivated to learn and use science and technology , love the army and learn military skills , acquire solid mastery of skills and contribute to national defense reinforcement and to army improvement of combat effectiveness ;  
For medium-sized and small enterprises , we have tried to gradually develop them into professional and special enterprises characterized by being " focused , excellent , unique , and modern " by helping them increase profits and make up losses , and realize investment diversity through adopting such policies as separating the production of military and civilian products , and make full use of merger for the bankrupt , and turning debt to equity .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
They should not only use scientific theories to arm themselves and to guide their practical work , but should also show a thirst for knowledge ; make hard efforts to master the knowledge of modern finance , science and technology , and the law ; familiarize themselves with the operational rules of the international market , and learn from the management of multinational companies ;  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
In order to raise the strategizing competence of captains in the context of modern naval warfare , this detachment adjusted the content of training and took its vessel formation from yellow waters into blue waters , from training under general inshore conditions to rapid-reaction training under complex conditions in the coastal waters .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
The simple " shacks supported by tall posts " for defensive purposes of past years have been replaced by permanent and modern reinforced concrete third generation " sea bastions . "  Platforms for the landing and taking off of helicopters have been built on Yongshu Reef and Zhubi Reef .  
Empirical evidence shows that the peoples of ancient nations , as long as they positively bring into play the profound advantages accumulated from their culture and diligent , brave traditions , can also absorb modern scientific culture 's inventions and creations , keenly innovate , and unceasingly strengthen themselves , and thereby definitely have the capability , while on the road to developing themselves , of writing a new chapter that accords with the demands of the age .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
At the drilling ground this correspondent saw professional support team members carry out emergency repair work on telecommunication optical fiber cables that had been destroyed by the " enemy , " and use modern telecommunication equipment , such as maritime-type portable satellite telephones and VSAT small-sized satellite ground stations , under electronic jamming condition , to serve the purpose of war-time mobile telecommunication support .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
The most important things ahead of logistics units at present are as follows : 1 ) The unified logistics units at various levels should have a sense of urgency , strive to upgrade the quality of commanding modern wars , strengthen the building of information networks , and set up as quickly as possible a swift , sensitive , and high-efficiency commanding system .  
Based on the needs of modern naval warfare that involves surface , underwater , aerial and electromagnetic offense and defense , the ships created life-like battle situations , such as being attacked and damaged by enemy planes and precision guided missiles and launching counterattacks against enemy submarines while navigating in heavy seas at night .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
Given the characteristics of modern wars , particularly the several limited wars over the past several years , warring parties without exception directed their primary attacks and their surgical strike targets at the enemies ' command centers .  Once the command center is destroyed or sustains heavy damage , defeat is only a matter of time .  
In order to draw a parallel between training fields and modern battlegrounds , Zhang Jichen renovated outdated training fields and facilities .  Based on the requirements of 37 tactical training topics , including going through shell craters on a mine field , anti-reconnaissance , and crossing bridges and rivers , modern training fields were established which met the standards of such subjects as basic training , tactical training , special training , and comprehensive training .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .  
The computer-assisted evaluation system that was established at the combined tactical training base has enabled the mechanized division that participated in the exercise to know for sure where they stood in terms of combat effectiveness .  The modern computer-assisted evaluation system uses a tree-structured computer theory to carry out automated processing of electronic mail , positioning , and imagery information compiled from the direct-and-dispatch monitoring and control system ;  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
We should pay special attention to the use of modern tools of the mass media , such as the press , the radio , the television and the Internet , bring into play their role as the main channel for ideological education , and make continuous efforts to create lively forms that can reach people 's ears , brain and heart .  
On the basis of carrying on tradition , the college has updated its concepts according to the new changes in the new stage and eliminated the past curricular theme of cultivating specialized people with uniquely applicable courses.The college has developed a composite education based on universally applicable courses in order to cultivate " versatile people " that can meet the needs of modern wars .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
In an area where there were high mountains , steep cliffs , long and deep valleys , thick bushes , and ferocious animals , a " special assault group " was faced with a ruthless battle : It had to accurately find a way out by crossing through a primeval forest as deep as 35 kilometers in the pitch-black night within 11 hours without being discovered by the " enemy " forces , who were armed with all types of modern reconnaissance equipment . 
Behind the tough talk about successfully fighting two modern wars is reflected the hollow essence of the Americans in bullying the weak with strength and bullying the weak but fearing the strong .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
clearly defined the relevant study tasks and targets ; organized officers and men to study electronics science , microelectronics science , photoelectron science and other modern scientific and technological know-how ; and laid a solid knowledge foundation for mastering new equipment , and conducting exercises on new subjects .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
From ancient wars through cold-weapon wars and hot-weapon wars to modern mechanized wars and high-tech wars , what weapons to use when a country goes to war is not determined by the subjective will of man , but by the level of productive forces prevailing at the time .  
Reporters learned from relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarterstoday that following the construction and development in the past half a century , our armed forces have bid farewell to the era of spreading antidotes by hand and using antidote carts drawn by horses , and have established over 100 systems of modern anti-chemical warfare equipment under nine major series , including the poison-detecting , anti-toxin , cleaning , smoke-generating , and flame-throwing systems .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
Recalling the history of Xiamen Special Economic Zone over the past 20 years at the turn of the centuries , we have found : By riding on the east wind of reform and opening up , Xiamen has risen and turned into a big port with modern glamour , a hot land for investment , and a modern medium-sized city with an economic and social environment marked by coordinated development in the southeast of our country through efforts made by only one generation of people .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .  
In the New Year editorial , the DPRK stated that it would , in the new year , " streamline the current economic foundation , carry out comprehensive transformation of the economy with modern technologies and methods , step up the building of power , coal , metallurgy , rail transport sectors , increase agricultural production , develop the light industry , and raise the people 's living standards . "

Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values .

This explains why so many people resort to casting fortunes and interpreting horoscopes .

Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents .

Add to this that modern people are more carefree about heirs , and also that medical advances have decreased concerns about having children at a later age ; and moreover it is more and more popular for the divorced or widowed to seek a second spring - - all these things mean that age is already not a crucial factor in deciding on whether it is appropriate to marry .  
This traditional " matchmaker " field , which one would have thought would have been wiped out by free choice in love and marriage , is not only alive and kicking ; in the last ten years it has experienced a complete turnaround to become a hot profession . Besides the matchmaking columns and programs popular in the media , an even greater number of specialized , commercialized " modern super matchmakers " are popping up everywhere .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Shih Tsui-feng feels that , apart from the fortunate few who have their own homes , most modern urbanites are hard put to share their cramped living spaces with the traditional New Year 's couplets , but he says , " Still , even if it 's just a single character , such as ' Spring ' or ' good fortune ' - - hung upside down - - it 's always nice to hang something that adds a little holiday spirit and traditional flavor to the season .

The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions .

Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide .

But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples .

Confined to modern living spaces , most domestically-raised hawks look more like homeless puppies , " sitting listlessly in a tiny room , with sparse and thin feathers , always nervous and alert and ready to strike , but finding themselves tied down and unable to fly . "  
The price of falconry : If you want the hawks to have glossy and healthy-looking plumage , be vigorous and formidable , fly high , and aim sure , as they do in the wild , it takes a lot of time and effort . Given modern lifestyles , it 's impossible for most people to find the patience or time to take care of the " troublesome , " tempestuous animals from morning to night .

For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .

In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .  
Painter Kuo Chen-chang used Western pop art techniques , with rough black lines and bright , beautiful colors , to tell the Chinese myth of Kua Fu , who died trying to reach the sun . His work is a metaphor for pitiable modern people in their endless quest to make a living .

His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past .

The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
Taking this theme a step farther , Chu Chia-hua 's cloth of abundantly colorful flowers and dried roses uses common objects to show the consumer manipulation people are subject to in modern urban life , where the flow of information is unchecked .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics .

Their eldest son Che-ho turned 17 this year . Ever since he entered the equivalent of tenth grade in his vocational high school-cum-junior college , parents Chung Chiang-shan and Chang Pi-yun have seen their son pulled between what he 's been taught at home , on the one hand , and peer pressures and the lures of modern society on the other . Che-ho started asking if he could stay out until late at night . He dyed his hair , made repeated pleas for a pager and secretly brought his girlfriend home .  
From a modern perspective , the ancient Chinese used the Solar Terms to integrate astronomical and meteorological observations . They have a scientific derivation - - the earth rotates at a tilted angle as it orbits around the sun . According to the different position of each location on the globe , the sun 's rays will land at correspondingly different angles , and in this way the alternating seasonal cycle of winter , spring , summer and autumn is produced .  
Of the three concerts in the event , two were completely sold out , and not even the extra standing tickets were enough to meet the demand . And with the New York audiences ' rapturous applause , the concerts lasted two and a half hours instead of two as originally planned , breaking with the stereotype that modern music is a curse at the box office .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
An unnecessary luxuryIn the early years of the Republic of China , the famous author Lu Hsun , in a short story entitled " The Blessing " ( " Chu Fu " ) , published in his anthology Indecision ( " P'aihuai " ) , satirized a modern youth who scorned the characters of the feudal age , yet longed for " Fuhsing Lou Restaurant 's shark fin simmered in clear broth , a dollar a serving , cheap and tasty - - is it still so cheap ?

Into the modern eraThe Directorate-General of Telecommunications ( DGT ) is located on a street corner behind the presidential offices . The DGT building has rounded corners , lines wrapping horizontally under the window sills ( rather than vertical lines which carry one 's eye up and down the building ) , rectangular windows instead of arched ones , bright coloring , and a complete absence of decorative embellishment . All these features declare that this is an edifice composed after 1920 and linked to European " modern " architecture .  
A song sung in the setting sunAfter the X-rated performance had finished , several singers , who were rushed to the locale by special delivery , came onstage and began to sing .

If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
For example , to get his patients to release their emotions , he uses the Buddhist tantric " methods for seeing and thinking " as well as methods making use of modern physics that involve light , heat and magnetism . He teaches patients to use deep meditation to focus their energy on the part of the body that is uncomfortable in daily life . He also uses yoga to dispel accumulated depressed energy through relaxing the body .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
At that time the pop music market was dominated by Western recordings or by superficial Mandarin bubble-gum music . Yang 's appeal on behalf of " modern folk music " touched a deep chord with young intellectuals , and inspired many like-minded young people to create their own works . The style spread rapidly from campuses to restaurants , television , and every nook and cranny of society .  
( Xinshi , meaning " new poetry , " refers to all modern free verse in the vernacular . This form , pioneered in the 1920s and 1930s , is called " new " to distinguish it from the traditional Chinese poetic forms described above . ) Before the 1950s , xinshi was romantic and emotive . Just look back at works like Hsu Chih-mo 's " Coincidentally , " Liu Pan-nung 's " How Can I Not Miss Her , " or Luo Chia-lun 's " A Passage Through the Great Wall . "  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
Art professor Chiang Hsun praised Chungking Express , Doyle 's work of last year , because it " uses brand-new visual images and constructs in a nebulous manner the solitary realities of modern people . The images appear as if from a kaleidoscope , too frantic for the viewer to catch . Kaleidoscopes are sumptuous and charming , but they merely present a cluster of color fragments . This film pushes the sensual enjoyment of vision to its nihilistic limit . "  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
But these days , other products which have the same symbolic meaning - - like turtle-shaped patterns constructed out of canned food or made from mushrooms or day lilies - - are widely popular ; some people even just use cash as a substitute . And anyway , modern life is not suited to such ceremonies as the qigui . In the old days , after the ceremony the cakes would be divided up among the extended family and friends .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue . But there was innovation in form . Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , who held tremendous power , assembled some of the greatest operatic talents in the country to figure out how to turn the traditional forms of Peking opera into something that would work for modern people .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture . His humor and criticism ought to have pushed modern Chinese to engage in self-reflection and seek progress .  
Because problems are not readily apparent at the time gifted and talented students are selected , the National Science Council 's Science Education Office unveiled another plan three years ago for an in-depth investigation of the qualities needed by today 's gifted and talented science students . The aim was to discuss and develop suitable methods of intelligence testing to meet modern needs .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
The idea that one can accumulate merit through charity is part of the traditional Chinese concept that deeds ( good or bad ) will earn their just desserts . Prior to the modern volunteer conception of " finding joy through helping others , " the idea of " gaining merit for the nether world " was long the main motive force to encourage ordinary people to do good .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
Q : As you have said , the intellectuals threw out the most refined part of traditional music , and ordinarily people talk about aesthetic values in social terms , in terms of elite or common values , so they belittle folk music . In an era such as this , when traditional music is becoming more and more distant from modern life , what use does it have , and how do we obtain access to it ?  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
He notes that modern national dress must have five key characteristics : it must be comfortable , artistic , modern , suited to the locality , and universal . He calls his ideal national dress shuya , which means " comfortable and elegant . " Taking the lead himself , two years ago he put aside his Western suits and asked a tailor to make a shuya outfit that Yu himself had designed . He wears it to work and to give lectures .  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
" The advantage of building docks yourself is that it allows for easier administrative control , and you can reduce costs , " an Evergreen representative says . The company has experience running docks in many different places , and thus they have trained staff who know the tricks of the trade and are better able to meet varying demands . Furthermore , " Evergreen 's container fleet is young , and its efficiency grows when modern dock equipment is available . "  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
In the 1980s , among all the social movements , the environmental protection movement found the most resonance around the world . This , coupled with the rise of the aboriginal rights movement , caused environmentalists , in the wake of modern man 's overdevelopment of land , to begin to reexamine methods of living and urge a return to natural , simple lifestyles . As a result , the complete set of cultural ceremonies and behavior that aborigines have as a result of hunting have once again been embraced .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
Recently , at the invitation of Taipei City Government , Morris Chang , chairman of the powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) , delivered a lecture entitled " New Recruits for the 21st Century . " The specification he described for modern employees included these requirements : The ability to actively participate in political and social work ; an international perspective ; taking pleasure in cooperative endeavor ; a good general understanding of science and technology ; and the ability to think independently . Finally , they should be " specialized all-rounders . "  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
But most modern people instead consume great amounts of fish , meats , and fast food , and have long forgotten that there are many edible things in nature that are rich in nutrients . These green leafy vegetables can all provide vitamin C , iron , folic acid , and calcium .  
In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution . Just like the modern curricula for languages , sciences , history , geography , art and physical education , the math curriculum has been designed to teach small numbers of the elite . Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
There are many different kinds of oolong tea , including lightly cured Shanlin River high mountain , medium-fired smokey dongding , Ali Mountain variety , and even yancha ( dried , then set aside for five years , then cured the traditional way , over a charcoal fire-as opposed to the modern methods of natural gas flame or electric heat curing ) . There are also all manner of aromas-dark , robust or sweet-and of flavors . The variety of grades of Taiwan oolong shows how far its manufacture has progressed .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
Urbanization has also made interactions between people more complex . Some of the psychological problems of modern people are not like those of the past , which were comprehensible to the average person . For this reason , more people have been going to see psychological counselors over the last few years . The numbers of people waiting to see a doctor in the psychiatric wards of hospitals or at institutions which provide psychological care provide ample evidence of this .  
Bridging the ancient and the modern Having painted ladies of the Han and Tang dynasties , Lee Su Yue then traveled back to the present , treating images of women more familiar to her . She uses light ink to sparsely sketch their fine appearances , with distant moods to transmit the different character of each subject .  
Nonetheless , says Li Lan , chairperson of the Sino-American Folk Arts Association , located in the United States , in Lee 's paintings there lurks a glorious and mysterious cultural China , marching slowly from the traditional to the modern , just like those personalities that have come to life through her brushes-very elegant and languorous .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
In addition to practically oriented research , Professor Ptak 's main areas of study also include Chinese classical and modern novels , the early history of China 's maritime trade , the history of China 's international relations , and the history of Macao with reference to Sino-Portuguese relations . He gained his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg with a thesis on the Yuan-dynasty dramatist Zheng Tingyu , and his professorship with a monograph on the story of the early-15th-century voyages of the imperial eunuch Zheng He , as portrayed in Ming dynasty drama and novels .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
Breast cancer , for example , is likely to increase because of several risk factors : modern women start menstruation earlier , get married Based on risk factors in the environment , Chen Chien-jen estimates later , and are less likely to breast feed ; intake of animal fat is increasing ; and modern lifestyles are more stressful and erratic .  
In the lore of Chinese medicine , Shen Nong is credited with having discovered countless medicines by trying out various herbs on himself , but even he would have to be amazed at the willingness of people in modern Taiwan to experiment on themselves . Many people think of cancer as a death sentence . If they are unlucky enough to be hit , they become desperate and will risk any kind of treatment , however unorthodox . In fact , this is not hard to understand .  
Other medical works also refer , by a variety of names , to various cancers such as gastric , esophageal , intestinal and bone cancer . Their descriptions of the symptoms are almost identical to the observations of modern anatomical medicine .  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
They opposed cliched formalism in writing , and advocated the use of the modern vernacular instead of the previously dominant classical Chinese . They decried China 's " cannibalistic " feudal ethical code and Confucianism , and demanded women 's rights , the liberation of the individual from the family and so on .  
Reasons for Taiwanese forgetfulness of May Fourth are that modern Taiwan does not face the general national malaise which once afflicted China , Messrs . Democracy and Science have already been realized to some degree , cultural life is highly westernized , and the nativist movement of recent years has tended to increase estrangement from the mainland . " In Taiwan there is little interest in pursuing fundamental issues of China 's recent and modern development , " says Wu Chan-liang .  
In addition to introducing mechanical sets , the Fujianese opera groups adapted to keep up with developments in the movies . When the film Mambo Girl was all the rage , the Fujianese troupes suddenly started doing musicals-which they described as " modern Fujianese opera " - wearing contemporary costumes and mambo-dancing to accompaniment from piano , saxophone and drums . It certainly testifies to the eclectic nature of ko-tzai-hsi , and the opera troupes ' imaginative instinct for self-preservation .  
On Xuanzong 's private chuiwan course , the grass is trimmed neat and smooth , and the four large greens bear a total of ten holes which , just as on a modern golf course , are all marked by flagpoles bearing different-colored pennants .  
He also felt that nanguan had gotten into a terrible rut with hackneyed , sentimental lyrics that did not speak to the concerns of modern society . He wrote lyrics for over 200 new songs which Zhuo then set to music . Among other themes , his songs described Singaporean scenes , delivered satirical commentary on social ills , and expressed the author 's own feelings .  
From the " Nine Chapters " of the esteemed Han minister of state Xiao He-which covered , among other things , lawsuits , standards for arrest , and criminal punishments for robbery and theft-to the later marriage laws , there were 906 volumes under more than 60 separate legal headings . If you add to this supplementary sources of law , like precedents and debates by legal scholars , then the Han code could handle everything that is covered by both statute and customary law in the modern world .  
His mathematical and astronomical researches included mystical topics rejected by modern science . To Fu Ta-wei , a professor of history at National Tsing Hua University , " Shen Gua was not by any means a strict advocate of the scientific method .  
Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion . Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no-one has to worry about getting everything ready . For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year . A bittersweet evening  
Hao Tien-hsia 's words seem a little sad , and there is no banquet of life that does n't come to an end with the guests scattering to the four winds . But what 's important is what lasts : Kao Yang still has his annual dinner , and though these old friends rarely meet , the warm feelings are still there . It 's just that , with the Li-Ku dinner on the fourth day of the year finished , in our modern industrial society , it 's time to go back to work .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
In design terms , to attract young people Peter Sung is tending even more to abandon ornate palace-style accessories in favor of bright , fresh white walls and red gingham tablecloths , along with movable screens carved with Chinese characters , and chairs made from black steel tubing in a Ming-dynasty style , to create a Chinese style with a young and modern feel .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology .

In traditional China , single-fold eyelids were favored . But modern people are inclined to want large , bright , expressive eyes . For many years now , making of double-fold eyelids has been the most common procedure among cosmetic surgeons .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
In his painting Flying Apsaras , Hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne Buddhist spirits . Critic Wang Chia-chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "  
With rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush he creates fluid , free-floating figures , without faces or personalities , performing their allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm . The resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence . It has been suggested that Hsia Yang himself , the lifelong drifter , is the prototype for these blurry beings .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
We wend our way first through the heavily populated and prosperous Xiamen City and zip along a straight , smooth expressway toward Tongan County , better than 50 kilometers distant . Soon , however , we get off the modern highway and onto bumpy gravel and mud . After an hour and a half we arrive at Lutang Village .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in our daily lives . They are required for virtually all electrical power and fuel , and industries such as petrochemicals and steel ; indeed it is hard to find any modern economic sector that does not need them . Therefore , to demand a decrease in CO2 emissions is asking people to accept a dramatic adjustment to modern life , with a corresponding impact on the economy .  
" Modern people are most easily swayed by things that are framed conceptually , so intuitive spiritual methods have to be packaged in rational terms to make them more acceptable . The new mode of ' spiritual cultivation ' is something that satisfies the demands of modern urbanites , " avers Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
If you come into the downtown area , the National Policy Foundation and the Taiwan Research Institute , set in the middle of the concrete jungle , would , on the other hand , be more reminiscent of the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution in Washington , with large numbers of retired government officials , and therefore tight security , in their modern office buildings .  
Busy as a bee just to make a living , rushing ahead out of fear of falling behind . In the midst of the hustling e-generation , when competition has become the key in which our lives are orchestrated , and pressure has become a constant , how to put one 's heart at ease and live care-free ? Although trendy prescriptions are legion , some have discovered that returning to the ancestral practice of Chinese calligraphy-using a brush-is modern man 's most " soothing " remedy .  
Ideally , this brief journey through the MWR should allow visitors to transcend the noise of ordinary existence and reflect on the meaning of life , and then return to aspects of concrete existence in the Avatamsaka World . It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
In 1911 they pooled their resources to build a big residence with a main entrance designed in the half-Chinese , half-Western architectural style typical of Southeast Asia , while the interior was designed in the traditional manner of a three-sided residential compound ( san he yuan ) . The building materials used are also noteworthy : a mix of modern materials , such as polished aggregate and decorative tiles , with Penghu 's traditional basalt and coral limestone . These are certainly some of the finest exemplars of traditional homes in all of Penghu .  
He enlarged the puppets , put more modern faces on them and dressed them in brighter costumes . He used dry ice and flash powder to create a variety of stage effects . He also made changes to the music , importing a sound system and making bold use of local pop stars and Western music to accompany his plays . His golden-light theater came to dominate puppetry and he himself rose to the top of his generation of puppeteers .  
In this modernistic new musical , Gao Xingjian merges Chinese traditional speaking and singing arts with modern Western theater of the absurd to dramatize how , in the Tang Dynasty , the most famous of Chan koans ( paradoxical statements or questions which , when profoundly meditated upon , may bring the Chan practitioner sudden enlightenment ) became the basis on which power was transmitted from the fifth patriarch , Hungren , to the sixth patriarch , Huineng .  
Secondly , even today many people think that Chan is modern Japanese-style Zen . They have modernized and commercialized the performance of Chan . You can not say that this is bad , but Japanese place too much emphasis on formal ritual . At its inception Chan rejected formal ritual , and only in that way can you see the real profound significance of Chan .  
A courageous pioneer in literary style , even when he was demoted to governor of Chaozhou Prefecture , Han Yu brought his colorful lifestyle to that far-flung uncivilized southern realm , thereby displaying once again his ability to transcend worldly concerns of fame and fortune , and his characteristic willingness to uphold the values of a life of beauty and goodness . Perhaps this is a better reason for modern scholars to offer a stick of sweet-smelling incense in his memory .  
How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science . But when applied to medicine , perhaps this debate tells us that modern medicine should not completely exclude traditional and folk remedies , and that it may not be the only source of objective , universal , correct and valid knowledge .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
However , Professor Kim was well aware of Hsiao 's romantic temperament and tender nature ; his works have always abounded with vivid color and layer upon layer of beautiful , unforgettable melody . As a result , Kim reminded Hsiao that he need n't be a slave to modern music and its jarring dissonances , encouraging him instead to follow his own musical path .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
" Many people find that the up-close living arrangements of the past were painful for all concerned : the mother , the daughter-in-law and the son who was stuck in between , " notes Lu Lo , assistant professor of Department of Psychology at Fu-Jen Catholic University , who also has a positive take on modern views about filial piety .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
Yeh points out that ever since the May Fourth Movement of 1919 , the traditional principle of filial piety was deemed to be dogmatism . The principle of filial piety was connected to loyalty to the emperor and was thus authoritarian . In modern society , everybody is an independent individual , and so today we talk about relative filial piety .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
The heavily attended concert included both ancient and modern music . The " collective memories " exhibition , with pictures from Wufeng displayed on the exterior wall of the lower compound of the Estate , was very moving . The arts market , the tone of which was dominated by traditional and folk crafts , had a constant stream of visitors . Through this event it seems that the people of Wufeng reclaimed some of their happy memories of the past .  
My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
Nonetheless , when you push open one thick , heavy , lacquered door after another , you are welcomed not by some literary or historical figures of the Republican era , but by dazzling and brightly lit restaurants with spacious , modern decor in an " alternative " style .  
No matter whether modern or postmodern , classical or neoclassical , or an eclectic mix of old and new , restaurants in the " petty bourgeois " or " middle class " style are friendly , welcoming places , neither pretentiously modern in a cold and snooty way , nor self-consciously old school and superior . Taiwanese have long been good at creating this kind of atmosphere .  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
Against a background of undefined time and space , star character Su Huanzhen sometimes tricks others into thinking that he is dead or has surrendered . Clever , slick , and cunning , this kind of role-both good and bad , black and white-does not exist in traditional theater , but it certainly fits well with the values of modern viewers .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
As for questions raised by women 's groups , Shih Chao-hui , who also supports the pro-life position , acknowledges that facing up to the " realities " of abortion may indeed seem like a cruel thing to subject audiences to . And yet , she asks , are not modern terms such as " genetic health , " " termination of pregnancy , " and " induced abortion " simply linguistic traps designed to beautify the act of abortion ? A true view of the body  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

Because of the widespread and increasing use of commercial energy in all economic sectors of modern societies , various concerns have often been expressed about the adequacy of reserves and resources to meet future demand .  
The ultimate protection , however , lay in the legitimate exercise of Chamorro selfdetermination and the subsequent structuring of a political status conducive to their cultural survival and entry into the modern world in their own right .  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
The basic coordinate of Slovakia 's foreign policy is its integration into the geopolitical and economic sphere with which we not only have numerous historical ties , but also and , I think , more importantly with which we share the same hierarchy of modern civilized values .  
Moreover , with a view to building a peaceful , prosperous and modern nation , my Government has formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in the political , economic and social spheres .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
We , the leaders of the modern world , are faced with a great responsibility : we must be united and rise above our distinct personal , party and national interests , and seek the vision of a new world which will hold a future for every individual , every nation and State , for the universality of spirit and for the tolerance of the different .

On another subject , my delegation fully supports the proposals relating to advancing financial intermediation in Africa , as this is a way to strengthen local savings structures and to link them with modern banks and financial institutions , with a view to generating local resources at this time when official development assistance is dwindling at an unprecedented rate .  
Although there may still be many difficulties and challenges along the road ahead , we are confident that , through several generations of hard work , our people will lift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and turn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern country .  
In order to avoid even more serious and even catastrophic consequences for the rural environment and productivity , substantial increases in the use of fossil fuels for rural energy services will be unavoidable if modern renewable energy technologies can not make a major contribution to the rural energy mix .

Nevertheless the path explored by the reformist Arab writers of the nineteenth century should be pursued and legal principles elaborated capable of bridging the gap between various communities and modern public administration , a step which is needed for participation in the world economy .  
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
Now , when we commemorate the historic injustice of 55 years ago , let our thoughts not be overwhelmed by the memory of the nefarious characters , Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin , who together assumed grave responsibilities for some of the most horrifying acts of territorial rape in the modern history of Europe , but rather remember the great politicians , Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , the makers of the historic Franco-German reconciliation !

The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .

Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .

A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
Although the potential biomass resource base is immense and dedicated energy crops could add significantly to that resource base , modern , efficient use of biomass remains to be promoted and applied ; a small increase in the efficiency of burning fuelwood would have noticeable effects on carbon and particulate emissions .  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .

Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population .
