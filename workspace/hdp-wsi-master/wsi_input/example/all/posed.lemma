It should be recalled that the General Assembly , spurred on by the awesome threat posed by atomic weapons and by the disquieting prospect of a nuclear arms race , focused attention from the very beginning on questions of disarmament , and in considering the regulation , reduction and elimination of armaments , it adopted a number of principles , many of which have retained their validity and relevance .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .

Certain parties seemed to have adopted a selective approach to the Rio commitments , either because the threats posed to the global environment had been exaggerated or because a decision had been taken to ignore the dangers , leaving them for future generations .  Perhaps some considered that the problems were specific only to the third world , but that view was shortsighted .  
In post-emergency situations , a group which often became a major liability and risk to the precarious peace process was that of soldiers who had to be demobilized and prepared for reintegration into civil society ; that task posed formidable challenges to be addressed jointly with the United Nations system and other concerned parties .

The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
In my report of 1 October , I observed that the Haitian National Police had not reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups , and that it was clear , therefore , that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy .

Given that terrorism posed a stumbling block to worldwide social , economic and political development and was , moreover , a violation of human rights , concerted international efforts should be made to eliminate it .  
The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination .

An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .

The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .
