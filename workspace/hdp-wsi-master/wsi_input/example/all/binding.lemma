And the microbes in the soil which can dismember virtually anything are useless against them .

Farmland can not be sold to anyone who is not a working farmer , and few children want to take over their parents ' farmland .

Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations .

These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone .

With respect to persistent organic pollutants , proposals were advanced for the global programme to initiate , directly , an intergovernmental process to consider and negotiate a global , legally binding instrument .

While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .
