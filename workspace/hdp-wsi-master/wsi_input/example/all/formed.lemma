Among the nuclei , the diameters of the 11 larger ones range from 2 to 4 kilometers .  The explosion energy caused by these collisions will reach as high as 10-trillion tons of TNT dynamite , and equivalent to the explosive power of 500-million atomic bombs similar to those dropped on Hiroshima . A colossal fireball and soaring mushroom cloud may be formed in Jupiter 's atmosphere whose projectiles would be thrown to a height of several thousand kilometers .  
Oversupply refers to the excess industrial output capacity and product mix formed by years of blind investment and duplicate construction , as well as a staged surplus of farm products due to successive bumper harvests .  
Hard supply refers to the low-level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form .  Since our market lacks elimination-through-competition forces , with enterprises lacking innovative skills , this hard supply is not corrected promptly and effectively .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .

Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
They should establish as soon as possible a new dynamic social welfare administrative system and a lively operating mechanism in line with the requirements of the socialist market economy .  In addition , they should deeply reform the present social welfare organizations formed by the state and collectives , explore new ways to socialize the administration of social welfare , and see to it that all social welfare organizations are operating on their own , responsible for their own profits and losses , and marching on the road of self-development .

Although Uganda , in the highlands of East Africa , is separated from China by thousands of miles , there are striking similarities between the activities of the " Movement for the Restoration of the 10 Commandments of God " and the " Falungong " cult that had caused mass unrest in China : They both made up stories , engaged in deification , spread heresy , hoodwinked the people , formed secret societies , swindled money and accumulated wealth by unfair means , persecuted good and innocent people , showed contempt for human rights . . .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
Third , in April 1999 , the state decided to establish Xinda Assets Management Company , and in October the same year , three more assets management companies , Huarong , Changcheng , and Dongfang , were established .  They took over a considerable portion of bad assets formed by policy-related loans and those formed during the track-changing period so that the capital burdens of bad assets , which the state-owned commercial banks should write off or prepare to write off , have been lessened .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .

"  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .

However , due to the irrational international economic order formed long time ago , various countries do not have an equal share of the benefits of globalization , developing countries are in a relatively unfavorable position in the process of globalization , and the wealth gap between the North and the South has been widened further .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
However , owing to the irrational international economic order that has been formed for a long time , the benefits received by various countries in globalization are very unbalanced , the developing countries are in a relatively disadvantageous position in the process of globalization , and the gap between the poor and the rich and between the South and the North has been further widened .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
Cai stated : The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , namely , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , have formed the core of the international law in modern times .

Recently , while the US stock market was falling again and again , Taiwan 's stock market did not follow suit and even slightly rose .  The key for this lay in the existence of the mainland conceptual stocks formed by the Taiwan businessmen 's investment in the mainland , the opening of B shares on the mainland stock market , and the booming real estate market on the mainland side .  All these factors effectively played a role in supporting Taiwan 's stock market .  
Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .  
In this grand " strike-hard " struggle , public security frontier guards throughout the country have stressed their tasks in striking out at illegal migration .

As a result , the DPP government under Chen Shui-bian has the " multi-party coalition government " , and if there are contradictions among the various party factions on the one China or " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent nation " , no choice can be made , and no unified consensus can be formed .  So the enlightened coalition government trick will in the final analysis be only a struggle of private interests .  
The above two different early warning systems are known as " the air-based early warning system " and " the ground-based air target surveillance and tracking system " , respectively , with the former is formed mainly by the DSP satellite system , which is capable of sounding an early warning against an incoming missile , or its future replacement - - " the air-based infrared surveillance system " , and the latter by seven key early warning systems operated by the US Air Force Space Command and the US Navy Space Command , respectively . 
The system is also assisted by a higher-orbit surveillance system and a lower-orbit surveillance , with the former formed by four geostationary satellites and two large oval orbital satellites , and the latter comprising several perigean orbital satellites complete with a newly developed vital device called " target sensor " . 
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
However , no other political organization had so many progressive elements as our party gathered , and was organized so tightly as our party , and made so great sacrifices for the Chinese nation , and could maintain so close ties with the people .  The party formed and maintained its correct theory and line as it was good at summing up experience in the course of advancing .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .

It has created an equipment management network which connects all lateral units as well as all lower-level units and integrates departments at different levels .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .  They should take a step further and change their function from predominantly regulating country markets to regulating the unified national market and from managing the market by mainly relying on administrative means to managing the market by law .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .
