The theory of the " malignant / benign polarity " might sound reasonable enough , and the various traditional Chinese occult sciences based on it , such as geomancy ( examining this polarity in spatial terms ) or Chinese medicine 's concern with regulating cold and heat , may be backed by crystal clear logical argument .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue .
