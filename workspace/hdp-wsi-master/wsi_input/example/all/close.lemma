But heavy metals are inorganic materials , different from organic materials which can link up with carbon molecules . They are processed out of ores and originally have the special characteristic of close binding with the soil . They lack the mobility of organic matter and can stay in one place for hundreds or thousands of years . And the microbes in the soil which can dismember virtually anything are useless against them .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs .

"  
Fan Kang-lung , a young sculptor who has become well-known for carving eagles , says that humans always see eagles alone , never in groups .

She is faced with the barrier of being the manager and being labeled a " capitalist " ; it is not easy to build close friendships with employees .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market .

Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
Turtle BayIn the southwest of Green Island , there is much coral rock close to shore , and in the shallow water are many topographical features such as coral pillars , caves and archways . When the water reaches a depth of 6 meters or more , the topography is even more varied , with soft coral hills , surge channels and coral caves . Soft coral covers a high percentage of the reef , and the fish , shell fish and other animal activity is similar to what is found in Nanliao .

In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives .

Furthermore , comic dialogue by its very nature demands close attention to oration ( of poems , tongue twisters and jokes ) , imitation ( of various regional dialects , insect noises and bird calls ) and singing ( folk ballads , regional operas , and even pop songs ) , all bound up in a comical style .  
At the early stage of development , comic dialogues were close to being musical dramas . Some comic dialogue performers would put on extra little shows outside the theater to attract an audience . Other performers simply had a background in Peking opera and thus " stole " quite a few performance techniques . For example , they incorporated stage acrobatics and the vocal techniques of musical dramas , and even contemporary pop songs .  
" It 's hard to say . It may be that only close relatives were buried in the home , while ' evil spirits ' [ such as those killed in war ] might have been buried farther away from dwellings , " posits Liu . He adds , " Modern people always feel that people from the distant past were ' uncivilized . ' In fact , in terms of life rituals , it may very well be that they were more rigorous and clear-cut than moderns . "  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
Tall and handsome , young and enchanting , they nevertheless frequently go through an entire year without seeing the light of day . They sleep during the day and go out at night . They live only indoors , underneath light-bulbs , and for this reason , when one pays close attention to them , their faces always seem a little pale , their voices are scratchy , and faint bags can be seen under their eyes . . . .  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
By the close of business every day , the counter on which the organically grown fruits and vegetables are displayed is usually bare . Chen Chun-chun , CEO of Organic World , which he founded three years ago , says that Taiwan 's organic foods market is growing quickly ; annual growth is 20-30% .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
In order to create space and support in international relations , Vincent Siew has visited Southeast Asia numerous times since accepting the post of premier . During the financial meltdown , it became evident that in light of Taiwan 's close links to the financial system of Southeast Asia , we must at all times keep a friendly hand extended in that direction .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
A Miss Chou , who works for a publisher , recalls that when her mother-in-law was close to death , they shoved a thick tube down her throat to keep her breathing , which not only made it impossible for her to give instructions but also twisted her mouth into hideous shapes . It was such a contrast from her usual calm and peaceful visage , and made her look both scared and in pain .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
In Love in a Small Town , Wang intentionally avoids detailed description of the main characters ' backgrounds or their social milieu . She also keeps narrative comment to a minimum . Instead , the carefully constructed mood of her story conveys the process by which two minor actors-young , spirited and in close physical proximity every day-discover , through force of instinct , their sexuality .  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
Nine gorgeously plumed birds , each holding ripe , juicy berries in its talons , perch in the branches of a sacred bronze tree that stands close to four meters tall . Hanging from these branches are sea shells , a symbol of wealth . Perhaps the purpose of these decorations was to pray for wealth , or maybe the tree was meant to serve as a stairway to heaven . Every Chinese child today knows of the legendary tree that sheds coins whenever shaken .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
As his 90-minute concert was drawing to a close , the packed audience seemed entirely absorbed , as if hypnotized or intoxicated .

And Lien offered a new rendition of his song " When the Earth Calls Her Children Home " to console the wounded spirits of the September earthquake :  
During the time of Fan Kuan , artists were neither too close nor too estranged from nature . They neither made dull and painstaking objective facsimiles of the natural world , nor showered their work with their own subjective feelings . Cun and dian brushwork , which were born out of naturalism , would-after Fan Kuan 's day-be employed in works that were more and more subjective and abstract .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .

On a large antique-style cabinet in the waiting area , Sung arranged over 20 pieces of Chinese porcelain . These were imitation antiques which he bought in Taiwan 's pottery town of Yingko , but shortly after the restaurant opened they were all stolen by thieves who mistook them for genuine antiques . Convincing imitations Of all the Chinese restaurants Peter Sung has designed , a particular favorite of his is the Tse Yang Restaurant in the diplomatic quarter of Paris , close to the Champs Elysees .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
For Cegaw , winning an award for something so close to his heart and home is " something I 'll never forget as long as I live . " In fact , though members of the tribe were enthusiastic about participating in the competition , even Cegaw thought that many other sites were better , and that the chances of a prize were remote . Residents were astonished by the news that the site was named as one of the 100 to get through the preliminary round .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .

The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .

Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens .

After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
On the day of the French defeat , local residents subsequently ordained a ritual so as to pay homage to the ghosts of those who died so far from home .

Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .

In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair .

Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .

According to Cheng , research in Taiwan and abroad has consistently demonstrated that severe depression , alcohol and drug addiction , psychological instability and personality disorders , and suicidal behavior by close blood relatives are all clear contributing factors to suicide .

He then decided to abandon his wife , family and princely status , and cultivate the spiritual path .  
Other innovations have included introducing a truly three-dimensional feel and experimenting with molds . In the opinion of Hsia Yuan-yu , an expert on Chinese folk artifacts , Ch'en Hui-yen has transformed the ancient art of modelling dough figurines . She pays close attention to facial expression , physical structure , musculature , old clothing and hair styles , and even details such as eyebrows and eyelashes are painstakingly sculpted hair by hair .  
But while reliable evidence is still lacking for a rational explanation to many doubtful issues , Professor Endre Galla , head of the Faculty of Chinese at Eotvos Lorand University at Budapest , jocularly points out that the Hungarians , always isolated like outsiders in Europe , are themselves only too happy to believe that they might be the Huns who once trampled over the continent ; at least , they claim some fairly close relation to the Huns .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan . Add to this the local native style , and you could say that this is the most fortuitous event in the history of Chinese food since somebody figured out how to make fire from rubbing sticks together in ancient times .  
Going south along Hsin Sheng South Road past Hsin Yi Road , you pass the Chin Hua Girls ' Senior High and Taipei Mosque on the right , and on the left stretches the zone designated for the No . 7 municipal park . Here stands a row of car repair garages which , once they close down after dark , turn into a deserted oasis of darkness long familiar to Taipei residents .  
Their letter was earnest . The gist of it was that they felt close to the characters in my books and very much wanted to talk with me . . . . There was only a scattering of overseas Chinese in Europe 27 or 28 years ago , and the term " overseas Chinese community " was practically unheard of . As few as we were , under the shadow of the political climate of the time , we fell into two clearly defined camps , the line crossed only by a handful .  
It was just unfortunate that the manuscripts came to light at the height of the wave of enthusiasm among Western scholars for archaeological research in Central Asia at the end of the nineteenth century . With the chaotic Ching court possessing neither the means nor motivation to preserve the historical relics , close to half were bought - - or misappropriated - - by foreigners and scattered throughout the West .  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
What was especially " heterodox and rebellious " was that after the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937 he was determined to stay loyal to his ancestral homeland , remaining close to his fellow students from China and hoping to sneak into the mainland .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
Chinese ho-yuan could be connected together or divided up , " he explains . After a large family subdivides and each member forms his own family , one need only close the side doors of the rooms ; the main compound and the hulung , or auxiliary rooms set off to the left and right of the main com pound ( separated by an open-air pathway ) , can then become two independent bodies .  
But heavy metals are inorganic materials , different from organic materials which can link up with carbon molecules . They are processed out of ores and originally have the special characteristic of close binding with the soil . They lack the mobility of organic matter and can stay in one place for hundreds or thousands of years . And the microbes in the soil which can dismember virtually anything are useless against them .  
Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques . So if you want to improve the problem of soil pollution , the costs are exorbitant .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Plants are 90 percent water , and a thriving 100-year-old tree needs to replace close to half a metric ton of water lost to evaporation every day . Without an unending supply of water , a tree will be hard pressed to grow big .  
And they ca n't refuse these evenings out but must attend to them like their regular duties in the office . " At the same time as paying close attention to the course of the conversation between the two main parties , they also force themselves to try to be witty and interesting , so as to make the scene more festive , " says Li Tao , director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , speaking from personal experience .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
Fan Kang-lung , a young sculptor who has become well-known for carving eagles , says that humans always see eagles alone , never in groups . " Eagles are so often just a black speck high up in the sky , you can never get very close to them . They 're alone , distant and hazy , unwilling to be caught up in the troubles of everyday life , thinking that others can not understand their passionate , burning life . ' '  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Shen Hsiaoling observes that most salaried women have no lack of colleagues with whom they may chat . Housewives can have a leisurely talk with their neighbors , too , when they are at rest . But the boss wife is in charge of the company , and she spends most of her time together with the employees . She is faced with the barrier of being the manager and being labeled a " capitalist " ; it is not easy to build close friendships with employees .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Traditional looms , colorful aboriginal clothing , utensils woven from straw and bamboo , Tachia rushwork materials and products , batik made by mainland Chinese minority peoples , modern woven craft products showing rich creativity in materials and design . . . - - if you look closely at the exhibits in the Craft Center , you can discover how rich and how close to everyday life the world of weaving is .  
When the Republican Period began , Tan developed close relations with the Nationalist government , relying on his membership in the early revolutionary society Tung Meng Hui . With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
Insecurity follows like a shadowIt is ironic that larger factories often choose to close or move simply because they are large and successful : in order to protect the corporate image , they have to observe the Labor Standards Law and environmental regulations , so they have high operating costs ; also large enterprises occupy much larger - - and more valuable - - amounts of land .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
Turtle BayIn the southwest of Green Island , there is much coral rock close to shore , and in the shallow water are many topographical features such as coral pillars , caves and archways . When the water reaches a depth of 6 meters or more , the topography is even more varied , with soft coral hills , surge channels and coral caves . Soft coral covers a high percentage of the reef , and the fish , shell fish and other animal activity is similar to what is found in Nanliao .  
As these five ports were all close to the teagrowing areas of southern China , the supply of tea became abundant and uninterrupted , and after the Treaty of Nanking the huge stocks of tea held in London 's warehouses expanded so much as to become a worrisome burden .  
Santiago is a beautiful city in South America . Whether they come from distant lands like Taiwan , the US and Canada , or from countries close by , few visitors to Chile fail to extol the city . Its climate is pleasant , its fruit plentiful , its scenery lovely , and its people warm and polite . The nation is politically and economically stable , and the society is peaceful .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
Furthermore , comic dialogue by its very nature demands close attention to oration ( of poems , tongue twisters and jokes ) , imitation ( of various regional dialects , insect noises and bird calls ) and singing ( folk ballads , regional operas , and even pop songs ) , all bound up in a comical style .  
At the early stage of development , comic dialogues were close to being musical dramas . Some comic dialogue performers would put on extra little shows outside the theater to attract an audience . Other performers simply had a background in Peking opera and thus " stole " quite a few performance techniques . For example , they incorporated stage acrobatics and the vocal techniques of musical dramas , and even contemporary pop songs .  
" It 's hard to say . It may be that only close relatives were buried in the home , while ' evil spirits ' [ such as those killed in war ] might have been buried farther away from dwellings , " posits Liu . He adds , " Modern people always feel that people from the distant past were ' uncivilized . ' In fact , in terms of life rituals , it may very well be that they were more rigorous and clear-cut than moderns . "  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
Tall and handsome , young and enchanting , they nevertheless frequently go through an entire year without seeing the light of day . They sleep during the day and go out at night . They live only indoors , underneath light-bulbs , and for this reason , when one pays close attention to them , their faces always seem a little pale , their voices are scratchy , and faint bags can be seen under their eyes . . . .  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
By the close of business every day , the counter on which the organically grown fruits and vegetables are displayed is usually bare . Chen Chun-chun , CEO of Organic World , which he founded three years ago , says that Taiwan 's organic foods market is growing quickly ; annual growth is 20-30% .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
In order to create space and support in international relations , Vincent Siew has visited Southeast Asia numerous times since accepting the post of premier . During the financial meltdown , it became evident that in light of Taiwan 's close links to the financial system of Southeast Asia , we must at all times keep a friendly hand extended in that direction .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
A Miss Chou , who works for a publisher , recalls that when her mother-in-law was close to death , they shoved a thick tube down her throat to keep her breathing , which not only made it impossible for her to give instructions but also twisted her mouth into hideous shapes . It was such a contrast from her usual calm and peaceful visage , and made her look both scared and in pain .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
In Love in a Small Town , Wang intentionally avoids detailed description of the main characters ' backgrounds or their social milieu . She also keeps narrative comment to a minimum . Instead , the carefully constructed mood of her story conveys the process by which two minor actors-young , spirited and in close physical proximity every day-discover , through force of instinct , their sexuality .  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
Nine gorgeously plumed birds , each holding ripe , juicy berries in its talons , perch in the branches of a sacred bronze tree that stands close to four meters tall . Hanging from these branches are sea shells , a symbol of wealth . Perhaps the purpose of these decorations was to pray for wealth , or maybe the tree was meant to serve as a stairway to heaven . Every Chinese child today knows of the legendary tree that sheds coins whenever shaken .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
As his 90-minute concert was drawing to a close , the packed audience seemed entirely absorbed , as if hypnotized or intoxicated . Encouraged by the concert 's hostess , the total of the audience 's charity purchases combined with donations from concert sponsors Kinpo Electronics and Compal Electronics surpassed NT $ 6 million . And Lien offered a new rendition of his song " When the Earth Calls Her Children Home " to console the wounded spirits of the September earthquake :  
During the time of Fan Kuan , artists were neither too close nor too estranged from nature . They neither made dull and painstaking objective facsimiles of the natural world , nor showered their work with their own subjective feelings . Cun and dian brushwork , which were born out of naturalism , would-after Fan Kuan 's day-be employed in works that were more and more subjective and abstract .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
Jade has always been close to the hearts of the Chinese , and while glass was a glittering and translucent material in the West , inspired by precious stones of varying colors , in China it developed primarily as a jade substitute , having a soft , opaque texture .  
On a large antique-style cabinet in the waiting area , Sung arranged over 20 pieces of Chinese porcelain . These were imitation antiques which he bought in Taiwan 's pottery town of Yingko , but shortly after the restaurant opened they were all stolen by thieves who mistook them for genuine antiques . Convincing imitations Of all the Chinese restaurants Peter Sung has designed , a particular favorite of his is the Tse Yang Restaurant in the diplomatic quarter of Paris , close to the Champs Elysees .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
For Cegaw , winning an award for something so close to his heart and home is " something I 'll never forget as long as I live . " In fact , though members of the tribe were enthusiastic about participating in the competition , even Cegaw thought that many other sites were better , and that the chances of a prize were remote . Residents were astonished by the news that the site was named as one of the 100 to get through the preliminary round .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Outline : Some Amis who have come from Hualien and Taitung to seek work in the urban areas of northern Taiwan , but who can not forget their ways of living close to nature back home , have chanced to come together and settle on some unoccupied land behind Yuan Ze University in Chungli , Taoyuan County . Here over ten families work , fish , gather vegetables , chat and sing together . The contrast between their uncertain future and their happy-go-lucky attitude of living in the present adds a poignancy to otherwise amusing events .  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
" Independent , close to ordinary people 's hearts , vital , spring-flowering , sublimely pure and noble . " Students involved in the student movement of the late 1980s created a huge wild lily modeled on the Statue of Liberty , to symbolize the spirit of the Taiwanese student movement .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens . The cafe would be filled with movie-going students , some of whom would order a single cup of coffee and stay an entire afternoon , and whom the proprietors never felt right about asking to move on . After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
On the day of the French defeat , local residents subsequently ordained a ritual so as to pay homage to the ghosts of those who died so far from home . Regardless of whether the battle victims were from the mainland province of Hunan or from far-off France , all were buried within close proximity of one another , and received the same burial rites-an ending that is at once ironic and tragic .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
In an unexpected development in this connection , to escape debt obligations a major shareholder in a venture-capital firm who has close ties with the ruling DPP has alleged the existence of a complex network of interlocking party and business funds involving illicit kickbacks to members of several different parties .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy . In fact , this issue has caused a number of foreign manufacturers to close their operations in Taiwan and to relocate to mainland China .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
In order to better understand the English-language education conundrum facing elementary schools throughout Taiwan , Control Yuan members Lu Hsi-mu , Lin Shih-chi , and Yin Shih-hao compiled an investigative report entitled " Problems in Elementary School English Education " at the close of last year . In it they discovered that rural schools were quite often unable to hire accredited English instructors .  
Moreover , various specialized medical centers that formerly carried the ball for epidemic illnesses-such as the hospitals dedicated to tuberculosis , leprosy , and even sexually transmitted diseases-have been compelled by market forces to close or restructure . Though the general hospitals that have replaced them have state-of-the-art facilities , they do not have an adequate number of negative pressure isolation rooms with independent climate control .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital .
