Experts think that this rare and important astronomical phenomenon requires continuous global observation , and that China is located at an important longitudinal position between Japan and Europe , so , China 's observational material from is an indispensable and irreplaceable component in the international joint observation .  
It marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and North and South , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order . 
With regard to this change , Zhang Hongwei , who is here for the Third Session of the Ninth National Commission of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , says the following based on his experience : Confronted with the trend of global economic integration , our country should , from now on , encourage robust domestic businesses to make investments and establish plants abroad and explore international markets so as to gain an edge in the midst of increasingly sharp international competition .  
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties 36 years ago , friendly relations of cooperation between the two have maintained development on a healthy and stable track through the ups and downs of global situations and their domestic conditions .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
I believe that a healthy , stable , and friendly relationship between China and India is in the common interests of the peoples of the two countries and is also conducive to the global peace and stability .  The Sino-Indian friendship , diligently cultivated by the leaders of the two countries , will certainly continue advancing forward in the new century .  
When many people regarded " globalization " as an inexorable " objective trend , " a German academic soberly analyzed that the " close connection of the global economy is by no means a natural result , but the result of an intentional practice of a policy to chase the set objectives . "  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
He said : China is of the opinion that in order to resolve the issue of nonproliferation , first of all , it is necessary to establish a global security environment of stability , cooperation , and mutual trust .  Building a good international environment in which people adhere to peaceful means to resolve international disputes , and all members of the international community can enjoy universal safety will play a positive role in eliminating the motive of some countries to procure large-scale antipersonnel weapons .  
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
This will be the first summit meeting held between the north and the south since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 .  As a major breakthrough in north-south political relations , the summit meeting is expected to draw global attention .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed up the global strategic issues into four characters , " east , west , south , and west " .  He also defined the " north-south issue " , which reflects the gap between rich and poor , as a " core issue " .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
Both the traditional enemies and long-standing allies of the United States heaved a sigh as if relieved of a heavy load , praising the US president for deciding to shelve the NMD program and leave his successor to decide whether or not to deploy the system , which is regarded as a threat to the global arms balance , and saying that the president has made a wise decision which will avoid upsetting the global balance of power .  
The new sports section has two pages , which involves several columns , such as focus of the sports world , global sports events , straight reports on hot-spot issues , stars ' stylish bearing , and quick updates .  This section will offer in a timely manner detailed reports on major sports events and affairs at home and abroad and on things related to sports stars .  
The government has strengthened contacts and consultations with the United States , European Union , and some other major trade partners with an eye on securing a stable external environment for Macao 's export trade .  In the meantime , the government has also actively helped transform traditional industries and has ensured that Macao 's products will keep abreast with global development and remain competitive .  
From an overall perspective , China faces a good domestic and international environment for the development of foreign economic relations and trade next year ; global trade is expected to maintain a certain level of growth , and China 's domestic economy will continue to maintain fairly rapid growth .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
The Gulf War of 1990 became the first testing ground for America 's space weapons .  More than 70 satellites crisscrossed the skies over the Gulf , forming four major aerial systems : surveillance and monitoring , communications logistics , navigation and global positioning , and meteorological logistics .  A vast space network blanketed the skies over the Gulf , giving the Multinational Forces ( MNF ) divine-like guidance .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Qian Qichen said : China and the United States have important common interests and assume a heavy responsibility in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and world peace and stability , preventing proliferation of mass killing weapons and vehicles for carrying them , ensuring regional and global economic stability and prosperity , and coping with international threats .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
Wang Shijie stressed : In the new century , various countries should promote democratization of international relations and establish a new international political and economic order that is fair and just .  They should ensure that the broad masses of developing countries have the right to equally participate in the decisions on global economic affairs .  
The reason is : in a foreseeable period to come , there will be no major change in the international strategic structure , and there will be no major breakthrough in Sino-US relations .  The United States will not make substantive adjustment of its strategy against China . Taiwan 's status as a chessman in the global strategy of the United States will not be shaken , and Taiwan 's role as a counter will not be weakened .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
Over the past 20-odd years , ever since it was established , CITIC has witnessed relatively smooth development as it has benefited from a correct understanding or judgment of the global economic situation , and this is the key reason , and is inseparable from the work of the CITIC Consultation Committee .  
Immediately after the Bush administration announced in March that the United States would not execute the Kyoto Protocol , which is aimed at reducing the global emissions of greenhouse gases , most states and nongovernmental organizations in the world voiced strong discontent over the US move to damage the international community 's major environmental protection effort and demanded one after another that the US Government change its decision .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
Whether they are large or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , all countries should participate in global economic management on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and jointly create and defend a new international economic order that is just and equitable . "  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
After the 1980s , advanced technology has been used in conducting geological investigation and research , such as global satellite positioning , GPS monitoring system , and aeronautical remote sensing technique , which has led to the establishment of the datum net for GPS monitoring in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project , and GPS net for monitoring local deformity .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
Only when the majority of young officers and soldiers have a sense of urgency being aware that time waits for no man , making diligent efforts to become high-quality military professionals and striving to improve their own quality can they keep up with rapid development in the global field of military science and technology and genuinely fulfill their sacred mission of revitalizing the military and serving the motherland .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
In the four months since it took office , the Bush Administration has stirred up trouble everywhere ; from pushing the MD system heedless of the international community 's opposition , to refusing to implement the " Kyoto protocol " aimed at controlling global warming , and on top of that , gesticulating at the establishment of an independent defense force by the EU , the United States has practiced a kind of arrogant and selfish unilateralist policy . 
If the NMD plan were implemented , it would shatter global strategic balance and stability , damage mutual trust and cooperation among the world 's great nations , hinder international efforts to reduce and halt the spread of armaments , and touch off a new arms race .  
What should be even more highly shocking to people is that the Bian administration continues to confront the mainland by pursuing a line of " resisting reunification with weapons , " professing that he wants a " decisive battle outside the boundaries , " ordering a large number of advanced weapons from the United States , and actively coordinating with the United States to revise their global strategy , and acting as a willing pawn of the international anti-China forces working to " contain " China .  
In the past more than 100 days , it not only announced the withdrawal from the " Kyoto Protocol " aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas release , but also decided to break the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed before and deploy the national missile defense system that will break the global strategic stability .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
Shi Guangsheng : The Foreign Trade Minister meeting is an important routine meeting of APEC that is held once every year .  Ministers and officials of every member state hold discussions and seek mutual understanding on major issues impacting global and Asia-Pacific regional economic and trade development .  The meeting serves as preparation for the Joint Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministerial meeting and the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting scheduled to be held at the end of this year .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the important " three represents " ideology advanced by Comrade Jiang Zemin has answered from a political , economic , and cultural point of view the basic questions of what type of party to build and how to build it .  It has given expression to a distinctly advanced characteristic , a scientifically innovative spirit , a broad , global view , and a staunch purpose for party building .  
The meeting of ministers responsible for trade among APEC member economies and the discussions on major issues concerning regional and global economic and trade development are of major significance for the maintenance of a stable and open economic and trade environment in this region and the establishment of a fair and rational new world economic order .  
Not only is a new round of multilateral trade talks a major issue that concerns all countries today , but APEC 's 21 APEC member nations account for about half of world trade and half of the global economy .  Their voice has a decisive role on the international economic stage .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
At the time when the US economy is in recession and the depreciation of Japanese yen and Korean won has reduced the competitive edges of China 's exports , China 's economic officials and scholars maintain that devaluation of renminbi to stimulate exports and the economy is not likely in the foreseeable future , and that further expanding domestic demand and increasing investment and consumption remain to be China 's only correct policy measure for the present to cope with global economic slowdown .  
But recently , some subtle changes have occurred in the bilateral relationship : The US announced it would withdraw from the " Kyoto Protocol " to control greenhouse gas emissions and halt global warming , greatly displeasing Japan ;  
Only in this way can our Party when faced with fierce global struggles , tough challenges and crucial risks and when in battle in over such things as politics , economics , culture and values be permanently successful .  Only in this way can our country better protect its security and interests and develop in accordance with the planned objective .  
Hu Angang believes that , in a situation in which the rapid deceleration of the US economy is leading to a slowdown of the global economy , it is necessary to have an overall grasp and understanding of China 's present economic situation from the angle of historical development and a relative international perspective .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
She said : During the visit , President Jiang Zemin and President Putin will exchange views on a wide-range of current major and pressing regional and international issues , in order to make concerted efforts to safeguard global strategic balance and stability .  
Diplomats of the two countries disclosed that Jiang Zemin and Putin will hold a summit meeting to exchange their views on the current international situation , major global and regional issues , including the US claim to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its readiness to build the national missile defense system .  The two heads of state will reiterate their stands clarified during the " Shanghai Five " summit in June this year , namely , Putin stressed that Russia firmly safeguarded the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to prevent a new round of arms race ;  
As the statistics for various economic sectors are announced , the outline of China 's national economic development in the first half of this year is gradually becoming clear : China 's economic growth has continued to maintain a strong momentum amid the overall environment of weakening global economy .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
In order to further improve the global development environment , the developing and the developed countries should continue to promote reforms in the international financial setup , launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations , narrow the development gap between the developing and the developed countries , and work together to build a more fair and rational new international economic order .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .  
This development has rescued the " Kyoto Protocol " which is facing the danger of falling apart , has established operable guidelines for the protection of the global environment on which humans depend on to exist , and is of a great significance to improving the world 's climatic conditions and ecological system .  
As pointed out by a responsible official of the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee , press , publication , radio , television , and film industries should be committed to innovating the macro managerial mechanism , the micro structure , the market organization system , and the investment and financing systems , so that China can occupy an important position in the global media structure .  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
Through this window , people can feel that China , a country with a stable political environment , with an increasingly developed economy , with ethnic unity , with social progress and with increasingly greater overall national strength , stands in the East and is a major credit to maintaining global peace and development .  
The primary force driving Sino-US relations forward is that there are enormous common interests between the two sides on both national and global strategic issues and that these interests far outweigh the differences and contradictions between them .  
In the early days of his office , Bush put on the airs of a supercilious " global overlord " on the diplomatic front and met with extensive opposition from the international community .  It landed the United States in a very isolated state , incurring more and more criticisms and worries from within the United States . As a result , the support rate for Bush in the opinion polls kept falling .  
State Councilor Wu Yi indicated in a written speech : In facing the present new situation wherein China is about to join the WTO , we must take both Deng Xiaoping Theory and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " as the guide , adopt a more active approach in our participation in cooperation and competition on a global scale , and make continued efforts to push forward the practice of opening up in all directions , at multiple levels , and in a wide range of fields .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
" The Chinese People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] is a mighty , civilized , and victorious military force which has been ever-triumphant .  Moreover , after carrying out reform and opening up for over 20 years , China has attained outstanding accomplishments in facilitating economic and social progress which attracted global attention .  Consequently , China has very considerably enhanced its social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and national defense capability .

Consequently , China has very considerably enhanced its social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and national defense capability .  
US President Clinton recently submitted to Congress the national defense budget for fiscal 2001 ; the total amount of the budget is $ 305.4 billion , an increase of $ 16.5 billion - - 5.7 percent - - over that of fiscal 2000 ; the figure represents over one-third of total global military expenditure and is equivalent to the total expenditure of the eight countries ( regions ) which rank after the United States .  
President Putin of Russia and visiting President Clinton of the United States held talks on such issues as global strategic stability at the Kremlin on 4 June . The joint communiqu on principles of strategic stability signed by the two sides pointed out that the presidents of the two countries would work hard to strengthen strategic stability and international security and declared that in the future there would be further discussions on further reductions in the two countries strategic forces within the START III framework and continued consultations on the antiballistic missile issue .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
In his speech at a special session on social development of the UN General Assembly here on 28 June , Wen Jiabao , head of the Chinese delegation and vice premier of the State Council , pointed out that it is a long-term arduous task to bring about global social development and that unremitting hard work over a long time by the governments and peoples of various countries as well as the international community is needed .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
11 .  The two sides emphasize the importance of exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern .  They are willing to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and work to build a just and rational international political and economic new order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
11 .  Both sides emphasized that exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern is of great significance , and are willing to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation and to make efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the UN Charter as well as established principles of international laws .  
In answering the question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held by the Foreign Ministry today , Sun Yuxi said that China thinks the missile defense plan announced by the United States is not in keeping with the trend of the times , is harmful to the international efforts dedicated to arms control and disarmament , and will produce a harmful impact on global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
He believes : If the plan for star wars is approved , the consequences of global arms race will be very serious : It will undermine existing international agreements on arms and on destruction of nuclear weapons , including international treaties banning nuclear tests , treaties on reducing strategic weapons , and agreements on controlling and stopping nuclear weapons .  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
At today 's news conference held by the Foreign Ministry , Sun Yuxi , while answering a reporter 's question regarding the failure of the US missile interception test , said : The US development of the NMD system will break the global strategic equilibrium and stability , hinder the nuclear disarmament process , spoil the efforts of the international community on non-proliferation , and may trigger off another round of the arms race .  This is against the interests of all nations across the world , including the United States itself .  
The 1972 " Treaty on Restricting the Antiballistic Missile System " ( hereafter called the " ABM Treaty " for short ) still remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security and is the basis of key international agreements on reducing and restricting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao solemnly stated when briefing today on the Sino-Russian joint statement on the ABM issue that China and Russia both oppose the National Missile Defense [ NMD ] system , and appealed to the international community to continue to show serious concern regarding those countries which are vigorously developing ABM defensive systems that undermine global strategic balance and stability , and also take the necessary steps to prevent the development of this dangerous trend .  
He said , in this joint statement the two sides emphasize that the 1972 " Treaty on Limiting ABM Systems " remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security , and is the basis of key international agreements reducing and limiting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
The development of the NMD and the TMD is bound to undermine global strategic balance , lead to a new round of arms race , and produce broad , far-reaching negative impact on international peace and security , on the process of international arms control and disarmament , and on the international non-proliferation efforts .  Such developments are compromising the regional confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the regional security .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : When China and Russia , two friendly close neighbors , enhance cooperative ties , they will exert very strong impacts on global situations .  In the future , both sides should maintain contacts and coordination while handling major issues .  
and added an enchanting brilliance to the prosperity and development of the global economy .  China 's stable political situation , social security , and an economy that has always maintained a relatively high speed of development , are key to China 's achievements in attracting foreign business investments .  
What warrants people 's special attention at present is that as tough measures are unworkable , they are replaced by soft measures such as intervention in the name of humanitarianism , human rights overriding sovereignty , human rights prevailing over everything , and global intervention without boundaries .  
He said : Russia and China 's decision to establish a strategic cooperative partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] has been a historic and correct one in the interest of both countries .  It is conducive to regional and global peace and stability as well as to progress towards a multi-polar world .  
In order to contain the global offensive tendency of the Soviet Union which constituted the most important threat to the United States , in spite of the intense opposition of those pro-Taiwan forces within the US Congress , it established diplomatic relations with China at an ambassadorial level and meanwhile abolished the US-Taiwan " Mutual Defense Treaty " signed in December 1954 . 
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
According to the forecast of the UN Conference on Trade and Development in its annual report on global investment which was published a few days ago , once China enters the WTO and carries out the market economic reform stipulated by the WTO , it will trigger a new round of foreign investment craze in China , with the investment amount increasing from $ 40 billion a year on average at present to $ 60 billion , and even as high as $ 100 billion in future .  
The countries concerned should observe the treaty and other concluded legal documents on arms control and disarmament .  They should not develop or deploy the NMD system , which upsets global strategic balance and stability , nor should they assist other countries in acquiring such a system or interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and undermine their sovereignty and territorial integrity through the proliferation of sophisticated antimissile systems and technologies .  
The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
Once the NMD system is deployed , the results in bilateral and multilateral disarmament and arms control obtained over the past several years will be destroyed in one day .  With the destruction of global strategic stability , unilateralism in international relations will increase .  There will be more unstable factors in both global and regional security .  
As viewed internationally , just as the rapid development of the modern European and American countries brought by the sprouts of the capitalist production relationship and industrial revolution , the trend of world multi-polarization and global economic integration is increasingly prominent at present , the scientific and technological revolution in the world is advancing by leaps and bounds , and the knowledge-based economy has begun to show an inkling .  This has brought new opportunities and challenges to various countries , which , at the same time , are confronted with a new round of fierce economic competition .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
While the international community is facing daily increase in global problems , it is necessary for all countries , including China and France , to make concerted efforts and strengthen cooperation in protecting the environment and combating drug trafficking , illegal immigration and transnational organized crimes .  
He said : While globalization is developing rapidly , the global management system is obviously lagging behind .  There is an urgent need for the international community to formulate coherent and effective management strategies , conduct reforms on current global economic system , so that the system will represent the interests of the great majority .  Accordingly , it will be guaranteed that all countries , especially the developing countries , will be able to enjoy the benefits fairly brought about by globalization , so as to realize the goal of eliminating poverty and achieving sustained development .  
These objectives include : greatly increase the level of overall industrial science and technology and international competitiveness , so as to enable the technological level of China 's principal sectors of agriculture , industry , and the service industry , especially manufacturing technology and equipment , to reach the 1990s level of developed countries and some sectors to enter advanced global ranks ;  
Also , both China and Thailand are developing countries and both are facing the arduous tasks of developing our respective economies and improving our peoples ' living standard .  We hold identical or close viewpoints on many important regional and global issues .  
The broad mass of developing countries face the arduous dual tasks of not only having to exert great efforts to transform their traditional industries but also striving to develop new industries , or it will be hard for them to realize virtuous development of their economies and to deal with harsh challenges brought about by the development of the global economy . 
As a major power in the Arab world and Africa , Wu said , Egypt has played an important role in regional and global affairs .  Egypt has won widespread acclaim for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East region and the world at large , strengthening unity among the Arab and African nations , and promoting and developing common prosperity of the developing nations .  
In his speech at the meeting , Li Peng , chairman of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , pointed out that the convening of this grand meeting in China indicates that China 's tremendous achievements in the building of legal system have attracted worldwide attention , that law education and research in China have an increasingly extensive impact on the global affairs , and that the world is extremely concerned about the building of a socialist country ruled by law in China .  
Li Lanqing expressed deep belief that full advancement of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is not only in keeping with the basic interests of the two countries and their people , but is also beneficial to regional and global peace and stability .  
Economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , and is the new height and stage of this development , in which resources and social production factors are allocated in the most effective way on a global scale .  It represents the most advanced production mode and productive force hitherto seen in human society and will become the economic base of world peace , universal harmony , and the future new society of mankind .  
It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .  The waves of impoverished developing countries opposing the developed countries headed by the United States will certainly surge higher and higher , class struggle will move from a country to the entire world , and the era of peace and development will come to an end , which will be replaced by the new round of revolution and war on a global scale .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
Regional conflicts sparked by ethnic , religious , territorial , resource , and other factors have continued to break out ; all kinds of splittist forces , terrorist forces , and extremist forces have continued to compromise the international community ; environmental , drug , refugee , and other global problems have become increasingly prominent .  
First , before and after George W . Bush assumed office , he declared that the United States would promote a diplomatic policy based on a " unipolar world " and stressed the " leading position " of the United States . Meanwhile , he announced that the United States would adjust its global strategy and shift the strategic emphasis from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .  
The new US Administration recently increased defense spending by a big margin and has vigorously pressed ahead its NMD [ national missile defense ] program , drawing strong denouncements from the international community .  However , a small number of countries , such as Japan , have not complained at all about the US act to dominate the world , which will spark a global arms race .  Moreover , Japan has exerted itself in cooperating with the United States in developing a strategic missile defense system .  
" We lack a group of leading talented people who are capable of leading and directing in global science and technology , and we lack a large number of high quality operational and managerial talents who are familiar with market economic law . "  
If we want to occupy a position in the highly competitive field of advanced science and high technology and to put ourselves in a favorable position in global economic development , we must pay great attention to the issue of intellectual property rights , looking at it from a strategic angle , " said Xu Guanhua , CPPCC member and newly appointed minister of science and technology .  
It holds fast to the crux of China 's modernization drive at the beginning of the new century and fully embodies the global views and strategic thinking of the party central committee .  Hence , it is the basic guiding principle which we must understand and take advantage of in the future economic and social development of China .  
Following the Asian financial crisis , the United States saw that China 's image as a major power is developing in a " positive direction " and [ that China ] is a responsible and cooperative big power .  Enjoying economic prosperity and stability and the further elevation of its international standing , China occupies a rising position in the US global strategy .  Even US security and prosperity increasingly depends on the development of Sino-US relations .  
After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .  It is time for the United States , as the designer and protector for the security and economic order of the international community , to discard the diplomatic pattern of self-centered unilateralism and to rely on the coordinating and managing functions of multilateralism .  
" Against our free trade philosophy , the prime objectives of Hong Kong for the international trade forums are two-fold : first , to further the benefits of trade liberalisation with a view to achieving the global free trade and second , to maintain a rule-based multilateral trading system which is relevant and responsive to the needs of the modern business world , " he said .  
We are gathered here today for a common objective - international economic and monetary cooperation to achieve stable global development , prosperity and stability .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
We held an Environmental Awareness Seminar for our senior staff in the City Hall in October 1997 , enlisting assistance from external expert key speakers .  The purpose was to introduce to our staff the total concept of protecting the environment from global , regional , local and management perspectives .  
The challenge ahead is to promote shared growth , to forestall future crises , and to design a new international financial architecture that promotes resilient financial systems , efficient global resource allocation and a level playing field .  
" Today , television , personal computers and mobile phones have formed an integral part of our life .  Such advance in the communication technology has enabled us to keep abreast of the world within doors .  Looking ahead , with the rapid development of global communication and the Internet , it wo n't be long before the era when people can master the jobs within doors will come , " Dr Leung said at the brief handover ceremony .  
" I have maintained close contact with international business and financial leaders in order to have a better grasp of the current global economic climate .  I also explain to them the purpose of our policies , in particular those implemented and being planned for the financial markets . "  
He called for new rules and strategies to cope with the huge inflows and outflows of capital that are part and parcel of today 's global trading and investment environment as well as a new set of international guidelines to facilitate smooth , sustainable growth rather than boom and bust cycles .  
Talks focused on looming global economic problems , disparities between the speed at which financial markets have developed and the regulatory frameworks governing such activities , China 's emergence as a global economic power and its role as a stabilising factor within Asia , and the impact of the Euro on Asian and global financial markets .  
The Financial Secretary , Mr Donald Tsang , says there is a growing consensus among Hong Kong 's major trading partners that there needs to be ' quick and decisive ' efforts to deal with the current global economic and financial crisis .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .  
So , just as last year 's policy address set a visionary and positive tone for our future in the wake of an extremely successful transition , this year 's address was soberly precise in its analysis of the current situation , pragmatic in its approach to tackling our problems , yet forward-looking and responsible in taking some of the concrete steps we need to find a new niche for ourselves in an ever-changing global economy .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
As far as law enforcement is concerned , it is a very complicated global problem to enforce laws regarding the Internet . It is a problem law enforcement agencies throughout the world are very much concerned about , because effective investigation and prosecution of Internet-related crime involves many new concepts and complicated issues on computer technology , such as key escrow and decryption , interception of telecommunication , real-time monitoring , tracking of local and overseas electronic transactions , computer forensic examinations of local and overseas electronic evidence , etc .  
" Under the proposed regulatory framework , Lloyd 's will be subject to requirements applicable to other authorised insurers .  These include the maintenance of solvency margin and local assets , appointment of fit and proper representative in Hong Kong , proper regulation of its insurance agents and separate reporting of global and Hong Kong business .  
There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .  The theory is that , in a liberalised global financial system , international capital flows reward countries with sound economic policies and punish those which pursue unbalanced and inconsistent policies .  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
On the promotion of efficient functioning of global markets , Mr Trichet said that full and reliable transparency for all , including both public and private sector entities , would be the most effective measure for countering dangers arising from the " herd instinct " of market participants .  
Both exchanges ' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as proposed by the Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future development of Hong Kong 's financial services industry and that it will be critical to maintain and strengthen further Hong Kong 's position as a global financial centre in the increasingly competitive international securities and derivatives market .  
Topics covered during the 75-minute ABAC session included lessons from the Asian financial crisis , sustainable economic growth , accelerated trade liberalisation , APEC 's contribution to the WTO , the development of a policy framework to cope with a competitive global economy , the abolition of subsidies on food products within APEC and Y2K readiness .  
The latter is necessary for the efficient and effective future management of the projects , and for a continuous development of their respective area to keep up with the dynamic and competitive global environment , " he added .  
Financial liberalisation became very much the fashion , leading to domestic financial markets rapidly attaining a global dimension , welcoming and absorbing international capital .  
" The Advisers believe that Hong Kong is well placed to capitalise on its position as a global financial centre , given our strengths , quality physical infrastructure , resourcefulness of human capital and unique economic links with the Mainland , " he said . 
In the ensuing decades , based on the system laid down by the United Nations ( UN ) Economic and Social Council 's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , international codes have been developed and published .  These codes have been revised regularly to catch up with the technological developments and requirements of global trade .  
The Commission believes that these World Cities are major centres of global commerce because they have the economic structure , the hard and soft infrastructure , the institutions , the quality of life , the cosmopolitan and outward perspective and the relationship with their hinterlands that enable them to attract international capital , businesses and skilled individuals . 
Speaking on the control of strategic goods in Hong Kong , Mr Tsang stressed that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government , as an active and responsible player in the global economy , was fully committed to operating a law-based , transparent , stringent and internationally accepted system of controls on the trade of strategic commodities .  
" Local professional bodies , regulatory institutions and the government will monitor the development of the markets and take necessary measures to keep our regulatory regime up to date and abreast with the global trend .  Above all , we will strike a proper balance between the protection of the rights of investors and assistance rendered to the emerging enterprises so as to ensure that our financial industries will continue to flourish in the new economy , " she stressed .  
But as markets attained a global dimension , encouraged by financial liberalisation and the advance of information technology , they became far less tolerant of weaknesses than before , and the markets responded to weaknesses with harsh punishments , which many considered grossly unfair . 
This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
In the ensuing decades , based on the system laid down by the United Nations ( UN ) Economic and Social Council 's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , international codes have been developed and published .  These codes have been revised regularly to catch up with the technological developments and requirements of global trade .  
Hong Kong 's bid to host the Asian Games has greatly encouraged our athletes to work with untiring efforts to upgrade their skills and enhance the status of Hong Kong in the international sports arena .  It does not only greatly inspire our athletes and other members of the local sporting community to move forward , but also unites all sectors of our community to work with concerted efforts to achieve our common goal and to demonstrate to the global community our entrepreneurial spirit and vitality .  
Mr Tung said APEC Leaders had resolved to continue working in international forums to help shape the global economy and to provide a more secure and stable financial environment for developed and developing countries .  
In step with the global trend to open up the television market , we consider that the Government 's role should be to create an open and competitive market to promote the development of the broadcasting industry .  The Government should , as far as possible , refrain from intervening in the market , such as imposing mandatory requirements on domestic pay television programme service licensees to provide a channel to broadcast the programmes produced by the RTHK or the cultural presentations organized by the LCSD .  
This seven-year full-time programme , to be offered from 2001-02 , will produce medical graduates with a sound understanding of both Chinese and western medicines to meet the global need for development of an integrative medicine based on modern scientific concepts .  
But to stay ahead in the increasingly competitive global knowledge economy , we must continue to upgrade our education system , improve our living environment , beautify and green our city and speed up urban renewal , so that we not only have quality people , but also quality homes to meet rising expectations as society advances . 
Each year we determine according to economic growth projections , the total amount of money likely to be available for ongoing projects and new projects ready to start in the coming five years .  Within this global figure , we exercise control over the funding of individual projects through the Government 's annual resource allocation system , under which we take account of the planned programme and the projected annual cash flows on each project for the five-year planning window .  
At the annual meeting , member jurisdictions discussed a wide range of issues , including economic implications of money laundering , global anti-money laundering initiatives and the regional response , APG mutual evaluations , and current and future typologies work on money laundering methods .  
" The new arrangement aims to attract Mainland students who had completed their bachelor degree or higher level studies in Hong Kong in 1990 or afterwards to re-enter here for employment .  The ultimate aim is to build up a critical mass of quality personnel so as to enhance the competitiveness of local companies in the knowledge-based global economy with a view to facilitating the economic development of Hong Kong , " she added .  
( The Hang Seng Index fell further to 11 316 on 30 August , affected by lacklustre performance of the major stock markets overseas amidst a dim global economic scene . )  
Mr Leung said : " The global financial system remains under stress , given large external deficit of the US , extended deflation and weak banking system in Japan , significant correction in major equity markets , more volatility and misalignments in exchange rates , and problems in key emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey . "  
Following complex , protracted investigations into two separate global drug trafficking syndicates , the hard work and co-operation established between representatives of each agency involved finally bore fruit with the confiscation of drug trafficking assets totalling over HK $ 83 million from Hong Kong financial institutions .  
I look forward to the positive response and commitment of the community as a whole , in particular , parents and the business sector towards improving the quality of the local workforce so that Hong Kong would become a real knowledge-based economy and Hong Kong 's competitiveness on the global front may be enhanced . "  
We are washed by the same body of water and we are pretty much all in the same boat .  This is some boat .  The 21 member economies of APEC are home to some 2.5 billion people ; represent 44% of global trade ; and in 1999 had a combined gross domestic product of US $ 18 trillion .  
" As stated by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address this year , the Government is fully committed to providing a conducive environment and the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the development and promotion of Hong Kong as the preferred international and regional transportation and logistics hub , as well as a base for coordinating and integrating service providers for the global and regional demand and supply chain , " Mr Leung added .  
Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
We look forward to playing a more active role in contributing to the sustained growth of China , both as a source of investment and as a partner to overseas firms looking to strengthen their presence in a country set to become a key engine of global economic growth . 
The gloomy global economic outlook amidst wary over a protracted US economic slow-down , and the successive waves of US corporate profits warnings , pushed down share prices worldwide .  The local stock market was likewise hit .  
Then the 911 incident aroused widespread anxieties in the global financial markets , causing the Hang Seng Index to plummet to a near three-year low of 8 934 on 21 September , 14% down from the pre-911 closing level .  
Also speaking at the opening ceremony , the Commissioner for Labour , Mrs Tan Kam Mi-wah , said : " The theme of today 's workshop is ' Developing decent and sustainable youth employment ' .  The theme was set in response to the ILO 's global policy of developing decent work for the youth , and is in perfect accord with the concept of lifelong learning prevailing in Hong Kong . "  
On the second point , the answer is that we have not conducted an assessment on the subject raised by the Hon Chan Yuen-han .  The reason is that the commercial decisions of enterprises , including whether and when to move a business or certain production processes elsewhere , are always subject to a wide range of factors .  These would include the prevailing global and domestic economic climate , the market conditions of individual trades , as well as the adequacy of manpower supply and operating costs .  
The conference will review the progress of key tasks under the Regional Strategic Plan and identify the way forward for advancing the region ' work on co-operation and mutual assistance .  There will also be discussion on a number of issues being pursued at the global forum of the WCO , such as anti-cigarette smuggling measures , and efforts to strengthen Customs mutual administrative assistance .  The conference will also discuss stepped up Customs measures to combat international terrorism .  
CNBC , the foremost global provider of business and financial information and TNT , the world 's leading business logistics solutions company , today ( May 23 ) announced the launch of the Asia Business Leader Awards 2002 , the prestigious annual honour that recognises achievement , innovation and leadership in regional business .  
" As the trusted global advisor with a long and rich history in servicing the world 's most influential and successful entrepreneurs , corporate executives , and families , The Citigroup Private Bank is pleased to be identified with the Asian Business Leaders Awards for the second year running .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
Since its inception by the WHO in 1980 , the ICDRA represents a very important and unique global forum at which national drug regulatory authorities from amongst the members states learn of international tendencies , discuss current issues , exchange point of view and draw up recommendations .  It also offers an unparalleled opportunity to promote collaboration between developed and developing countries .  
" HK has maintained its advantage .  It still possesses a lot of competitive edges .  It is where opportunity , creativity , and entrepreneurship converge .  It is a dynamic , physical and cultural hub with world-class infrastructure , Asia 's most strategic location , and a global network of talents with an impressive record of success that can support the achievement of individual 's goal , and objectives " , he said .  
The meeting , to be held on September 5 and 6 , will focus on ways to strengthen global economic growth , combating terrorist financing and money laundering , advancing fiscal and financial reforms , and improving the allocation of domestic savings for economic development .  
Apart from its high speed , the launch is equipped with advanced equipment , such as differential global positioning system , maritime radar , echo sounder , night viewer , portable search light , mobile phone and facsimile machine etc .  
" For effective regulation , the SFO provides flexibility in addressing changing market practices and global conditions by empowering the SFC and relevant authorities to prescribe detailed and technical requirements as necessary by way of subsidiary legislation , " a Government spokesman said .  
He noted that Hong Kong , as the world 's top container port and a member of the international community , had played an active and responsible role in meeting various challenges to maintain the smooth flow of containers around the global supply chain and to enhance the security of global maritime trade , citing Hong Kong 's action in response to the US 's Container Security Initiatives ( CSI ) .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
In this era of globalisation , as the world 's freest economy and a premier international finance , shipping and business centre , Hong Kong maintains constant exchanges with other economies and major cities around the world .  Many of these have become our steadfast business partners .  These global connections are crucial to Hong Kong 's future .  We must push ahead in this direction to reinforce our global market network .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
In Mexico , for example , 12.5 square meters of forest are burned for each 11 kilograms of formula produced . Waste from the cows creates vast amounts of methane , adding to global warming . It requires a great deal of energy to manufacture dry powdered milk from the original milk . Packaging requires the expenditure and waste of large amounts of tin , aluminum , and plastic ; for example in the U . S . 550 million empty formula tins are discarded annually , while Taiwan throws away about five million .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
As international boundaries become increasingly blurred and the global village becomes a reality , working or living overseas no longer seems unusual . Yet families divided in this way have to confront the risk of dramatic upheaval or even disintegration .  
From the international perspective , the global economy has been dragging along at a low ebb for some years now . There have been many reports of layoffs , salary cuts , and plant closings , even for established multinational giants . It was only in the middle of 1994 that light showed at the end of the tunnel , and the turnaround that is making everyone so pleased only really began then .  
As official agencies and renowned international economic think tanks release optimistic forecasts for 1995 , an American economist , Ravi Batra , has struck an independent note . As the title of his book The World Great Depression suggests , he predicts there will be a global economic disaster in 1995 .  
A new seaborne celebrity : teaFrom the astonishing beauty of 16th-century blue-and-white ware to the strange and gaudy ware of the 18th century ; from the curio cabinets of kings and nobles to the luxury dinner services of the middle classes , Chinese export porcelain captivated Europe for several centuries . Did the Europeans really never think about " technology transfer , " instead sticking respectfully to the ideal of a global village with a " global division of labor " ?  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
The international success of the Swedish group Abba , who were contemporary with Teresa Teng , just goes to prove to what extent the English language has become the exclusive medium of the global pop-music industry over the last thirty years , a phenomenon matched equally by its unrivaled position as the language of science and technology .  
We want to guide the new generation to understand their homeland , love their country and develop a broad international perspective . Thus fortified , they can better meet international challenges and map out a bright future for their country in an increasingly competitive global village .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) . This replaced the former system of multiple exporters , and introduced a unified approach to the business , with global coordination covering every stage from improved cultivar selection to production , packing , cool storage , transport , shipping , overseas distribution , marketing and promotion , " says NZKMB new project manager Stuart Abbott .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation . But rapid planting of single-species forests in previously cleared areas implies that in the future , each such area will contain only one producer species , thus limiting biodiversity and creating incomplete and fragmentary food chains .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
The rapid ascent in the late twentieth century of the " 3C " industries-the capital - and technology-intensive semiconductor industry ( ICs ) , computer component production and assembly ( PCs ) , and electronic consumer goods ( ECs ) - has given Taiwan a strong hand in terms of global economic competition .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
A turning point was reached two years ago , however , as the global Internet infrastructure began to mature . Increasingly available broadband connections offered dramatic improvements in speed , and online games began proliferating . Ever since the wave broke over Taiwan , the number Internet cafes has been growing rapidly .  
In fact , " freak " Typhoon Nari seems very much to fit the trend of climate change . Liao Chung-ming , director of National Taiwan University 's department of atmospheric sciences , says that with global warming , extreme and unusual weather patterns will occur with increasing frequency .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
In this crucial period of a strategic realignment of global political and economic forces , Taiwan needs to increase its opportunities for international exposure and actively participate in international activities , in order to make its voice heard . Only in this way can Taiwan truly manifest its national status and dignity .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
Consequently , over the last 100 years , the poles have seen an increase of 5 �X C in their average temperatures . Hence accelerated melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is one of the first symptoms of global warming . But climate can not be separated into discrete regional units .  
As a result , a region that once had a very dry climate might experience frequent rains , or an area once known for its rains might cease to see any rainfall whatsoever . Under the influence of global warming , all kinds of strange meteorological phenomena might occur , including extreme cold alternating with extreme heat in one locale .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
" For a decade or two now , researchers in other countries have been taking notice of the boost that global warming can give to disease vectors , " says Professor Wang Chiu-sen of the graduate institute of public health at National Taiwan University . The list of diseases that may be helped to spread by climate warming includes viral diseases like dengue fever , yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and parasitic diseases like filariasis and schistosomiasis .  
On the first day of TIBE President Chen Shui-bian delivered remarks at the opening ceremonies . In addition to welcoming the publishing professionals from the various countries , he emphasized that a global knowledge-based economy was now in full swing , that the creation and utilization of knowledge would be the key to competitive failure or success for countries and industries . He said the government would incorporate the " knowledge industry " into the national guiding objectives and that the publishing industry was the foundation of the knowledge industry .  
Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management . " Although this is difficult to implement-even more challenging , in fact , given the need to maintain competitiveness amidst a global downturn-it is essential .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
We witnessed how homeless people at Lungshan Temple died of cold when cold fronts swept through at Western New Year 's . The next day , the news was flooded with stories of celebrities and the details of their elegant New Year apparel ; even as frigid corpses lay in the street , the consumerist priorities of the global economy held sway , and only the goings-on of the rich were on people 's lips .  
The purpose of the WHO is defined as helping people in the entire world to enjoy the highest possible standard of health . Its main responsibilities are to offer leadership and coordination on matters related to international health , to provide technical assistance , and to promote measures to prevent epidemics , regional diseases , and other illnesses . In addition , the environment , women 's issues , food safety , and global pharmaceuticals standards also fall within the purview of the WHO .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
It was for these human rights and medical goals that the international community established the WHO . So when over 190 countries around the world fall under the protective umbrella of WHO , yet the 23 million people of Taiwan are excluded , this is not only unfair to Taiwan , it also represents a weakness in the overall global healthcare structure .  
There are signs that the international community is gradually seeing the light on this issue . If the global community comes around , then this will naturally lead the PRC to revise its way of thinking . We can only hope that with economic development , growing diversity in society , and democratization , the mainland will also move toward a more reasonable and civilized position on this issue .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
In cross-strait economic relations , this included replacing the " no haste , be patient " policy with the " active opening , effective management " policy designed to facilitate corporate global planning .  
Wu explains that the high-tech industry peaked in 1999 going into 2001 , but after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 , the global economy went into a deep recession . To make matters worse , the dot-com bubble burst in the United States , investors suffered loss after loss in the stock market , consumer spending fell , and prices continued to decline , resulting in what economists call a deflationary economy .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin . Taiwanese have always prided themselves on their adaptability and nose for the latest in global trends , but in an age in which even industrial technology comes and goes in the blink of an eye , even the most agile individual is likely to find him - or herself buffeted by time 's waves into unforeseen directions .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
In particular , since the 1970s , with universal education and the rise of individualism and feminist consciousness , the younger generations have grown accustomed to living for themselves , and are wary of entering the " trap " of marriage ; while factors such as extramarital affairs , infertility and mental illness , along with changing employment patterns due to global competition , leave those who do marry in a constant state of anxiety , never knowing when the citadel they have toiled to build may collapse around them .  
Kuo then set up the artkey company . Using the then-new medium of the Internet as an art gallery , he staged the " SohoArt " Internet art exhibition and a " Top100 artworks " national artwork poll . He also set up a global Chinese arts directory and invited 100 artists to participate in a major exhibit over the Internet , giving artists , who previously had kept a respectful distance from technology , a real opportunity to get on the web .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
Because of strong support from parents and schools , not only has there been a quantitative increase in the number of players , but a clear qualitative increase as well . Since the first breakthrough in 1999 when Chen Chin-feng signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the US , over the past several years international talent hunters have scouted more than 15 of Taiwan 's top players , and Taiwan has become a main center for the development of talent for global baseball .

" We are ready to make efforts for greater global economic growth , but we are firm on not sacrificing our national interests in undertaking any international economic cooperation , " Jiang said at a welcoming luncheon hosted by the China Britain Business Council , stressing that this is a basic prerequisite for China on the issue  
The expansion of transnational corporation activities world wide calls for adequate governmental response , which , in the successful pursuit of national policies in an interdependent world , requires a global view .  
Indeed , the promise of global peace and security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by political and ethnic conflicts , economic and social disorder , and deepening poverty , particularly in developing countries .  
We have shouldered our responsibilities in this regard and have played an active role in international discussions to find a workable and balanced solution to global warming based on proven scientific evidence .  
In this case , pressure from the international community , including its global and regional political bodies , and the persistent efforts of certain internal and external groups led to a series of negotiations without precedent .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into at Rio was based on providing developing countries with substantial new and additional resources to meet their huge sustainabledevelopment requirements .  
Sustained and accelerated economic growth in developing countries would make for global ecological sustainability and should be central to development efforts at the national and international levels .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
Effective action at the global level was crucial in preventing and controlling the accumulation of illicit profits and in contributing to the impoverishment and weakening of criminal organizations .  
Today , spurred by concern over the potential for global warming and acid precipitation , coal is often criticized as a major source of environmental degradation at the local , regional and global levels .  
In this process , it was crucial to go beyond the limits of a technical exercise and to develop a process marked by shared ethical values where individual goals must be reconciled with global solidarity .  
With reductions in international and regional tensions , and with the growing recognition of global economic and environmental interdependence , the opportunity to mobilize human and financial resources for global problemsolving has never been greater .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
A provisional network of national focal points has also been established , representing all global regions and serving as a base on which to build the international response capacity to environmental emergencies .  
The future of coal as a major fuel is problematic , mainly because of environmental concerns at the local , regional and global levels over its contribution to local pollution , acid rain and climate change .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and to include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into during the recent years was based on the provision to the developing countries of substantial , new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .

At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
The objective of the satellite network proposal is to provide reliable , economic and secure international telecommunications services , capable of supporting global operations 24 hours a day , seven days a week .  
In the interests of social and economic development at the global level , the international community must not forget the victims , once it had addressed the urgent political dimensions of such conflict .  
There was vast potential in the huge and sprawling machinery of the specialized agencies which could enable the United Nations to take the lead in a new global compact on social development .  
The Assembly should focus on the development of norms , standards and rules of the game required to manage global interdependence in a rapidly changing international environment and promote an integrated approach to economic and social development .  
At the intergovernmental level , it had become widely recognized that the drug problem could not be tackled on a unilateral or even a bilateral basis but , being global in nature , would require extended and improved international cooperation .  
Organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
First , they took adequate account of existing , proven regulations under international law , in line with the objective of creating as comprehensive a system as possible of mutually complementary global and regional regimes for international watercourses .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
The root causes of global conflicts had been aggravated by ethnic , religious and intercommunal divisions , which required a just and lasting radical solution in order to ensure that desperation and insecurity did not lead to insurmountable social crises .  
He referred to the recent visit to China by the SecretaryGeneral who not only pointed out the critical role of international peacekeeping in promoting global security but also the vital importance of sustainable social and economic development .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
" In making social issues a universal priority " , as the Secretary-General pointed out at the recently held World Summit for Social Development , " our intention is to take responsibility for the collective future of international society and to pledge ourselves anew to the ideal of global solidarity " .  
At every level local , national , regional , international and global there is an awareness that the United Nations , for all its setbacks , is recognized for having done so much , so well and in such a short span of time .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
While the United Nations can not realistically manage all the crises occurring world wide , because of its unique role and responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security , it should seek to strengthen global political consensus on the principles of the Charter , assist , through its preventive capacity , in the formulation of regional strategies and efforts and take decisive action when regional or global security is seriously challenged .  
Geographically located near the so-called golden triangle , Thailand has consistently supported , at both the global and the regional level , international efforts aimed at the prevention , control and suppression of narcotic drugs .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In this changed world that came out of the Second World War more global and interdependent Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the vital role played by the United Nations in the preservation of peace and in solving the main problems affecting the world , and it wishes to confirm the validity of the enlightened principles of the Charter , as sound today as they were 50 years ago .  
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
These include the corrosive influence of drug production and consumption , and the corrupting effect of the movements of vast amounts of money that this traffic involves ; the degradation of the environment , from its global impact on the ozone layer to its local effect on the health of children and the elderly ; the large international migrations resulting from insecurity in the countries of origin ; the expansion of international terrorism ; and the increase in transmissible diseases such as AIDS .  
We believe that one of the essential tasks for the United Nations in striving to attain the goal of increasing global stability is to promote the progressive establishment in various parts of the world of regional zones of peace and cooperation that is , geographical areas , defined by the participants themselves , in which are applied agreed rules for coexistence and the strengthening of peace and security .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
While the first half of the twentieth century has left in the mind of mankind the haunting memories of two dreadful world wars , in the second half of this century , despite the fierce local wars that have taken place such as those in Indochina , Korea and Viet Nam nations have been spared the horrors of a global conflagration .  
The achievements of its foreign policy provide a new impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process of regional and global integration , and to participate more effectively in global forums and institutions , with a view to tackling the pressing problems facing all mankind , and to contributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of the international community to achieve peace , national independence , friendship , cooperation among States and development .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
It is but a means to an end , and it will only be meaningful if we are united in the view that a strengthened and revitalized United Nations is an imperative , given the inescapable reality of today 's global village ; that the world of the future will need more , not fewer , effective international collaborative mechanisms to confront common threats ; and that the United Nations remains the only available instrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle these challenges .  
Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are to trample through our region each year ; yet climate experts have given us notice that the phenomenon known as global warming will generate a greater number of extreme weather events , more ferocious and monstrous in each succeeding year . 
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
We hold that serious thought must be given to devising a suitable arrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our global community in its rich diversity and that is amenable to periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes in a dynamic world .  
The celebration in a few days ' time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will mark the Organization 's coming of age , and will also be an opportunity to lay the foundations for forms of international cooperation free from the ideological confrontation of the past , and directed firmly towards global challenges .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
In the current thinking about the necessary reform measures , it is vital to keep in mind the reality of the dynamic change in the global economic and social spheres , the ever growing importance of market forces and the global nature of the changes .  
Today 's world dialectically combines within itself both dangers and threats fraught with instability and the risk of new global shocks , while nourishing the growth of an essentially new and different non-confrontational system of international relations .  Through ever more active multilateral efforts in confronting common challenges , we see more clearly the basic principles of such a system .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
Far from accepting this situation as our fated lot and aware that we must rely on our own efforts , this year the African countries adopted , in Egypt , the Cairo Programme of Action , which aims at ensuring the immediate relaunching of Africa 's economic and social development through political and economic reforms and a global and coherent strategy .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
The timeliness of launching a global movement to ensure prosperity for all in this era of rapid globalization of economic activities was noted at the World Summit for Social Development , held in Copenhagen . In Sri Lanka , the Samurdhi programme is designed to activate the entrepreneurial potential of the poor . 
They also underlined the necessity to reinforce the efforts and the measures directed to safeguarding the observance of human rights , in particular those related to education and work , calling on national , regional and international organizations to support the global development of the young generation under the sign of understanding , progress and friendship .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Here I would like to echo the proposal made by President Ben Ali , Chairman of the OAU last year , for a global economic and social plan aimed at ensuring the development of Africa on a sound and lasting basis , helping our continent overcome its shortcomings and become integrated into the world economy and ensuring dignified conditions of life for all the peoples of the continent .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .  
The establishment of a conceptual link between disarmament and development by giving an impetus to more accelerated progress on the issues of global development will strengthen the roots of international peace and security and preserve the spirit of understanding , constructive cooperation and genuine political goodwill which are essential for the building of a better and more secure world . 
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it . 
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
National development policies must be designed to promote economic growth , social justice and concern for the environment ; at the same time , the international community must establish more equitable economic relations , bearing in mind the importance of protecting the global environment .  
For that reason they firmly supported the establishment of a global partnership which addressed all human rights and recognized that the universal enjoyment of human rights was hindered by the crushing debt burden and by structural adjustment programmes .  
Strengthen information , systematic observation and assessment systems for environmental , economic and social data related to land resources at the global , regional , national and local levels and for land capability and land-use and management patterns ;  
Such regional cooperative mechanisms could be facilitated through public / private partnerships and provide support to Governments , industry , non-governmental educational institutions and other domestic and international organizations , and by strengthening global professional networks ;  
Invites the working group on the agenda for development to give consideration to the proposal of the Secretary-General that advantage be taken of the presence of high-level representatives during the early part of the sessions of the General Assembly to conduct a dialogue and to convene special sessions of the Assembly on major themes relevant to the current and emerging economic and social issues in the global agenda , including those identified under the agenda for development ;  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;  
A projection of collective and global resource requirements , presented by the organizations to their respective governing body , based on approved and planned programmes , taking into account the needs of developing countries , their absorptive capacity , the themes and programmes of action agreed at world conferences and other forums , and the ability of the organization to deliver the proposed programmes ;  
In particular , the global POPIN Coordinating Unit and the regional Population Information Networks are working towards harnessing the tremendous potential of print , audiovisual and electronic media , including databases and networks , to disseminate technical information and to promote and strengthen understanding of relationships between population , consumption , production and sustainable development .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Encouraging the production of relevant studies / research to assess the consequences of global and technological changes on social integration and the production of evaluations of the policies and programmes put in place to achieve the various components of social integration ; and encouraging national and international exchanges and dissemination of information on innovative models and successful practices ;  
The following major levels of planning and management need to be distinguished : global , regional , national , provincial or district , local , municipal or village , and household or farm .  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 1994 / 51 of 3 November 1994 , in which the Council emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as women 's particupation in the peace process , in national and international governance , sustainable development and gender equality ,  
A coordinated global effort is necessary to consolidate the data available in a compatible form , and to obtain a greatly improved base of information , so that a much more detailed and precise understanding of the desertification issue can be obtained .  
Many species , such as migratory species , species dependent on the timing of ice-melting , Arctic communities , marine , coastal and peripheral populations , genetically impoverished species , mountain and alpine communities , and species that inhabit dry lands , semi-arid and arid ecosystems , are all likely to be adversely affected by global warming ; the climatic changes predicted may bring about catastrophic losses in genetic resources and species and ecosystem diversity .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Commission supports international and regional networks on in situ conservation areas ; ex situ base collection under the auspices of FAO ; the organization of a fourth international technical conference on the conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources ; and the establishment of the new global information systems for plant genetic resources and seed exchange based on the ongoing Seed Information System .  
Emphasizing that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
The international debate is increasingly concerned with how to reconcile national development objectives with such global environmental objectives as ameliorating climate change or conserving genetic pools to a degree that is often well beyond the needs of individual nation States .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly the developing countries ,  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
Taking into account that the Economic and Social Council , in its resolution 1994 / 51 , emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
Recognizing that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action is of particular significance as it will provide an opportunity to the international community to set out new and corrective policies and measures , including strengthened external support to the least developed countries in all areas , to support their efforts so as to ensure the timely , effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade ,  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
The primary objective of this programme area is to provide assessments of the current status and trends in major developmental and environmental issues at the national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
National plans and investment in science should further global environment and developmental observing systems and should strengthen internationally coordinated scientific programmes on environment and development involving relevant United Nations bodies and major international scientific bodies .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
It welcomed the active cooperation of the Statistical Division , the regional commissions and various international agencies , as well as national statistical offices , to promote , in a harmonized manner , the implementation of regional and global comparisons , and full-scale and reduced information surveys , and to explore the use of purchasing power parities for aggregation .  
Through various national , regional and global level expert consultations and conferences that involve the public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations , FAO has been increasing the awareness of the challenges and opportunities of modern biotechnologies at various levels .  
However , they were divided on the future role for UNEP ; the majority were in favour of a continued and enhanced role for UNEP and argued that environmental action demands that complex issues cutting across sectors be monitored from a global environment perspective .  
Recommendation 7 , Access to scientific data : UNEP should promote through Earthwatch a global policy of enhanced availability , within the framework of United Nations mandated programmes , of existing environmental data at the national or international levels so as to facilitate the delivery of environmental management tools intended for country decision makers .  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
In addition , the United Nations system , in coordination with other relevant organizations , is asked by Agenda 21 to provide recommendations for harmonizing the development of indicators at the national , regional and global levels , and for incorporating a suitable set of these indicators in common , regularly updated , and widely accessible reports and databases , for use at the international level , subject to national sovereignty considerations ( para . 
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
In the light of current global realities , it is important and timely to reverse this trend and to renew efforts to ensure that the two concepts become more closely linked at an operational level .  
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
The Division is also entrusted with the follow-up activities related to major regional and global programmes and provides advisory services on the administrative mechanisms for environmentally sound exploitation and utilization of natural resources , population policies and programmes and environmental conservation management .  
At the national level , United Nations resident coordinators are actively participating in the preparatory activities for the Conference and are assisting in promoting South-South cooperation on urban management at the regional and global levels .  
An international symposium on sources of innovation in multilateralism was held , in cooperation with the University of Lausanne , Switzerland , in May to re-examine the nature of global changes and the challenges posed to the United Nations , including its reform proposals , as well as emerging new social forces such as women 's movements , endogenous peoples , human rights activists and others . 
The symposium , held in April and attended by more than 300 scholars , diplomats , NGO representatives , religious leaders , and journalists , addressed issues of peace and security , development , environment , and shared universal human values and norms that go beyond the concept of international cooperation in the " global neighbourhood " .  
Parliamentary documentation .  ( i ) Four reports to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on the extent and developments in illicit traffic , with statistical and descriptive material , and analysis at the regional and global levels ; and ( ii ) contributions to the reports to regional meetings ( subsidiary bodies of the Commission ) on trends in illicit drug trafficking ;  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
In view of the increasing challenges before the Organization and the imperative to communicate effectively and with clarity the evolving message of the United Nations , the Department of Public Information , during the biennium 1994-1995 , sharpened its focus on selected key issues of global concern to Member States , established stronger links with diverse media and other redisseminators around the world in order to reach wider audiences , and improved programme delivery .  
The resource growth is attributable to ( a ) acquisition of the specialized automation equipment required for development of local area network in the Department under the responsibility of the Information Support Unit ( $ 55,000 ) , and ( b ) additional requirements for replacement of existing equipment of the Department under the global programme of technological innovations ( $ 113,900 ) .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to provide the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and other legislative bodies with systematic analysis and assessment of current global economic issues and trends and of their interrelations and implications for international and national action .  
UNDP-supported preparatory work for the World Summit for Social Development has involved country-level briefings , workshops and special events ; enabling the production of national reports and position papers ; and active participation at regional and global conferences on the core subjects involved .  
It urges Governments and major groups , as well as relevant international organizations and the scientific community , to participate actively in strengthening Earthwatch as an international partnership to ensure an adequate flow of information on the global and regional environment , to support decision-making and to give early warning on the state of the environment .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
The Commission noted that participation in the pilot phase is voluntary and that activities implemented jointly should be compatible with and supportive of national environment and development priorities and strategies , contribute to cost-effectiveness in achieving global benefits and be conducted in a comprehensive manner covering all relevant sources , sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases .  
The Commission notes with concern that the growing recognition of the need to address patterns of production and consumption has not yet been matched by a full understanding of the implications of such patterns on economic , social and environmental conditions at the local , national and global levels .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
To meet these challenges , and on the basis of our common recognition that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people , as well as of States , are addressed , we will :  
UNDP had encouraged resident coordinators to strengthen and establish thematic working groups on HIV and AIDS and to ensure their effective functioning ; invited JCP / UNAIDS and its co-sponsors to attend UNDP training workshops ; participated actively in global - and regional-level activities to develop a strategic plan of action for JCP / UNAIDS ; and was working with staff of JCP / UNAIDS responsible for developing the programme 's approach at country level .  
Considers that , in the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the Territories in question in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) , 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions ;  
This particular crisis , within a specific geographic location of strategic value and interest to the global strategy of the United States , linking United States efforts in the Viet Nam war , in which Australia was an active participant , prompted an obvious super-Power reaction , precipitating the integration of East Timor with Indonesia , in the total absence of Portugal .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .  
" With such political , economic and social developments , the Republic of China on Taiwan has a strong desire , and sufficient capability , to reciprocate for what it has received from the international community , and to fulfil its international responsibilities in order to contribute to global peace and prosperity .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .  
They concluded that additional staffing was essential to provide the level of management services required for the investment of assets as large as those of UNJSPF , to sustain the global network of direct custodial relationships which have been established , and to enhance the investment decision-making process .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .  
Review existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
The uncertain global economic climate has been accompanied by economic restructuring as well as , in a certain number of countries , persistent , unmanageable levels of external debt and structural adjustment programmes . "  Fifth sentence .  
Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
Further proposed action included the development of a holistic normative framework to facilitate the cooperation of all concerned in meeting conflicting demands on land resources while avoiding land degradation , as well as the negotiation of regional or subregional cooperative agreements on mountains , possibly leading to the development of a global mountain charter and action plan .  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
The meeting reviewed the global observances of the Year and their implications for national social policies in the process of sustainable development ; considered concepts and forms of international cooperation on family issues , with particular emphasis on assistance to developing countries ; and identified strategies and recommendations regarding national , regional and international follow-up to the Year .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Through its normative and field programmes at the global , regional , national and local levels in assessment and monitoring of land resources , policy and planning assistance , development and transfer of technologies , capacity building and demonstration in agriculture , livestock , forestry , fisheries and rural development .  FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , each organization should set out the specific actions they will undertake , including goals and targets to realign priorities and redirect resources to meet the global priorities identified in the Platform for Action .  
Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced , wars of aggression , armed conflicts , colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation , civil wars , terrorism and [ extremist violence ] continue to plague many parts of the world .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
It is unacceptable , and particularly deplorable at the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , that the central instrument for international cooperation on vital global issues is practically bankrupt , owing to the failure of Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full , on time and without conditions .  
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
It was further suggested that the end of the cold war , the growing integration of the world economy and the emerging consensus on development policies seemed to have created a propitious confluence of forces in favour of a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue designed to meet the global challenges of poverty and development in a rapidly changing international environment .  
NULLThe themes should be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue : to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
The experience gained over 30 years demonstrates the utility of free and unrestricted exchange of information through a dedicated global means of communication linked to individual national technical agencies .  
NULLWhile there is no comprehensive international programme for the early warning of geophysical hazards , there are some internationally acknowledged technical facilities or national agencies which collect , analyse and disseminate information regarding global seismic and volcanic events .  
NULLReview existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
Although the extent of information supplied varies , comparability within broad analytical categories has been accomplished and the system has proven effective in monitoring the drug situation at the national , regional and global levels .  
In practical terms , this means raising the level of consciousness about the problem at both the global and the national levels , stimulating dialogue among all concerned and facilitating cooperation between national and international actors .  
38 The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective , affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented .  
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
We want to generate broad support for an improved global multilateral system , based upon a renewed political will of all Member States , and which draws on the energies and the commitment of independent organizations of civil society .  
The Secretary-General supports this approach , which should be aimed at enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the United Nations in the performance of its functions and its ability to address the most urgent tasks and new demands , as well as to ensure an efficient and effective United Nations system capable of dealing with the growing number of global challenges in the economic , social and related fields . 
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
In order to secure global peace and prosperity , it was essential to close the widening gap between the developed and developing countries and to ensure that development was equitable and sustainable .  
With respect to persistent organic pollutants , proposals were advanced for the global programme to initiate , directly , an intergovernmental process to consider and negotiate a global , legally binding instrument .  However , much of this legal development may focus more within the broad field of chemical safety .  
The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
IMO and UNCTAD have joined in a search for solutions , and now consider that the most feasible approach would be to focus on individual ports , with some aspects handled at the national , regional or even global level . 
Recognizes that a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries will have a substantial impact on sustaining the strength of the global economy and will greatly contribute to efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The root cause of global environmental degradation lay in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption pursued by developed countries and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change had , quite rightly , set forth common but differentiated responsibilities for change . 
The net decreases in resources for the economic and social areas which had been noted by some representatives represented significant one-time expenditures approved in 1994-1995 for the major global conferences that had taken place during the current biennium .  
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
El Ni �� is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru ; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions , including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States , and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia .  
Through the use of space remote sensing systems , worldwide awareness of ongoing deforestation in the Amazon region was growing , and national policy and decision makers were becoming convinced of the need to react to such dramatic changes , which were degrading the regional environment and had serious implications for the global climate . 
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend , as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations .  
At the level of the United Nations and its agencies , the strengthening of the capacity of the system to support an integrated , effective follow-up to the Fourth World Conference as part of the overall effort to ensure the coordinated implementation of the results of the series of recent global conferences should be a key objective in pursuing further the ongoing reform process .  
Regional meetings to prepare for the mid-term global review were organized by the relevant United Nations regional commissions in accordance with paragraph 4 ( c ) of General Assembly resolution 49 / 98 , and the substantive inputs provided through the preparatory process at this level were transmitted to the Donor-Recipient Meeting in May-June 1995 and to the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting itself . 
Australia was a founding member of the International Coral Reef Initiative whose aims included promoting education programmes , improved coastal management and coordinated research and monitoring at the global , regional and national levels to ensure that coral reef resources were managed in a sustainable fashion .  
Since emissions of pollutants into the environment , including toxic and hazardous wastes , originated primarily in the developed countries , and since the latter 's unsustainable consumption and production patterns continued to be the major causes of the deterioration of the global environment , developed countries should take the main responsibility for protecting the environment .  
Certain parties seemed to have adopted a selective approach to the Rio commitments , either because the threats posed to the global environment had been exaggerated or because a decision had been taken to ignore the dangers , leaving them for future generations .  Perhaps some considered that the problems were specific only to the third world , but that view was shortsighted .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
It will also provide the international community with a wide and diverse database on solutions to some of the world 's most pressing social , economic and environmental problems and contribute directly to the implementation of the national and global plans of action by providing new ways and means of sharing and transferring know-how , expertise and experience .  
Such reports might , for example , highlight the progress made in formulating new global development strategies or policies , international development cooperation , the promotion of popular participation and social justice and the simultaneous promotion of full respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,

Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
forthcoming Conference was part of the continuum of United Nations conferences that had begun at Rio , a continuum that was rewriting the economic , social and , perhaps , political agenda of the international community for the twenty-first century and was providing a more holistic and humane message about global problems and the solutions they required .  
States members of the European Union looked forward to the adoption at the Conference of a statement of principles and a global plan of action which promoted sustainable development through a participatory approach , reflected the positions of all involved in the negotiations and clearly set out the political messages on choices that must be made to meet the challenges at hand .  They reaffirmed their commitment to that objective .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
His delegation believed that the international community should take strong and concerted action against terrorist groups which focused on economic targets with the potential to create environmental hazards , since such environmental damage could have global repercussions .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt servicing-problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
was important to recognize that security was no longer defined as it had been in the cold war era : security was currently threatened by socio-economic problems - massive migrations , global epidemics and environmental degradation - which could only be resolved in the interest of all countries by multilateral action .  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,

Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;

Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
considered that the main cause of the serious financial situation of the United Nations , which required a global and balanced solution , was the fact that certain Member States lacked the political will to discharge the binding financial obligations which they had assumed upon subscribing to the Charter .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
In doing so , we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented contribution , which has not yet received adequate recognition by the international community , to diminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful , consistent and reliable policy .  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
The ever-dwindling natural resource base , global warming , persistent droughts and desertification are eloquent reminders that humankind 's current destructive processes of growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
Our Organization , which was designed to respond to both global challenges and to the needs of its Member States , will not be able to play its double role in the coming century unless it can count on a sound , solid and stable financial basis .  
Belize has proposed that we should establish an annual special session of this Assembly immediately prior to the general debate , at which we would discuss development policy and regenerate the political will necessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for Development and the commitments made in this Assembly , as well as at the high-level global conferences of this last decade of the twentieth century .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
Tunisia 's steadfast efforts to consolidate the foundations of the country 's political institutions and the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights in their global dimension flow from a civilized , irreversible choice made in accordance with universal values .  
In this context , the Sultanate of Oman , as a developing country , has been looking forward to receiving the global support and assistance which , under the generalized system of preferences , the international community extends to developing countries to help them address the challenges posed by economic reforms and structural adjustment .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
They should , inter alia , pave the way for the active and global participation of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , in the work and procedures of the United Nations , including the Economic and Social Council , bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these countries in the economic and social challenges facing today 's world .  
With the new global changes , with our recent adoption of the CTBT , with rising optimism regarding the Conference on Disarmament , with what can be perceived as a genuine desire for peace , and with more meaningful international collaboration in the areas of economic cooperation and development , there is some hope for achieving lasting peace and security in our world .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
Intensified cooperation on their part with the United Nations system at the global , regional and national levels in the area of economic and social development would be most desirable to ensure coherent development efforts to produce fruitful results .  
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
With its unique approach , the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was aimed at renewing the commitment of African countries and the international community to an agenda for the sustainable social and economic development of Africa in a spirit of global partnership based on shared responsibilities .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
The participants in the Forum supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November , which would be marked by global exchanges of television programmes focusing particularly on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchange .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
The UNEP contribution will also include , depending on the availability of funds , establishment of regional expert panels to develop suitable classification systems and to evaluate the accuracy and utility of national , continental and global data sets being developed under land-cover characterization studies .  
FAO concluded that such surveys , if continued over time , would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis .  
Within the framework of its inputs to ongoing and planned global environmental programmes such as GTOS , FAO will continue its cooperation with organizations within the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other international organizations by providing remote sensing expertise and by participating in pilot studies in areas within its mandate . 
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment , as well as climate monitoring and medium-range , long-range , seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction .  
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
The international community has already defined a number of indicators relevant to reproductive health , and WHO is working on additional qualitative and quantitative indicators for global monitoring ;  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
In fact , the application of light detection and ranging ( lidar ) instruments was considered an extremely promising new way of obtaining essential atmospheric and geophysical parameters on a global scale .  
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development : ( a ) the back scatter lidar , with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology ; ( b ) the differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) , which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity , temperature and pressure ; ( c ) the Doppler lidar , with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies ; and ( d ) the ranging and altimeter lidar , which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth 's surface features .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
To support standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
[ We believe that attaining these goals will promote a world more stable and free from injustice and conflict and contribute to just , comprehensive and lasting peace and to global equitable economic and social development and environmental protection . ]  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
Undertaking the valuation of the goods and services of a forest at local , national , regional and global levels is a complex and costly exercise that must be carried out in response to specific demands and guided by the type of decisions for which the results are to be used .  
This approach provides the necessary base for moving towards sustainable land-use systems within which forests are clearly recognized as an option with its own validity in contributing to sustainability at local , national and global levels . 
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
A specialized forum should be established , possibly within the United Nations system , to discuss the range of mobile and fixed communications applications that could support the new national and global economic policies and to provide integral solutions aimed at specific economic sectors . 
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
Although there was a growing interest in mobile communications , their development would depend on the evolution of important factors , such as technological progress , the availability of orbital positions ( for geostationary satellites ) , spectral bandwidths , costs and performance to satisfy a wide range of applications and the capability to provide truly global services .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
This has been accompanied by increasing concern for the environment , and notable improvements in specific fuel consumption , primarily driven by economic considerations , resulting in lower emissions of CO2 ( currently estimated at 3 per cent of the global total ) and particulates than would otherwise have occurred . 
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions , a global average of one third ( varying by region from one seventh to two thirds ) of the existing global forested area is likely to undergo a change in broad vegetation types , with the most changes occurring in high latitudes and fewer in the tropics .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
Prices of internationally traded goods ( measured in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) ) are expected to change only marginally over the short term , as productivity increases , trade is further liberalized and competitive forces ( including in commodity markets ) contribute to keep global inflationary pressures at bay .  
This continuing rise in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases poses potentially substantial risks to global physical and ecological systems , human health and socio-economic sectors .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Agence for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law by the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
In the same resolution , the Secretary-General was requested to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money-laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The requested oral report on the preparation of a plan for the integration of existing information on mineral resource potential collected by the United Nations system , other organizations and Member States , on an ongoing basis so as to develop a global understanding will not be presented due to the lack of necessary resources available to prepare the plan . 
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
The Working Group recognized - as stated in the Washington Declaration adopted by the Conference - participating Governments ' intention to act to develop , in accordance with the provisions of the Global Programme of Action , adopted by the Conference , a global , legally binding instrument for the reduction and / or elimination of emissions , discharges and , where appropriate , the elimination of the manufacture and use of persistent organic pollutants that had been identified in decision 18 / 32 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .  
The Group recognized - as stated in the Washington Declaration adopted by the Conference - participating Governments ' intention to act to develop , in accordance with the provisions of the Global Programme of Action adopted by the Conference , a global , legally binding instrument for the reduction and / or elimination of emissions , discharges and , where appropriate , the elimination of the manufacture and use of persistent organic pollutants identified in decision 18 / 32 of the UNEP Governing Council .  
In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
It emphasized that the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility for developing and developed countries , as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , should be applied in any development of measures to protect the atmosphere on a global scale .  
Global statistical surveys and methodologies for data collection and the development of indicators , especially for use at the national level , are crucial for comprehensive and uniform data collection from which global trends can be identified , which are in turn the basis for intergovernmental policy recommendations .  
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
The evolution of the relative shares of each of the most important sources of energy in total global consumption , the dynamics of structural change in the global energy system , and the relative shares of different primary energy sources in global primary energy show that it took about half a century before coal was replaced by crude oil as the dominant global energy source .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
Both sides believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to formulate an Agenda for Development based on General Assembly resolutions and hope that the conclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development will help the international community achieve the objective of sustainable development , contribute to the economic growth and social development of the developing countries and promote international cooperation and global development .  
Provided effective support to standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
The general orientation of this programme is to promote more effective international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice by devising strategies to deal with global problems and by assisting Governments in their national and multilateral efforts to respond to changing crime trends , as well as to create the necessary instruments and institutions for a more accountable , transparent and effective crime prevention and control system .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
In order to develop the regional capabilities to foresee effectively upcoming trends and challenges , the fourth objective is to facilitate monitoring and assessing of new development processes and their projections , including summaries of major projected global trends in aspects that are relevant to the region .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
The main focus of the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Department of Public Information , is to raise global awareness of Africa 's critical economic situation and of the actions taken by Africa and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the continent .  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
In order to support the new global and integrated approach to human rights based on the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which emphasized the interrelated and interdependent nature of all human rights , it will be necessary to organize both short-term and long-term training in the various dimensions of human rights to ensure that all staff and those joining the Programme enjoy a broad knowledge of human rights from the United Nations perspective .  
Regional development and global changes included published studies on the impact of the single European market on ESCWA countries ; privatization in the Gulf countries and in Arab countries with more diversified economies ; and on industrial strategies in the ESCWA region within a changing international and regional environment .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and microtopographical data of the Area ;  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
The preparation of such a diagnostic framework would enable each country to undertake its own analysis of the conditions specific to it ; it would allow a wide range of national factors to be taken into account , particularly the interaction of different sectoral policies , and a nation 's international obligations ; and it would draw attention , where appropriate , to those circumstances in which global or external influences were important as driving forces of change . 
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Countries to contribute to periodic forest resources assessments by ( i ) nominating a focal point for cooperation with the FRA secretariats and ( ii ) providing , on a continuing basis , the information needed for the regional and global forest resources assessments , irrespective of whether it originates from official or unofficial ( expert estimates ) sources ;  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
The basic NFP principles recognize the following key elements ( see document E / CN . 17 / IPF / 1996 / 8 ) : national sovereignty ; integration with a country 's sustainable development strategy ; partnership ; participation ; a holistic and intersectoral approach ; a long-term iterative process ; capacity-building ; policy and institutional reforms ; consistency with national policy frameworks and global initiatives ; awareness-raising ; and harmony with national and international commitments .  
To achieve an overview of the relevance of existing international legal instruments to the conservation , management and sustainable use of all types of forests and their relation to issues on the global forest agenda , the present report provides a comprehensive summary of multilateral instruments that are relevant to forest use and conservation .  
While the global Secretariat relies on its existing staff to carry out its established work programme and implement the various mandates entrusted to it , it does occasionally experience the need for supplementing established staffing resources on a short-term basis to respond to specific mandates or requests from Member States , or to meet the demands of peak periods in areas subject to sharp and often unpredictable workload fluctuations .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The full value of forests , wooded lands and trees and their contribution to social , economic and environmental well-being at the local , national , regional and global levels must be recognized .  
The accords , commitments and internationally agreed targets reached at United Nations global conferences and United Nations organs , in the multifaceted and interrelated issues of the environment , population , social development , crime , the advancement of women , human settlements , trade and development and public administration should be fully implemented by all States and international organizations .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
Since it may be easier to negotiate and implement , country certification may not only lay the groundwork for more comprehensive international forest product certification agreements but also buy time , by initiating immediate incentives for action on sustainable forest management while the details of more complicated agreements on certification for all global forest products from natural and plantation forests are concluded .  
At the 1996 meeting of the group of seven major industrialized countries held in France in June , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States issued a final communiqu calling upon all States to spare no effort in securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines .

Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
Third , the multilateral system should be strengthened ; in that regard , the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , to be held in Singapore , would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Mr . MWAKAWAGO ( United Republic of Tanzania ) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair : hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future , and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty , especially in developing countries , which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership , unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated .

It was in its endeavour to take up the challenge of providing these people with their basic minimum energy needs that the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , in a broad-based partnership with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , international organizations and concerned governmental and non-governmental organizations , launched in 1993 a global initiative : a three-year-long communication process known as the World Solar Summit Process .  
The Programme is conceived as a necessary global commitment and a major coordinated effort of the various national and international actors to develop and implement more than 300 top-priority renewable energy projects of national , regional and international value within a 10-year period in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility , economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar energy .

At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
Professor Bert Bolin , Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , referring to the paragraph in the Summary for Policy Makers in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC in which it was stated that " the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate " , said that the paragraph in question had been agreed upon after an extensive discussion and very careful consideration by governments , in view of the importance of the key finding for policy makers . 
It is further recognized that such improvement of the quality of emission data , in addition to improving the transparency and comparability of national emissions inventories , also improves knowledge of the relationship between global emissions and resulting atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , and therefore aids significantly the task of estimating the emission limitations or reductions required to achieve a given concentration level of greenhouse gases , the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention .

"  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
In general , his delegation was satisfied with the priorities identified in the Note , but agreed with other delegations that both the disarmament issue and the question of effective and coordinated response to global issues such as drugs , crime and the environment , should also be considered as potential priority areas .

The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Nonetheless , the ] [ The Panel was convinced of the necessity of having a set of criteria and indicators wide enough to be used at the global level , rather than a reduced core set that might prevent the mutual recognition of regional and national initiatives , the exchange of information and the further elaboration of the issues of best forest practices and voluntary codes .  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
Through the series of global conferences on interlocking economic and social issues , the United Nations has been providing an ongoing democratic process through which a new international consensus on and framework for development can be built .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
The international community should call for the establishment of an international non _ governmental organization _ World Women 's Watch _ which would prepare country _ by _ country reports on key aspects of legal discrimination and on progress towards gender _ related targets fixed by national Governments and international forums ; promote the creation of ombudswomen at national and global levels to facilitate women 's access to the legal system ; encourage legal literacy campaigns to make women aware of their legal rights and to encourage them to study law through the generous provisions of scholarships ;  
Also , both the Teledesic Corporation and Sky Station International declared that they would provide some of their telecommunications capacity free of charge to developing countries , meaning several regions and countries would have free access to some of the fastest communications available for health or educational purposes .  NULLBecause of the tremendous advances in telecommunications technology , a new global community is emerging .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
These conferences provided a starting point for a global effort in advancing sustainable development , set goals and defined broad plans of action that provided the basis on which national and international actions could proceed .  
It is indeed commendable that this Japanese initiative is not restricted to Africa , but also includes the evolution of a new development strategy responsive to the present international development climate , and is providing the motivating force for a concerted global effort .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
Many times during the biennial conferences held since 1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that use French as a common language one country out of four in the world have recognized the role of multilateralism in the new international context and confirmed their will to help find a solution to global political and economic problems .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
It describes the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 51 / 18 of 14 November 1996 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .  
The main objectives of the Andean Community are to promote the balanced and harmonious development of the member countries on an equal basis through integration and economic and social cooperation ; to accelerate economic and social growth and generate employment ; to reduce vulnerability to external factors and to improve the position of member countries in the global economic context ; and to strengthen subregional solidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of development among its members .  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
We have stressed on numerous occasions , including from this rostrum , that the global confrontation between two systems has given way to equally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry within them the potential for enormous destruction , thereby posing the same global challenge to international security .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
My predecessor , the late President Cheddi Jagan , challenged the international community on many occasions to strive for a new global human order , a development paradigm which would seek simultaneously to achieve optimal economic growth , social equity , poverty reduction and protection of the environment : a development model rooted in a partnership that seeks a better balance within and among States .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
With this positive landscape in international relations and expectations , the United Nations embarked upon a series of unprecedented global conferences addressing key issues facing mankind , ranging from environment , human rights , population , social development , women and human settlements to food security . 
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
National strategies of economic reform and international cooperation must incorporate strong concern for the social implications in order to enhance the positive and minimize the negative effects of the global economy .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
The required data included the entire cross-border activity of firms , including trade in goods and services ; investment , both outbound and inbound ; and an indication of the relationship of the firms involved in such activity , such as affiliated firms operating as part of a global production network versus arms-length transactors .  
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Some other issues that will require increased research activities in the future are related to ( a ) the pathways of man-made chemicals , in particular toxic chemicals , in ecosystems , agro-ecosystems and the global biosphere and the possible undesirable biological effects in humans and animals subsisting often far away from the source point ; and ( b ) interdisciplinary research on re-emerging tropical and subtropical diseases conditioned by particular environments and vectors .  1 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , vol .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
Measures should be taken to prevent the introduction and use of unrelated , irrelevant and inappropriate issues by more powerful countries as a means of gaining advantage in global trade and investment , or as unfair leverage in imposing inappropriate conditions and policies on dependent countries .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
To address the issue of the lack of the critical long-term data necessary to understand global environmental problems , international organizations and the scientific community have designed observing systems to make data collection more coherent and cost-effective .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
Australia 's own decision to suspend the use of anti _ personnel landmines and to support the negotiation of a global ban as soon as possible was not taken without considerable soul _ searching given that the defence challenge for Australia is to be able to protect a vast continent with a small professional armed force .  
Against this background , allow me to defend the global approach which offers us the advantage of being more rational because it avoids piecemeal perceptions , wiser because it allows for the establishment of the balances necessary in any negotiations , and finally fairer because it does not marginalize anyone ; quite the contrary , it rejects measures that are not lasting and calculations that are narrow and brings all those involved together in the same creative synergy . 
We need to pursue these relevant Utopias and I believe the programme proposed by the 28 countries should be considered in the light of the present international context , but also within the expanding horizon of an international disarmament agenda which is intended to have a decisive impact on the status quo and advance even further the swing of the pendulum in the global security system . 
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
Aspects of organized crime , violence against women and violence in the society , in particular as evident in the alarming increase in xenophobic and racist behaviour in some countries , were all topics that could benefit from information exchange and concerted global efforts and at the same time would address some of the pressing issues facing UNHCR as the refugee protection agency . 
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
The rapid development and enthusiasm for the clearing-house mechanism illustrates the widely recognized need for reliable and accurate information to ensure effective implementation of the CBD . The exercise has also demonstrated the complexity of establishing an effective and accessible global clearing-house mechanism .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
It is paradoxical that UNEP , an organization that has over the last 20 years played a major role in the development of systems designed to monitor the global environment , has no discernible internal system for monitoring the substantive progress of and results produced by its projects or programmes .  
JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .  
To this end , the resident representatives worked in partnership throughout 1996 with all relevant headquarters units , particularly with ( a ) the regional bureaux , which provided the supporting management framework , advice , training and , together with the Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) , assistance in matching core competencies with country office needs and ( b ) the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support ( BPPS ) , which supplied analytical tools , developed in consultation with country offices , global studies and methodological guidance .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
There is little question that their social and economic potential is enormous , but so too are the risks that those without the capabilities to design , produce and use the new products and service applications may be disadvantaged or excluded from participating actively in their local communities and in the global information society .  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .  
As shown in the upper right-hand box of figure 3 , if the rules of the game , including intellectual property rights , standards and tariffs for access to global networks , are put in place for the GII on a highly cooperative basis , and if competitive forces are strong , then a balanced environment of competition and cooperation among ICT companies will emerge .  
The work of UNIFEM consists of bringing the reality of women 's lives at the local level " upstream " , so that they become a factor in policy-making and economic decisions at the governmental level , in corporate decision-making and within the global consensus forged through United Nations mechanisms .  
In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , given the need for a transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources , the Board recommends a sustained programme of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on renewable energy , where reasonable , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary , from global sources , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) . 
Road transport and other forms of transportation to a lesser extent , impose social costs in the form of accidents ; damage to human health from particulate matter , carbon monoxide , lead , volatile organic compounds and other pollutants ; congestion ; noise nuisance ; community severance , the " barrier effect " ; local air pollution ; transboundary air pollution from nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides ; and global warming from carbon dioxide emissions .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
At the global level , ACC has established a number of inter-agency groups in order to provide integrated support for country-level action on interrelated themes , namely basic social services for all ; enabling environment for economic and social development ; employment and sustainable livelihoods ; women and gender equality ; and sustainable development .  
The national communication includes aggregated emission estimates using global warming potentials ( GWP ) , with CO2 emissions contributing 80 per cent of total emissions expressed as CO2 equivalent , methane ( CH4 ) 12 per cent , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) 7 per cent and indirect GHG nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) ,  
It is against this background that my country participated in the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) conference held in South Africa from 19 to 21 May 1997 , in which African countries agreed to develop inter _ African cooperation in mine clearance and victim assistance , and to encourage member States to become parties to relevant international instruments governing anti _ personnel landmines , in addition to supporting and promoting efforts to achieve a global ban .  
Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Review the salient issues in the regional strategies and action programmes emerging from recent global conferences , international conventions and agreements ; monitor the implementation of Agenda 21 at the regional level ; and articulate the region 's response to relevant global initiatives , ensuring that such initiatives support the development of the region .  
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at UNCED and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
Recognizing also that coordinated follow _ up implies that the major conferences should be viewed as interlinked and contributing to an integrated framework of and a global partnership for development ; in this context , major cross _ cutting themes established in the world conferences need to be identified and built upon ,  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
The international community has learned that the most pressing developmental issues facing today 's world - poverty and social development , population , governance , gender equality , environment - transcend both sectoral and national boundaries , and effective responses must be multidimensional and global .  
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .  The guidelines included several aspects : prior informed consent and consultation with indigenous peoples ;  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
In the coming months , Canada would continue to promote action in favour of sustainable development at various important regional and global meetings , and it was committed to cooperating for the achievement of satisfactory results at the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
With the advent of the twenty-first century , we now face an historic choice as to what kind of a world we should bring to the new century .  The Chinese delegation holds that the international community should work to establish a just and rational new international political and economic order to ensure global and regional security .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
On the understanding that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people are addressed , the Assembly also stresses the need to strengthen coordination with those departments , agencies and bodies responsible for development activities , in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for development .  
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
Newly emerging phenomena , such as the possibility of long-term climate change with the expectation of disastrous effects on a global scale or , better known , periodic seasonal or geographical anomalies such as the El Ni �� Southern Oscillation phenomenon , create further uncertainties and new challenges for institutionalized warning practices .  
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
The preparation of a high-resolution digital mosaic of the ice sheet and exposed portions of the continent will help to better understand why changes in the ice sheet occur , providing more insight into the effects of human activity and global warming on the rapid retreat of large portions of the shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .  
It was emphasized that the original raison d \ x { 76bb } re of trade preferences in providing developing countries with preferred market access to their major markets is even more relevant in the present world of heightened global competition juxtaposed with continuing supply-side difficulties in developing countries .  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
At the international level there is a public information strategy the aim of which might be described as consciousness-raising , including straightforward dissemination of information on the humanitarian consequences of landmine use as well as advocacy designed to assist the process of imposing a global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
In order to provide a pragmatic focus for the broad and ideal goals of the Plan of Action during the second decade of its implementation , a practical strategy on ageing was developed in 1992.3 The strategy consists of eight global targets on ageing for the year 2001 and 38 suggested national targets on ageing . 
Taking note also of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-first annual meeting , [ 3 ] held in New York on 26 September 1997 , in which the Ministers emphasized the increasing importance and complementarity of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries as a means of supporting and broadening the global partnership in international development cooperation ,  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
Though the end of the cold war has greatly reduced the threat of another global war , which twice in this century brought untold sorrow to mankind , intra-country conflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in several countries , with resultant loss of lives , destruction of national infrastructure , displacement of innocent persons and outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
Such rampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the currency and equity markets of developing countries , at a time when they are still feeling their way in a world of fierce global competition , would trigger off a defensive reflex on the part of the affected countries , thereby arousing anti-liberalization , which would be detrimental to free trade .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
In this era of accelerating change in so many areas in every portion of our diverse global community , it is of singular importance to the well-being of each of our individual national communities , as it is for the overall international global community , that we recognize , observe and be faithful to those values and principles which , inherently , are unchanging .  
Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
This will enable the Organization to meet the daunting challenges of economic development faced by our global community and those posed by the political and ideological differences afflicting nations today .  
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .  
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
The issues he articulated the imperative of development cooperation based on common concerns ; shared values ; solidarity and responsibility to each other ; the need for more resolute action at the international level to address the problem of widening global inequalities and marginalization are issues that require broad debate . 
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
Also , as the Secretary-General has noted elsewhere , the transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting the fulfilment of even national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
We warmly commend the timely initiative taken by Canada in convening earlier this month an international meeting of countries that have committed themselves and taken national action to advance a global ban on anti-personnel landmines .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
Given that existing global stocks of nuclear arsenals number over 30,000 , with the equivalent explosive force of 200,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs , it is imperative that the international community press on , with unremitting vigour , with the global campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
The fact that some of these States have taken these courageous decisions , notwithstanding that they perceive considerable security threats in their respective regions , highlights their commendable long-range vision that only through personal example and truly global action will the Convention be able to achieve its ultimate goal of complete universality .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
In discussing its terms of reference , Committee members attached particular importance to ( a ) assessing world development trends and prospects ; ( b ) identifying national and international policies that would enhance the ability of developing countries and economies in transition to participate effectively in a globalizing world economy and achieve the goals agreed at United Nations global conferences ; and ( c ) undertaking periodic reviews of the list of least developed countries and the criteria used for identifying them .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
They should have institutional arrangements that are flexible , democratic , transparent and responsive to changing global and regional conditions .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .  
That global programme set up through United Nations inter-agency cooperation and underpinned by strong support at the national level in many countries , facilitated the establishment of a network of representative basins , improving understanding of hydrology and water resource management .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
Modelled , to the extent feasible , after the global guidelines for national plans of action , national or provincial guidelines for local plans should be particularly attentive to , and inclusive of , the strategic objectives of partnership , enablement , participation , capacity-building and networking .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels . 
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
This analysis is considered a starting point and focuses on two main elements : ( a ) global interception rates at a time of expansion of international trade and transportation and improved illicit drug trafficking methods ; and ( b ) law enforcement approaches applied in order to improve interception rates and their range of application in selected key trafficking regions .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
It requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of the phenomena and to include in her next report information on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit traffic , as well as information on persons killed , maimed or injured in developing countries through this heinous act .  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
In paragraphs 5 to 8 of the resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit plans for sharing the costs of establishing and operating a global networking facility with United Nations specialized agencies and programmes ; to report on requirements for network services ; to propose formulas for cost sharing ; to provide comprehensive information concerning location of telecommunications facilities in Member States ; and to show clearly the costs of telecommunications attributable to peacekeeping operations .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
Close to 40 formal case-studies were commissioned and three very successful international workshops were held , with financial support mobilized from a wide variety of sources : a regional workshop for Africa ( Dakar , June 1995 ) ; an international workshop for Asia and other regions ( Madras , February 1996 ) ; and a global meeting during the Habitat II .  
The recent adoption of the amended Protocol II to the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention is considered by many as an incomplete measure , lacking an important degree of efficiency , inadequate in coping with the global scourge of anti _ personnel landmines towards the eventual elimination of these horrendous weapons .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Regarding data processing and archiving , the Subcommittee noted that to fully exploit the potential of already acquired and future research data , more international cooperation was needed for their proper archiving , to ensure global free access to databases , to develop mechanisms for improving access to meta-data , and to agree on formats and software packages for data conversion that were necessary for scientific research .  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
The holistic approach to human rights requires , however , that particular attention be paid to the areas of human rights which are currently in a weaker position : from a global perspective , economic , social and cultural rights require further attention in determining their contents and strengthening the means and methods of their realization . 
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .  
Complementary efforts for the provision of technical support by a variety of national , regional and international organizations should be encouraged and coordinated in strengthening global spatial data infrastructure activities .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Global Knowledge 97 will address a fundamental challenge facing developing countries and the international development community in the information age : given the vital role of knowledge in economic and social development , how can developing countries , and in particular the worlds poor , harness knowledge for development , participate in the global information economy and gain access to new tools for life-long learning ?  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
This is also necessary for an optimal combination with emerging satellite systems , which are complementary to terrestrial systems and fundamental for the rapid global expansion of services .  
Some of the specific ongoing research projects include : predictive study on trends in the life-supporting environment in China over the next 20 to 50 years ; dynamic processes and prediction of trends in environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions of China ; research on global environmental change in Antarctica ; the field experiment in the Heihe river basin on the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface ; experiments on ocean circulation in the tropical western Pacific ; and studies on the formation , evolution and environmental changes of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau .  
Databases on contraceptive use ; fertility levels and trends ; mortality ; international migration ; world population ; demographic indicators ; sex and age in five year groups ; populations ; sex and age in single years ; age patterns of fertility ; urban and rural areas ; urban agglomerations ; global review and inventory of population policies ; and population , resources , environment and development ; ( iv ) Information materials and services .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
These conflicting perceptions and the underlying policy dilemmas could be reconciled better in the context of a more comprehensive and global policy dialogue designed to promote coherent policies in all countries for more balanced growth and development and to reduce unemployment in developed and developing countries . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
With an aim of preparing the ground for the emergence of an Afghanistan finding its rightful position with high credibility among the countries in the region and in the world , enjoying friendly relations on the basis of mutual respect and fruitful cooperation with the international family of nations , in particular its neighbours , and standing committed to joining the global struggle against terrorism and drug trafficking ,  
The immediate objectives of the Programme are : to enhance national capacities and strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for providing more and better jobs for women in the participating countries ; and to sharpen global concern for womens employment issues and promote a comprehensive and integrated approach to improving the quantity and quality of employment for women , based on the systematic accumulation and dissemination of information and experiences between countries and regions .  
Although the distributional impact of harmonized national carbon taxes may be uneven , it could be complemented by allocating the revenue to a trust fund to be used to finance projects for those countries which are overburdened with carbon taxes . 29 The rates should be chosen to meet the carbon emission abatement objective and should be periodically adjusted as more is learned about global warming .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
The global plan of action , which sought to create the many new jobs required , especially in urban areas , specifically linked urban economic development to job creation and addressed the positive relationship between shelter and employment .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
The right to a healthy environment has been violated as a result of human activities which increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , with all the consequent effects on global warming , rising sea levels and climate in general .  
In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
Thailand 's space activities had developed in tandem with global space technology ; his delegation therefore appreciated the role played by COPUOS in strengthening international cooperation and norms for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , and fully supported the draft declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
It also firmly supported the work of the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) as the independent international authority responsible for the objective and balanced evaluation of the efforts of States to establish a global narcotics control policy and genuine international cooperation in that area .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :  
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .  
The global warming potentials used to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol listed in Annex B shall be those accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its third session .  
Its purpose is above all to alert the public and world leaders to the role of the oceans in planetary survival , to the threats facing the oceans and to more peaceful and sustainable use of the oceans , as well as to suggest ways of strengthening the legal and institutional framework for ocean governance at the national , regional and global levels .  
With respect to economic concerns , the Commission is looking at how far contemporary economic theory can be applied to ocean management in the context of sustainable development , at the national , regional and global levels and is assessing the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in improving the way humans treat the oceans .  
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
The programme activities of UNDCP are contained in seven programmes by geographic region plus one global programme : sub-Saharan Africa ; north Africa and the Middle East ; central and eastern Europe ; west and central Asia ; south Asia ; east Asia and the Pacific ; and Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
Research in policy development will enable Member States to respond to the global problem of ATS by means of improving the international drug-control system through the action plan against manufacture , trafficking and abuse of ATS for the special session of the General Assembly , and its operationalization and continuing scientific work to keep abreast of the perpetually changing ATS issue .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
The effects of global warming are of grave concern to small islands like ours , whose coastal areas may become submerged , and whose protective coral reefs are at risk of total destruction .  
When my President addressed this Assembly on the impending dangers of global warming and sea level rise over a decade ago , the extent of the threat posed by climate change was not yet widely known or accepted .  
Unfortunately , an international consensus capable of marshalling the required political and economic resources into a coherent programme for economic development and improved governance at the global level has yet to emerge .  
When the Committee was formed over four decades ago , the major challenge that faced it was how to play a major role in one of the most fundamental global transformations in history a transformation that changed the complexion of the international community .  
Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
This is of the utmost importance in order to send a strong and timely signal to the international community that nuclear non-proliferation and efficient legal commitments thereto have to be seen as a crucial element of global security .  
We shall continue our determined action to promote a national and global order based on justice and equity in which all human rights are preserved , promoted and protected in the true spirit of the Universal Declaration . The President took the Chair . 
Assessments are required continuously , to guide rational and effective decision-making for environmental policy formulation , implementation and evaluation at local , national , regional and global levels .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
The main scientific objectives of the mission were the global study of the physical parameters of the planet Mars ( atmosphere , surface and interior ) so as to trace the complex history of its evolution since it was first formed .  
The development of cost-effective , meaningful and useful methods for the regular assessment , monitoring and review of the environmental performance of industry at the local , national , regional and global levels is urgently required .  
While the Covenant represents the most comprehensive single global legal instrument on economic , social and cultural rights , such rights are contained in many other international , regional or national instruments .  
Action at the global level and action at the regional , national and local levels should be consistent with each other and based on common norms .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
ERT ۲ K ( Turkey ) said that as the twentieth century was coming to an end , it had become evident that the international community was moving towards a new world order dominated by global rather than by national standards and institutions .  
We appeal to all parties at the global , regional and country levels to ensure that adequate financial resources are forthcoming so that the immense potential of volunteer contributions , now and into the next century , are fully realised .  
In adopting its agreed conclusions on the subject in 1995 , the Council took a major step forward by providing a coherent set of guidelines for developing a coordinated response to this global agenda at the intergovernmental as well as the inter-agency level .  
The Commission expressed its concern about the growth of transnational organized crime , which was affecting the political stability and social and cultural values of societies all over the world , threatening national and global security .  
The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring countries facing the Bay of Bengal and the quick notification of imported cases of this strain in developed countries raised global concern about a possible new pandemic of cholera .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
The most dramatic and economically successful application of space technology , the communication satellite , has been the greatest boon to national , regional and global economic and social development .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
In the next century , the planet Earth faces the potential hazard of rapid environmental changes , including global warming , rising mean sea level , deforestation , desertification and land degradation , ozone depletion , acid rain and a reduction in biodiversity .  
A new multimedia central editorial board will be established , with the objective of developing and maintaining a timely and more effective news gathering and delivery capacity , tied as much as possible to the global daily news cycle .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
In today \ x { e5b8 } global marketplace , where the supply is produced in one location to meet a demand elsewhere and in which profits from such illegal transactions can be hidden in numerous jurisdictions , enhanced international cooperation is key .  
In this area as in so many others effective international cooperation must be based on three key elements : the political will of States , a global approach to the problem , and the allocation of adequate resources to deal with its underlying causes .  
We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
Due to their size , most of these Territories are not endowed with natural resources and are subject to regular natural disasters , global warming , desalination of water sources , dependency on few commodities and a high level of emigration .  
ECA has developed extensive collaborative relationships with the various global entities , regional and subregional organizations involved in economic and social development in Africa .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , on a global scale the international community has moved forward slowly and has made only modest progress so far .  
For the medium term , his delegation supported calls for the development of a new international financial system based on increased accountability and global governance arrangements that were in keeping with the needs of the current globalized economy .  
Emission reduction targets for annex I countries should be based not on purely political compromise but on objective technical and scientific criteria relating historical emissions to their measured effect in terms of global warming .  
Concerned that global warming may be contributing to the worsening of weather , and concluding that further scientific investigation of the impacts of climate change and its relationship to extremes of weather is critical ,  
In coping with this multifaceted problem , my delegation considers that the United Nations should play a key role in coordinating various efforts at the national , regional , global and non-governmental levels in a timely and effective way .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
He expressed the Communitys concern at the growth of transnational organized crime whose many facets and increasing sophistication threatened not only national and global security but also political stability and social and cultural values the world over .  
The Rio Group noted with satisfaction that the approach to international cooperation had been balanced , realistic , innovative and global , and that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws and recourse to sanctions against States had been rejected .  
The Forum recognized the utility of designing a comprehensive Directory of forest-related international and regional organizations including information regarding relevant global and regional conventions .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
These were responsible for the greater part of the landed catch of the worlds marine fisheries and were the main contributors to the global annual average of 28-million tons of discarded by-catch .  
But it was also necessary to cast a critical eye on the regulations applied in the global market , which was subject to far less rigorous supervision than that exercised by the national mechanisms of stable , developed economic systems .  
Since the crisis was a systemic problem , innovative measures at the national , regional and global levels were required to address the lack of surveillance , the regulation of short-term capital flows and the volatility of currency markets .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
In supporting those processes , whether at the country level through the resident coordinator system , or at the regional or global levels , UNFPA sought to be constructive in raising issues so that meaningful and sustained progress could be made .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
The Global Programme of Action states at the outset that its implementation will require new approaches by and new forms of collaboration among Governments , organizations and institutions with responsibilities and expertise relevant to marine and coastal areas , at all levels national , regional and global including the promotion of innovative financial mechanisms to generate needed resources .  
The reports of the experts are equally ominous .  A lack of safe drinking water for more than one third of the world 's population , continuing soil degradation , increasing global warming , unchecked urbanization , influxes of refugees , population growth and a failure to protect the fragile mountain ecosystem are some of the threatening signs .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , we stress that there are measurable , anthropogenic impacts on the global climate , that these impacts are on the rise , and that continued unchecked growth in greenhouse gas concentrations will result in dire ecological , social , and economic consequences .  
This first bilateral accord opposing the global sex trade in women committed considerable resources to legal initiatives and programmes of research , education and social services directed to eradicating trafficking and prostitution of women .  
Ghana was convinced that sustainable development held the key to global peace , and therefore appreciated the Departments focus of raising the profile of the African continent in the media .  
They are detrimental to the international efforts in arms control and disarmament and may even trigger a new round of the arms race , and will have a widespread and profound negative impact on the global and regional strategic balances in the next century .  
The International Social Science Council ( ISSC ) has as its aim the promotion of the understanding of human society in its environment by fostering the social sciences throughout the world and their application to major contemporary problems and by enhancing cooperation by means of a global international organization of social scientists and social science organizations , encouraging multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary cooperation among its members . 
In 19961998 its programme goals included Furthering the vision of the founders to advance the status of women , in all of its dimensions , including human rights , health issues and internationalism / multiculturalism ; and promoting a unified purpose and direction to ensure that Zonta International remains an international organization by addressing global concerns and issues with a single voice and a combined effort .  
On the contrary , Japan was of the view that , despite the changes in the world economy , the institutions which had been established at Bretton Woods had played a vital role in containing the current crisis and that , far from scrapping them , the international community should concentrate on improving them so that they could perform the functions which they were expected to perform in the new global economy .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
The Preparatory Conference established the following general objectives : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
Whereas the national or subnational knowledge base on the organized criminal groups and their operations is growing , there is no comprehensive global overview of organized crime , a requisite for effective international action to counteract this global menace .  
In the final phase , a global strategy against trafficking in human beings will be formulated in close consultation with relevant national and international organizations and presented for adoption by the international community , possibly at a high-level forum .

Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
Negotiation of a free _ standing new legal instrument dealing exclusively with a transfer ban , even in a fully compatible way with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention , would raise a number of political and legal problems , such as lack of global vocation , setting a precedent by negotiating a partial ban after a clear majority of States has signed a comprehensive one , proliferation of legal instruments dealing with the same content , just to name a few .  
UNIDO , with its capacity to carry out objective and independent studies of the global , regional , national and sectoral issues that affected industrial development , could provide the developing countries with valuable sources of information and advice in that area .

The social , economic and environmental challenges extended far beyond the capacity of individual countries and required a global effort to protect the earths ecosystem and to promote social development and economic growth in a manner which would also preserve natural resources . 
Turning to the question of trade and development , he said that , while trade liberalization was expected to bring about a considerable increase in global income , it must be recognized that , since the early 1970s , the least developed countries had suffered a cumulative decline of 50 per cent in their terms of trade , while the developing countries as a whole had lost $ 290-billion between 1981 and 1991 , which could be attributed to the decline in commodities prices . 
The debates held during the high-level dialogue of the General Assembly on the theme of the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications had highlighted the concerns raised by globalization and the international consensus being forged on the need for a global response to the global challenges it posed . 
It was also important to find new ways of gauging international economic performance , not only by using formal economic indicators but also by measuring the informal and even the illegal economy in order to have a true measure of the global , or total , economy .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication . 
Following completion of the work of the three inter-agency task forces established by ACC ( on basic social services for all , an enabling environment for economic and social development , and full employment and sustainable livelihoods ) and with input from the Inter-Agency Committee for Women and Gender Equality , an inter-agency workshop held in Turin , Italy in December 1997 established country-level arrangements for follow-up to the global conferences and summits .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .

The negative aspects of the current economic situation must be reduced to a minimum and the enormous potential of the global market must be harnessed .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
The 1997 Task Force reported that substantial problems have arisen as a result , and recommended that information centre staff become a communications services group under the resident coordinator , who would be responsible to the head of the Department for developing a plan for how the United Nations global themes can best be adapted and articulated locally ( see report of the Task Force ) .

That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies .

In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
Progress in domestic economic reforms , though varying from country to country , and the improved international environment , notably less unfavourable commodity prices and more stable global financial markets , have been instrumental in improving the outlook .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
The internationalization of the economy of the United States as well as of that of most countries as a result of improved communications , declining transport costs , trade liberalization , and global financial integration has stimulated a wide range of economic activities and changed the international division of labour in many industries .

Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
In a statement it released on this topic , ACC stressed that poverty eradication a main underlying theme of recent global conferences is a key international commitment and a central objective of the United Nations system .  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
The main features of globalization have been an increasing reliance on a deregulated global market , maximally free trade , uncontrolled flow of investment , and the paramount role of the international financial market , with the IMF and the World Bank moving to the centre stage of world power .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
The primary goals of the Conference were to agree on an approach to development that would protect the environment while ensuring economic development , and to lay the foundation for a global partnership between the developing and the more industrialized countries , based on mutual needs and common interests , to ensure a healthy future for the planet .

In view of the continuing need to protect humanity from the impact of natural disasters and of the fact that various national and international organizations and agencies have collected enormous amounts of data from space platforms and have successfully completed a number of related studies , it would be appropriate to initiate an integrated global effort as regards disaster management using space systems .  
In view of the immense potential of space systems to transform societies through distance education and developmental communications , in particular in the developing world , it would be worthwhile to initiate global efforts to create the required awareness among decision makers as well as to ensure effective and synergetic utilization of various space systems in that regard .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .

Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
It is most unfortunate that as soon as the fear of a global crisis waned , people settled for cosmetic changes and repeated the stale old platitudes about how , in due time , freely fluctuating exchange rates would bring a stability of sorts to the system ; this , notwithstanding the fact that there has been almost three decades of constant volatility since that policy was adopted and a string of crises that have grown ever more intensive and destructive . 
Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
Widespread reliance on information-based technologies has resulted in an unprecedented degree of global connectivity and interdependence , with the result that many aspects of national and international activity , public and private sector alike , theoretically can be put at risk by criminal or terrorist misuse .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
The development of a competitive industry generating productive employment within a healthy environment was the best possible bulwark against poverty and the best means of creating an economically sound global society with minimal risks of economic and social conflict .  
In assisting the PA to develop institutional and managerial capacities essential to sound policy-making , UNCTADs assistance to the Palestinian people also helps to enable Palestine to emerge as a distinct actor in the regional and global economic arenas .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
This search is being guided by the expectation that demographic ageing holds the promise of maturing attitudes and capabilities in social , economic , cultural and spiritual undertakings , and for global peace and development in the next century .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
The recommended doctrine confirms India 's craving to be recognized as a global Power - not by acting as a responsible member of the international community but through nuclear and conventional militarization and aggressive actions .  
The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
Thus based on consensus , arrangements enabling improved coherence , complementarity and coordination in global policy-making can avoid unnecessary divisiveness and conflict while promoting fruitful forms of international economic cooperation .  
The cooperation between the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and OIC , through its subsidiary organs and its specialized and affiliated institutions , was closely continued in the social , humanitarian and technical fields and in their bilateral search for solutions to global problems in the region .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
Given IMOs global regulatory mandate , which encompasses the development of international rules and standards designed to enhance the safety of life at sea and protect the marine environment from pollution caused by ships , the twin fundamentals of sustainable development and poverty alleviation have evolved in recent years as parallel concerns to the Organization .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
UNDP / GEF seed resources will be matched by additional co-financing from the countries of the region and from bilateral and multilateral organizations directed towards the global FOCADES account or to specific thematic accounts .  
Some of them emphasize the increased mobility of factors of production , goods and services across borders and the resultant emergence of a truly global market , others see primarily the results and future potential of an explosive progress in information technology , while still others view globalization primarily from societal and cultural perspectives .  
Thus , if based on consensus , arrangements enabling improved coherence , complementarity and coordination in global policy-making can avoid unnecessary divisiveness and conflict , while promoting fruitful forms of international economic cooperation .  
The asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks arising from globalization warrants a global social contract between developing and developed countries , based on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility and with the active involvement of non-State stakeholders with a view to creating a rule-based international system where all countries could take full advantage of the process and where the stronger countries recognize and respect the constraints of the weaker ones .  
Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
For Latvia to succeed , and for the people of Latvia to have the full opportunity they deserve to live secure , healthy and prosperous lives , Latvia must be integrated into the political , business and intellectual exchange of the global community .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
A critical task was joint determination of critical milestones for conceptual designs , for delivery of content by the concerned substantive specialists , for coordination with the concerned technical services and for systematic feedback on design options from beta testers representative of the specialized constituencies for the global social development programme of the United Nations .  
The Gateway initiative began with a concern to provide an expanded range of information goods to the specialized constituencies of the global social development programme of the United Nations Secretariat in a timely and efficient manner and in fully accessible formats .  
We look forward to starting the preparation for the summit , which should adopt a balanced approach between political and economic issues , reflecting the global nature of European Union-Africa partnership in order to ensure concrete results . 
In this context , we would like to add that if the international community , just recently , was able to act in a concerted and comprehensive manner to resolve an issue which had received so much global attention , we firmly believe that if the same concerted and comprehensive approach were applied to Africa , it would surely resolve many of the major problems facing that continent .  
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
Through these multifaceted but integrated activities , UNCTAD should contribute to ensuring the overall coherence of the global economic system and to making it more conducive to fighting poverty , reducing inequality within and among nations , protecting the right of present and future generations to the preservation of the environment , integrating women on an equal basis , generating employment and integrating the marginalized fully into the global economy .  
Mindful of the potential opportunities and risks inherent in the globalization process , the States members of UNCTAD commit themselves to engage in a true partnership for development designed to promote a dynamic and equitable global economic environment .  
It concluded that , after nearly three decades of substantial change in global economic and social conditions in the cooperative movement and in the relations between it and Governments , there was need to change the tone and emphasis of the Recommendation to reassess the underlying concepts of aid to cooperatives and to include matters not addressed by it .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
e .  Marine environment assessments : global and regional assessments of the state of the marine environment ; global and regional assessments of marine mammals , including identification of endangered and threatened marine mammal species ; and rapid assessment methodology for coral reefs ( international coral reef initiative ) ;  
The United States of America , as a permanent member of the Security Council , had a special responsibility towards the Organization ; it was also the sole beneficiary of the 25-per-cent ceiling on contributions to the regular budget , with the result that its assessment level was considerably lower than its share of global gross national product ( GNP ) .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Thirdly , financial and exchange rate instability were closely related and in fact fueled one another , with the result that an integrated treatment of trade and finance was essential for designing consistent national and global policies .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
The Ministers at Marrakech had also agreed to transmit a message to the WTO Conference in Seattle , demonstrating the G-77s determination to ensure that future multilateral trade initiatives would be focused on achieving a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the global trading system , improving conditions of access for developing country products and services in world markets and correcting imbalances in rights and obligations .  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
His delegation stood behind the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and recognized the many pressing issues that bore upon the small island States progress towards sustainable development , including the public health and economic effects of global warming , the conservation of fish stocks and the strain that increased tourism placed on local infrastructure .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
With this objective in mind , ACC decided to undertake during 1999 a comprehensive assessment of the demands placed on the national and international systems by the new global environment that is emerging at the end of the twentieth century .  
Recalling further that these initiatives called for , inter alia , discussions on these themes on the basis of in-depth reports at the global , regional and national levels by intergovernmental , governmental , diplomatic , academic and civil society3 experts at conferences , seminars and other meetings as well as through the Internet , to be reported on to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fourth session ,  
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Australia and Canada , said that the central message of the Cairo Conference reinforced at the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly was that population issues were development issues and that the Cairo agenda should be considered as part of a global framework for sustained and sustainable development . 
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
Increasing globalization had posed a serious challenge to the attainment of the goal of full employment ; the global employment problem was further compounded by neo-liberal views which suggested that economic liberalization in its purest form was vital for growth and prosperity worldwide and which saw attempts to regulate labour markets and promote core labour standards as essentially distortionary and impeding the efficient functioning of markets . 
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Valuable contributions can be made to CLIVAR , the international research project derived from the study of the year-to-year variability of the tropical oceans and global atmosphere ( Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Project TOGA ) which led to the capacity to predict ENSO , by paying special attention to the measurement and understanding of ENSO characteristics in the eastern Pacific . 
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
In the context of the current global difficulties , it had become increasingly evident that economic , social and cultural rights must no longer be relegated to a secondary rank .  
The wave of economic and corporate restructurings undertaken to respond to an increasingly competitive global market and the widespread dismantling of social security systems have resulted in unemployment , work insecurity and worsening labour conditions giving rise to violations of core economic and social rights set forth in articles 6 to 9 of the Covenant .  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
The WTO-regime ( in the specific sense of a trade regime formulated and implemented under the organizational auspices of the WTO ) must be compared not to some idealized global economic democracy but to the most likely alternative a globalized economy shaped primarily by the bilateral efforts of the United States and other advanced industrial countries .  
Those who are satisfied with their global economic performance under existing rules are steadfastly opposed because they do not want to do anything that would jeopardize what they see as the crucial , and already difficult , basic mission of increasing trade openness .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
It considered the important developments taking place within the global economic system , the accelerated pace of liberalization in the multilateral trading system and the increasing emergence of regional and international economic blocs .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,

Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,

Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable and international financial system , with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
From the data gathered , the Panel calculated both an estimate of the total amount spent in the global emergency humanitarian relief effort for evacuees and an estimate of the total donations made to Jordan in cash or in kind and relevant costs that had been borne by other Governments and / or international organizations .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
As far as verification was concerned , the international community should support the UNDCP initiative on the establishment of an independent , neutral and objective global monitoring system to enable States to measure the extent of illicit cultivation on their territory and to take the appropriate measures .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,

In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
At a time of rapid and tumultuous global change , if UNDP can leverage this precious asset into a more effective role in helping countries to meet their development challenges , it will have a remarkable impact on human development and poverty eradication .  
Those were the key elements of an informed approach to global population and development priorities for the twenty-first century and should be addressed in the context of an enabling economic , social and cultural environment at the national and international levels .  
The orbital network of spacecraft operated by Russia was carrying out assignments in a range of basic areas , including implementation of international agreements , organization of manned orbital flights and operation of new industrial technology in space , conduct of basic scientific research , creation of global communications and television broadcasting throughout the territory of Russia , and also environmental monitoring and disaster management .  
Along with an explanation of the global framework and its regional organizational arrangement , the report will include concise methodological notes on how each regional comparison was aggregated and how the comparisons were brought together within a consistent and readily comparable framework .  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
By compiling and analysing the norms reflected in international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , a global framework of fundamental standards could be elaborated , protecting the individual at all times and in all circumstances .  
The variety and importance of the questions discussed at this session ending today and the earnest and constructive spirit in which they were considered show that , because of its representativeness , its universality , its capacity to listen and to see things from all angles , the United Nations continues to be the sole and central forum for pursuing global dialogue on the fundamental world problems facing mankind .  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
They include activities such as environmental planning , use of the geographical information system ( GIS ) , the global positioning system ( GPS ) and satellite images in environmental assessment and monitoring , demarcation of protected areas , guided firewood harvesting , promotion of energy-efficient cooking devices and practices , erosion control , tree planting , agroforestry , and environmental education and awareness raising .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
The proposed resources reflect a net growth of $ 701 , 400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
Thus we need to set aside the residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc security umbrellas with a new and innovative concept of global security networking , an inclusive and participatory system which uses the existing mechanisms in a complementary rather than competing scheme .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
We must give special attention to following up the results achieved at Geneva next June , with a particular eye to translating the agreements from the global perspective of the General Assembly to their regional and national dimensions , with a view to consolidating a political culture in favour of social progress , to use the phrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked the beginning of the social Summit .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
A strong and efficient United Nations will allow us to attain the main objective of this initiative : to determine agreed parameters for creating a stable and prosperous world without violence and without war , on the basis of the principles of inter-State relations contained in the Charter , and to find collective responses to the most complicated global challenges .  
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
There is a shared understanding that future global stability depends on the ability of the international community to increase the momentum for economic development and the capacity of national Governments to improve the delivery of essential social services , such as health and education , and to create employment opportunities .  
Norway fully supports the cooperation between the OIC and the United Nations in their common search for solutions to global problems related to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic , social and technical development .  
Paragraph 3 requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Slovakia recognizes as legitimate the efforts to secure an adequate position in an enlarged Security Council made by certain countries which are capable of assuming global responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
As one of the delegations that first introduced the issue at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in 1979 , we are firmly committed to the goal of achieving a Council that is more democratic , transparent , effective , accountable and relevant to current global realities.Six years have elapsed since the inception of the Open-ended Working Group , and we now stand at the threshold of a new millennium .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
The formation of a global information space , which is transforming information into a precious strategic resource , unquestionably opens up broad horizons for increasing the creative potential of mankind and presents favourable circumstances and conditions for the harmonious development of world civilization .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Taking place on the threshold of a new millennium , the Congress will serve as an unprecedented global forum to exchange and enhance innovative ideas from various relevant disciplines , demonstrate practical solutions and formulate common strategies to fight emerging crime issues , especially transnational crime .  
Over the last quarter-century , through an exhaustive and inclusive process of dialogue and discussion and through programmes of action and international cooperation , population has become part of the global dialogue on economic and social development.It has become part of every countrys political thinking and planning .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
We set ourselves both quantitative and qualitative goals and accepted that their achievement would not only require the commitment and actions of individual nations , but would also pivot on a new global partnership among all the world ' s countries and peoples , based on a sense of shared but differentiated responsibility for each other and for our planetary home .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
The Commission urges relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
To be sure , global conventional energy resources are adequate to meet the projected growth in energy services for decades to come , provided that technology is developed to exploit and utilize these resources in an efficient manner ; the total energy resource base is expected to be expanded by the development and application of renewable sources .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
It reviewed the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of key interventions for adolescent health , highlighted the essential factors and strategies needed to establish , implement and sustain programmes for adolescent health , developed a common framework for country programming and recommended priority actions to accelerate and strengthen programming for adolescent health , including the global and regional support needed for country-level programming . 
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
BICEs representative at Vienna is a founding Board member and current Chairman of the Vienna NGO Committee on the Family established in 1985 , which aims to be an open platform of concerned NGOs for a positive , proactive and global promotion of the family as the basic unit of society .  
Modelling is most advanced in the field of global warming and climate change , and those models are gradually being developed and linked to other models to take account of demographic trends , land use changes , economic development projections and freshwater supplies , as well as atmospheric and oceanic factors .  
If current trends in energy and fossil fuel consumption continue , by 2010 global energy consumption and CO2 emissions will have risen by almost 50 per cent above 1993 levels . 11 There is general agreement that further increases in energy and material efficiency in production processes will need to be combined with shifts in consumption patterns towards goods and services that are inherently less energy and resource intensive if greenhouse gas emissions are to be stabilized . 
Nigeria accounts for 25 per cent of the global spread of AIDS in 1998 , with over half a-million new infections ; yet , efforts to educate the public about AIDS prevention and management are insufficient . 8 The health needs of special or particular groups such as pregnant women , the aged and the disabled , are also neglected . 
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
Recognizing that the current crisis has exposed weaknesses in the international financial system and the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms to create a strengthened international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of global financial integration ,  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
In this context , our country has firmly resolved to work with the whole of the international community and to contribute to the continuing improvement of the global and coordinated strategy defined by the Ottawa process for the complete elimination of the scourge of anti _ personnel mines .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Pending the outcome of the Statistical Commission at its thirtieth session in March 1999 , the Bank is continuing to move ahead to complete the final stages of the current phase of ICP at the global level and initiating activities for the next round .  
It includes purchase of one digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal , one Optaphone digitally controlled rural telephone link system , four global positioning systems and the replacement of 30 base mobile transceivers .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
Scientific and technological breakthroughs , growing interdependence , impressive development of standards of behaviour at the international level , and the emergence of a global consensus to prevent war and curb the perils of armaments and , particularly , weapons of mass destruction are indeed significant achievements of the twentieth century .  
However , in spite of these historic accomplishments , the twentieth century will also be remembered for vivid images of unspeakable horror and bloodshed resulting from our failure to forge an inclusive global security system , in a world in which man , enabled by science , is capable of his own total destruction .  
With the uncertainties associated with the transitional nature of the global order , a tremendous obsession is evident to preserve military supremacy or assume a more prominent global role in the future order through acquisition of more advanced weapons of greater range , accuracy and lethality , something that might quite unravel the progress towards disarmament achieved earlier in this decade .  
General Assembly resolution 50-225 stated that the rapid pace and interdependence of global developments and their implications for all countries had led to a need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management .  
This objective will be pursued through coordination and outreach programmes for encouraging networking and coalition-building among non-governmental organizations , ensuring their substantive contribution to the Council and its subsidiary bodies and in the follow-up to global conferences to secure expert information and advice from non-governmental organizations and to provide training and capacity-building as required .  
An estimated amount of $ 152 , 000 , at the maintenance level , would be required for official travel of the staff of the Division to participate in global , regional , subregional and national conferences , meetings , seminars and symposia that call for coordination and the Divisions input for statistical development ; to assist Member States in institutional development in statistics ; and to ensure collaboration and liaison with the regional commissions on matters relating to statistical development .  
an improved dialogue on global economic and social policy issues in the Assembly and the Council , the identification of policy measures that should be adopted at the national and international levels to address such challenges and enhanced cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and other financial institutions ;  
Consultations and coordination with UNCTAD , the regional commissions , IMF and the World Bank ; provision of improved global on-line access to the Project Link model for other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  
On behalf of the United Nations , the Centre will lead its partners in a global campaign for secure tenure as one of the fundamental requirements for a process designed to lead to the progressive social integration of the urban poor and the realization of their right to housing .  
The senior officer is expected to prepare substantive documents for the preparatory process of the special session and coordinate the preparation of other related inputs and activities , such as organization of global and regional meetings . 
Secondly , as evidenced in the report above , TCDC - both as a modality and as an integral component of contemporary international development cooperation - is increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international community , as offering viable opportunities for improving socio-economic development of developing countries and for enabling their participation and integration in the global economy .  
During its first session , the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development recognized the crucial role played by small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in stimulating broad-based , equitable and sustainable development , as well as the role of the changing global economic environment and the pressures this puts on SMEs .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
To ensure that all users of space consider the possible consequences of their activities , whether ongoing or planned , before further irreversible actions take place affecting future utilization of near-Earth space or outer space , especially in areas such as astronomy , Earth observation and remote sensing , as well as global positioning and navigation systems , which have already become areas of concern because of the pollution of the electromagnetic spectrum ; Action should be taken :  
To welcome take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to implement consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
UNISPACE III had been the first global conference of the United Nations in which industry and civil society had participated as full partners of governments , reflecting the increasing economic use of outer space and the rapidly growing importance of private companies in that area as well as the heightened interest of citizens in matters relating to outer space .  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .  
It is important to recognize that the four principal functions and their supporting functions are fundamental to any future international arrangement and mechanism recommended by the Forum aimed at guiding forest policy actions at the national , regional and global levels .  
The dominant principal function under options 8 to 10 would be the formulation and application of a legally binding instrument on all types of forests , either attached to an existing instrument or as new instruments designed for specific negotiation and implementation at the regional or global levels .  
Formal technical presentations during the first of the three sessions focused on the role of remote sensing in achieving national food security , mapping from space , agricultural applications of small satellites , as well as recent trends in remote sensing and meteorological and global navigation satellite systems .  
Many global and regional financial institutions and national development funding agencies have established guidelines or other requirements governing procurement with funds provided by them , which is typically reflected in their standard loan agreements ( see also chap .  
The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
Moreover , the financial crises appeared to be increasingly frequent and more severe and it was beginning to be understood that they were the result of the malfunctioning of international capital markets and that global action was needed to overcome them . 
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
In particular , the strong State would have to be reinvented applying the decentralized model of organization of the modern global corporation , with the local states taking a proactive role in wealth creation across the territory and the national State acting as strategic leader , consensus-builder and broker between the supranational and subnational levels .  
The current meeting would be another milestone in the quest for sustainable development , which represented a basic precondition for peace and collective human security for global economic order .  
The mission of UNU , a nontraditional international educational institution , is to carry out scholarly work of the highest quality to help resolve pressing global problems of human survival , development and welfare .  
Environmental issues particularly the management of transboundary water resources , environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane to the political one , and have acquired truly global significance .  
The global market environment poses enormous challenges , and there is an urgent need for supportive international policies that will ensure the financial systems efficient functioning .  
Unless the developing nations are able to have a fair share in rising levels of global prosperity , the advocacy of democratic values and human and social standards will remain hollow .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
Each session of the General Assembly provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a unified approach and to coordinate our actions at the global level for the sake of a truly democratic , secure and sustainable development of humanity .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
Indeed , today more than ever , conflictprevention must become a global and integrated strategy to ensure in the long term not only the absence of armed conflict , but that conditions remain conducive to political , economic , social and cultural peace .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
We believe that there is an emerging consensus on the right framework to build a global order based on equal worth and social fairness We are committed to a new international social compact .  
The continuing transfer of capital , technology and managerial and entrepreneurial skills from the rich to the poorer countries has become the classic justification of global multinational activity .  
This global agenda is not restrictive , and can be achieved through the political , cultural , educational , social , economic , information and even technological domains .  
But it was the emerging political will , driven by newspaper headlines and by public opinion , that was the catalyst that gave decisive impetus to the search for a global response to organized crime on a global level .  
The plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful nations to accept rational and realistic changes in the Security Council is a key indicator of the future of global multilateral relations in general and of this Organization in particular .  
Secondly , some of the key elements of the United Nations Charter , which were presumed essential when the United Nations was established , have become totally irrelevant in the vastly changed present global political and economic context .  
There is a growing need to modernize the world by addressing global social and political changes on the basis of generally recognized moral , ethical and legal principles : democracy , human rights , equality , justice , freedom and humanism .  
Let us recommit to accelerate social progress worldwide through a more enabling national environment enhanced by fair , just and equitable relations among the members of our global family .  The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m .  
Participants also recognized the valuable work performed by the Centre in implementing the global programmes against corruption , trafficking in human beings and transnational organized crime at the regional and national levels .  
We are committed to global cooperation to foster international goodwill and understanding and universal friendship and to work in worldwide partnerships developing and promoting a culture of peace .  
As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
The General Assembly is the global institution with the competence to look at ocean affairs in a coordinated manner , integrating all aspects of ocean uses : political , legal , economic , social , environmental and technical .  
Obstacles : Benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed , creating wider economic disparities , unsafe working environments and persistent gender inequality in the informal economy and rural sector .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle through extensive use of synthetic fertilizers , burning of fossil fuels and other activities also has the potential to change the structure and composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
Although there is a wide scientific debate and considerable media speculation about organized crime , there is little empirical research on the extent , structure , nature and strategies adopted by transnational organized criminal groups at the global level .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
The international community must develop highly credible and feasible systems to implement the mechanisms established under the Protocol , particularly the clean development mechanism , so that effective measures against global warming could be taken .

By the same token , the rest of the world can not ignore the unique contribution of small island developing States to global sustainability , through their rich biodiversity , their vast areas of marine resources and their coral reef systems .  
Small island developing States on their own are simply unable to shoulder the vast responsibility that falls upon them the guardianship of the essential global public goods , without increased support from the international community .  
Some have forged ahead and developed integrated , multisectoral approaches to sustainable development which necessitated the establishment of national focal points or coordinating bodies for the implementation of the outcomes of global conferences / summits .

As indicated in last years report , although the major task of studying the global crisis of internal displacement and existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing it is largely complete , there nonetheless remain issues on which additional research and consideration are required .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
Underlying the immediate concern over oil prices were the global macroeconomic imbalances and systemic weaknesses exposed by the Asian crisis , and failure to resolve economic imbalances in an orderly manner would be most damaging to growth in developing countries .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .

Recalling that the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , conferred additional mandates on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and strengthened both its role as the global forum for international cooperation in combating the world drug problem and its functions as the governing body of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and as a treaty organ ,  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of the fourth preparatory committee meeting that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 , and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
The basic orientation of the programme involves three main types of activities : ( a ) the mobilization and coordination of international support ; ( b ) enhanced monitoring and assessment of activities ; and ( c ) advocacy and promotion of global awareness with respect to Africas critical economic and social situation .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was cited , which underscored that human activities are affecting the Earths climate , with potentially significant ecological and economic effects , and that it would be necessary to understand the interrelationships between transportation systems , technology and local and global atmospheric effects as the way forward is being planned . 
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
The major political commitment of States is to take enhanced international action against corruption , through existing instruments , a new binding global legal instrument against corruption and other measures .  
In view of the alarming increase in the illicit manufacture , trafficking and abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS , UNDCP was called upon to give higher priority to supporting Governments to counter the problem posed by those substances at the global level .  
Recalling that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , conferred additional mandates on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , and strengthened both its role as the global forum for international cooperation in combating the world drug problem and its functions as the governing body of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and as treaty organ ,  
She outlined a number of initiatives under way : at global management meetings , human resources issues were always on the agenda ; an Intranet site on staff morale had been established , which encouraged free and open dialogue ; the services of ombudspersons were being used to a greater extent ; and joint workshops for programme and operations staff were being held .  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
The leaders attach special importance to the subject of Arab economic integration and are establishing measures to promote this aspect of joint Arab action so as to achieve a link between shared interests and mutual benefits , as well as strengthen the economic capabilities of their States by adopting an Arab plan that will enable the achievement of full sustainable development and increase joint economic action through positive interaction with the realities of the global economy and the phenomenon of globalization .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional and sectoral levels .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Food Summit and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,

How to continue to benefit from the technical and logistical advantages of ad hoc groupings and limited representation forums , while ensuring that decisions with global repercussions are taken in forums that are more inclusive and that have clearly defined and broad-based intergovernmental mandates , such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the Development Committee and the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council ?  What would be the most appropriate form for an enhanced institutional relationship between WTO and the United Nations ?  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
Weaknesses in some national laws , regulations , licensing procedures and enforcement mechanisms are exacerbated by lack of capacity , insufficient political will , inconsistent approaches and inadequate coordination and cooperation at the national , bilateral , regional and global levels .

The CCA document comprises : ( a ) an initial part , made up of diagnosis and analysis : the assessment as such ; ( b ) a second part which identifies the key issues , strategic themes and entry points of a global intervention framework to be defined at a later stage ; and ( c ) a third , methodological part geared to strategic and systemic discussion of the work of the expanded groups . 
At the international level , determining change over time and producing comparable regional and global assessments require extensive data assessment and analysis , drawing on detailed data source documentation and expert knowledge .  
As a global approach covering , in a coherent manner , the specific requirements of national , regional and international markets regarding quality standards , does not exist , companies are inclined to adopt the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 series of standards .  
The collective capacities of the system need to be harnessed to enrich and expand the knowledge base required nationally as well as internationally to broaden perspectives , act to address potential conflicts such as between trade rules and global , social and environmental goals , and maximize mutual reinforcement among policies and actions in different sectors in support of poverty eradication and development .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
They considered that the closest inter-agency collaboration in integrating ICT into the United Nations systems operations and in helping developing countries bridge the digital divide was essential for the system to remain effective and relevant in a rapidly changing global environment .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
At the regional level , ECA and ESCAP , in collaboration with the UNAIDS secretariat , have held special events in support of the global initiative and in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly , with ECA having organized an African Development Forum at the highest political level focusing on Africas needs to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .

Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
Underscores the need to ensure an effective role of the Special Unit for TCDC as the substantive secretariat of the High-level Committee and as the United Nations system coordinator for TCDC as well as the focal point in the United Nations system for South-South cooperation and to this effect , requests the Administrator of UNDP to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit within UNDP is maintained , and decides to periodically review the impact and functioning of the Special Unit in supporting , promoting and coordinating TCDC cooperation on a global and system-wide basis ;  
Using available estimates , a minimum of $ 500-700-million of global funding , on which countries can draw swiftly in order to fill their budgetary gaps , must be generated , and an additional $ 500-800-million will be required to ensure continued accessibility by countries to essential interventions such as safe and efficacious combination drugs ( once current first-line treatments have outlived their usefulness ) or long-lasting insecticide-treated nets .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional , subregional and sectoral levels .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
The first-ever Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments , which was held at Headquarters from 30 August to 1 September 2000 , concluded with the adoption of the Declaration entitled The Parliamentary vision for international cooperation at the dawn of the third millennium , in which the Presiding Officers pledged their commitment to international cooperation with a strong United Nations at its core , and reaffirmed their belief that the United Nations should remain the cornerstone of effective global cooperation .  
Deeply concerned that the global HIV / AIDS epidemic , through its devastating scale and impact , constitutes a global emergency and one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity , as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights , which undermines social and economic development throughout the world and affects all levels of society national , community , family and individual ;  
In similar fashion , better efforts should be made to achieve improved relations between States , not only because this is mandated in the Charter , but also because it is viewed as essential to the global realization of human rights as indicated in article 28 of the Universal Declaration : quite clearly an international order that is generating terrorist acts hardly qualifies as a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in th [ e ] Declaration can be fully realized . 
The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
The special session of the General Assembly on children was expected to produce a global agenda with a set of goals and a plan of action devoted to ensuring three essential outcomes : the best start in life for all children , good-quality basic education for all children and opportunities for all children , especially adolescents ( who fall into the age cohort of youth ) , for meaningful participation in their communities .  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recognize that international and national exchange and dialogue [ among youth ] / [ at all levels , in particular educational institutions , religious authorities and youth associations ] , and the development of a global network among youth are important and fundamental elements in building intercultural understanding and respect and will contribute to the elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
Further , the Director-General was authorized to proceed with consultations on the establishment of a commission of eminent personalities with outstanding knowledge and experience of the social dimensions of globalization which will be charged with drawing up a major , authoritative report that makes a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the social dimensions of globalization , particularly the interaction between the global economy and the world of work .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
In the current stage of global development , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution for each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
The problems in Africa have only worsened , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and in mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and members of criminal organizations who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
Faced with the increasingly opaque web of local and global politics , economic interests and criminal activity that characterizes many of todays conflicts , we must make the best use of organizations limited resources by engaging all relevant actors in our work to improve the protection of civilians .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Moreover , in the half-century that has elapsed since its establishment on the island of Taiwan , the Republic of China has seen significant political , economic and social development which renders it in practice an important member of the international community , as has been widely recognized at the global level .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
It could be rather useful to make the CST closer to the regional and national levels by organizing , in the period between the Conferences of the Parties , the regional meetings of the CST reflecting , in more complex basis , interlinkages with the activities of relevant subsidiary bodies ( scientific and technology ) of other global conventions and regional agreements .  
Appeals to the international community , United Nations bodies , international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources , including through the new global fund to fight HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit in 2001 and by the Secretary-General , for developing countries , particularly in Africa , with a view to enabling them to fully implement the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the Roll Back Malaria initiative ;  
It had endorsed the two major international human rights covenants , was currently drafting a basic law on the guarantee of human rights and had shared with many countries the benefits of its outstanding achievements in economic development , agriculture , global trade and information and communications technology .  
In its foreign policy , the Democratic Republic of the Congo understands that the use of force can not settle the problems confronting the world today and that in the struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a universal conscience and a universal union that can eliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very survival of the human race .  It is for this reason that my country has signed and ratified several global conventions dealing with the question of international terrorism .  
In designing the global legal framework against terrorism , the complexity and scope of the definition of terrorism should not and must not hinder the international communitys adoption of urgent , practical and effective measures to prevent and punish acts of terrorism and to establish appropriate punishment for their perpetrators .  
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
The commitment expressed by my country to the process of construction of the Euro-Mediterranean space , undertaken six years ago , is based strongly on its deep conviction that only joint and concerted action can consolidate stability and security in this region , and from that , to lay down , within the framework of a global approach , the basis of solidarity and cooperation based on the community of interests and a mutually advantageous partnership .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
Furthermore , the astronomical costs involved in developing a space-based defence system , taken together with those incurred to counter such a move , would inevitably result in heightened strategic competition and greater mutual vulnerability and further deepen the global economic crisis .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
Express our deep conviction that religious , moral and ethical values can play a major role in addressing the global as well as the local environmental challenges facing humanity ;  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
In the current conducive environment , such measures contravene all laws , principles and norms governing international relations in the field of global trade and directed towards the enhancement of extensive commercial and economic interactions among countries .  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
In view of the failure of the global community to harness the benefits of globalization , as evidenced by increasing poverty and marginalization , it was legitimate to ask whether the best interests of the global community were served in a world of short-term profit-taking subject to acute cyclical reverses , where the biggest segment of the market remained undeveloped .  
For the global fight against poverty to be sustained following those attacks , it was crucial to : boost and better target foreign aid ; complement strong reform efforts ; reduce trade barriers ; ensure that the WTO Ministerial Conference was motivated by the desire to use trade as a tool for poverty reduction and development ; and build social consensus for ongoing reforms . 
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
It had been encouraging to see the positive response of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society to forging a partnership with the United Nations system in order to advance the global efforts to bridge the digital divide .  69 .  His own Government had adopted a comprehensive approach to the promotion of science and technology .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
The Centre will advocate , promote , monitor and assess the progress made by combining best practices and enabling policies , and compiling legislation and plans of action for the identification of illustrative cities for the two global campaigns and further advancing the normative debate and operational action on major human settlements issues .  
The theme of the dialogue , entitled Responding to globalization : facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century , was considered to be particularly important and timely in the context of the current global economic slowdown , and emphasized the urgent need for poverty eradication strategies .  
This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
Still , the asymmetry of modern warfare , the existence of shadowy guerrillas with global reach , and the vulnerability of nuclear devices to theft or unauthorized use or simply to the chance that a madman might get his hands on them are today more than ever before eroding the logic and rationale behind the justifications for thousands of weapons designated for mutual assured destruction .  
Official and unofficial assistance to developing countries must be increased , their debt burden must be alleviated and the conditions governing their access to technology for peaceful uses and the access of their products to global markets must be eased to enable those countries to carry out appropriate reforms of their social and development institutions , diversify their sources of national income , create job opportunities for their nationals , provide education , health and social welfare services and combat chronic and epidemic diseases , especially HIV / AIDS .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
The budget proposals before the Committee reflected the best practices of the Organization in operating on a static budget for the past six years through prudent management of available resources , even in the face of increasing mandates and the debilitating effects of global economic conditions .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable development has put increasing focus on the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels .  
If the Agency were unable effectively to track the location and use of nuclear material worldwide , or to give adequate support to national nuclear safety measures , the consequences to the global community could be grave .  
The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .  
Success in the fight against transnational organized crime depended largely on the ability of States to achieve equitable growth , integrate themselves into the global economy in a manner consistent with their economic and social policy objectives and ensure that their populations benefited equitably from new opportunities for empowerment and technological advancement .  
International efforts in response to that threat , particularly those agreed on at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , reflected widespread awareness of the need to take global , integrated action to reduce drug abuse and eliminate illicit trafficking .  
The endeavour to reverse the marginalization of developing countries , to promote their sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to facilitate their integration into the world economy had led the international community to search for integral and balanced global arrangements .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .  
The report also stated that , according to preliminary estimates , the developing world would experience slower growth in its export volumes in 2001 , and that growth forecasts had been revised downwards even prior to the terrorist attacks ; the growth of volume of world trade was expected to drop to 4 per cent from 12 per cent in 2000 , and the global volume of imports and exports would have difficulty withstanding the declines in the prices of primary commodities and of manufactured exports .  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
An unrepresentative and anachronistic Council that does not reflect current global realities would find it extremely difficult , notwithstanding its worthy intentions , to effectively and credibly tackle this momentous challenge to international peace and security .  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
While heightened global concern about terrorism had raised critical issues which were being evaluated and about which decisions were being taken at the highest policy-making levels and official investigations were undertaken , an international coalition was formed with the declared objective of combating terrorism .  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Previous global forum events organized by UNIDO have highlighted the need to address the missing links in the current international development agenda and have emphasized , in broad terms , the complementary measures that need to be taken .  
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
Also encourages in such operations the sharing of geographical data , including remotely sensed images and geographic information system and global positioning system data among Governments , space agencies and relevant international humanitarian organizations , as appropriate , and notes in that context the work being done by the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters and the Global Disaster Information Network ;  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the Strategy , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the Strategy , in line with their respective skills and capacities , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen the coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] prepared in pursuance of its resolution 54 / 98 on the participation of volunteers , White Helmets , in activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief , rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development ;  
The nations of the world should continue to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , vigorously promote the Olympic spirit , seek peaceful solutions to international disputes and regional conflicts , enhance understanding and friendship among civilizations through dialogue and exchange , and work for continuous , global , social and economic development through cooperation .  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation on adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Recognize that gender equality has been fundamental in advancing efforts to achieve sustainable development and that the full participation of women in policy formulation and implementation should be strengthened at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
Recognizing the need to harness synergies and to create cooperation among the various Information and Communication Technologies initiatives , at the regional and global level , currently being undertaken or planned to promote and foster the potential of Information and Communication Technologies for development by other international organizations and civil society ,  
Welcoming the New Partnership for Africas Development , which embodies a common African vision of the future and a shared conviction of the pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place African countries , both individually and collectively , on a path of robust growth and sustainable development , thereby fully integrating Africa into the global economy and political system ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to launch a comprehensive and proactive public information campaign with sufficient financial resources to raise global awareness of the World Summit on Sustainable Development while also building broad international support for the World Summit and its goals ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences , and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
A significant response to this challenge has emerged from various global and regional programmes of environmental research , assessments and capacity-building mainly sponsored by the international organizations that make up the scientific and technological community , including the worlds scientific academies and professional bodies and independent networks of scholars , scientists and engineers .  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
A crucial role in the global governance of sustainable development that has found widespread acceptance since the 1992 Rio Conference has been played by the instrument of authoritative statements based on scientific assessments .  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation in respect of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
This growth in international information-sharing is linked to a large extent to increasing global awareness of the need for continuous monitoring of the environment , natural resources and changes stemming from human activity , as well as emergency management , together with the free use of previously restricted technologies .  
This has been achieved by making the relevant amendments to the Access to space action area by the appropriate means and mechanisms , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by Argentina in that connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
The agreed strategies and actions include developing a joint policy framework , improving data access and pricing , increasing effective research and development , evaluating and reforming education and skills formation strategies , and developing domestic and global markets .  
However , as statistical capacity develops the technical standards that one may apply to any indicator may be increased : definitions may be refined and the quality of the indicator at a global level improved .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment , as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The World Bank hoped that that report would contribute to the global debate at a time when it was imperative for individuals and communities to better manage their human , social , physical and natural resources in the long term and to rethink their basic assumptions about how to use the planets riches and plan economic development .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .  
He had called for a new solidarity based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility , in other words allowing for an adequate apportionment of the burden , bearing in mind the special responsibility of some countries which historically had accounted for a large portion of global resource use to ensure that the developing countries had the means for sustainable development .  
The expansion of global knowledge of and expertise to deal with crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money-laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems ;

The establishment of a new P-4 post for a human settlements officer in the regional office for Asia and the Pacific , in line with recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services to ensure the sustainability of the regional offices and enable them to play a pivotal role in the implementation of the Centres work programme ; there are increasing demands for the regional offices to execute normative tasks in addition to their technical cooperation functions , especially in connection with the Centres global activities in the areas of secure tenure , housing rights and urban governance ;  
Increased application of United Nations global agreements at the national and local levels , including those within the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda that promote sustainable human development in an urbanizing world , capacity-building and institutional development , as well as those included in Agenda 21 and under section 1.7 , Social and economic dimensions , of the Rio Declaration ;

Experts think that this rare and important astronomical phenomenon requires continuous global observation , and that China is located at an important longitudinal position between Japan and Europe , so , China 's observational material from is an indispensable and irreplaceable component in the international joint observation .  
It marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and North and South , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order . 
With regard to this change , Zhang Hongwei , who is here for the Third Session of the Ninth National Commission of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , says the following based on his experience : Confronted with the trend of global economic integration , our country should , from now on , encourage robust domestic businesses to make investments and establish plants abroad and explore international markets so as to gain an edge in the midst of increasingly sharp international competition .  
Since the two countries formed diplomatic ties 36 years ago , friendly relations of cooperation between the two have maintained development on a healthy and stable track through the ups and downs of global situations and their domestic conditions .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
I believe that a healthy , stable , and friendly relationship between China and India is in the common interests of the peoples of the two countries and is also conducive to the global peace and stability .  The Sino-Indian friendship , diligently cultivated by the leaders of the two countries , will certainly continue advancing forward in the new century .  
When many people regarded " globalization " as an inexorable " objective trend , " a German academic soberly analyzed that the " close connection of the global economy is by no means a natural result , but the result of an intentional practice of a policy to chase the set objectives . "  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
He said : China is of the opinion that in order to resolve the issue of nonproliferation , first of all , it is necessary to establish a global security environment of stability , cooperation , and mutual trust .  Building a good international environment in which people adhere to peaceful means to resolve international disputes , and all members of the international community can enjoy universal safety will play a positive role in eliminating the motive of some countries to procure large-scale antipersonnel weapons .  
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
This will be the first summit meeting held between the north and the south since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 .  As a major breakthrough in north-south political relations , the summit meeting is expected to draw global attention .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
The lightning pace of the advance of modern technology is right now influencing the earth on which we live with its mysterious power .  It is creating an unprecedented productive force , but at the same time , it also brings a host of problems like energy crises , environmental pollution , filth from the Internet , and increased polarization on a global scale .  Humanity even has the " nuclear threat " , with which it can destroy itself many times over .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed up the global strategic issues into four characters , " east , west , south , and west " .  He also defined the " north-south issue " , which reflects the gap between rich and poor , as a " core issue " .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
Both the traditional enemies and long-standing allies of the United States heaved a sigh as if relieved of a heavy load , praising the US president for deciding to shelve the NMD program and leave his successor to decide whether or not to deploy the system , which is regarded as a threat to the global arms balance , and saying that the president has made a wise decision which will avoid upsetting the global balance of power .  
The new sports section has two pages , which involves several columns , such as focus of the sports world , global sports events , straight reports on hot-spot issues , stars ' stylish bearing , and quick updates .  This section will offer in a timely manner detailed reports on major sports events and affairs at home and abroad and on things related to sports stars .  
The government has strengthened contacts and consultations with the United States , European Union , and some other major trade partners with an eye on securing a stable external environment for Macao 's export trade .  In the meantime , the government has also actively helped transform traditional industries and has ensured that Macao 's products will keep abreast with global development and remain competitive .  
From an overall perspective , China faces a good domestic and international environment for the development of foreign economic relations and trade next year ; global trade is expected to maintain a certain level of growth , and China 's domestic economy will continue to maintain fairly rapid growth .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
The Gulf War of 1990 became the first testing ground for America 's space weapons .  More than 70 satellites crisscrossed the skies over the Gulf , forming four major aerial systems : surveillance and monitoring , communications logistics , navigation and global positioning , and meteorological logistics .  A vast space network blanketed the skies over the Gulf , giving the Multinational Forces ( MNF ) divine-like guidance .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Qian Qichen said : China and the United States have important common interests and assume a heavy responsibility in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and world peace and stability , preventing proliferation of mass killing weapons and vehicles for carrying them , ensuring regional and global economic stability and prosperity , and coping with international threats .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
Wang Shijie stressed : In the new century , various countries should promote democratization of international relations and establish a new international political and economic order that is fair and just .  They should ensure that the broad masses of developing countries have the right to equally participate in the decisions on global economic affairs .  
The reason is : in a foreseeable period to come , there will be no major change in the international strategic structure , and there will be no major breakthrough in Sino-US relations .  The United States will not make substantive adjustment of its strategy against China . Taiwan 's status as a chessman in the global strategy of the United States will not be shaken , and Taiwan 's role as a counter will not be weakened .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
Over the past 20-odd years , ever since it was established , CITIC has witnessed relatively smooth development as it has benefited from a correct understanding or judgment of the global economic situation , and this is the key reason , and is inseparable from the work of the CITIC Consultation Committee .  
Immediately after the Bush administration announced in March that the United States would not execute the Kyoto Protocol , which is aimed at reducing the global emissions of greenhouse gases , most states and nongovernmental organizations in the world voiced strong discontent over the US move to damage the international community 's major environmental protection effort and demanded one after another that the US Government change its decision .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
Whether they are large or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , all countries should participate in global economic management on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and jointly create and defend a new international economic order that is just and equitable . "  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
After the 1980s , advanced technology has been used in conducting geological investigation and research , such as global satellite positioning , GPS monitoring system , and aeronautical remote sensing technique , which has led to the establishment of the datum net for GPS monitoring in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project , and GPS net for monitoring local deformity .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
Only when the majority of young officers and soldiers have a sense of urgency being aware that time waits for no man , making diligent efforts to become high-quality military professionals and striving to improve their own quality can they keep up with rapid development in the global field of military science and technology and genuinely fulfill their sacred mission of revitalizing the military and serving the motherland .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
In the four months since it took office , the Bush Administration has stirred up trouble everywhere ; from pushing the MD system heedless of the international community 's opposition , to refusing to implement the " Kyoto protocol " aimed at controlling global warming , and on top of that , gesticulating at the establishment of an independent defense force by the EU , the United States has practiced a kind of arrogant and selfish unilateralist policy . 
If the NMD plan were implemented , it would shatter global strategic balance and stability , damage mutual trust and cooperation among the world 's great nations , hinder international efforts to reduce and halt the spread of armaments , and touch off a new arms race .  
What should be even more highly shocking to people is that the Bian administration continues to confront the mainland by pursuing a line of " resisting reunification with weapons , " professing that he wants a " decisive battle outside the boundaries , " ordering a large number of advanced weapons from the United States , and actively coordinating with the United States to revise their global strategy , and acting as a willing pawn of the international anti-China forces working to " contain " China .  
In the past more than 100 days , it not only announced the withdrawal from the " Kyoto Protocol " aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas release , but also decided to break the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed before and deploy the national missile defense system that will break the global strategic stability .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
Shi Guangsheng : The Foreign Trade Minister meeting is an important routine meeting of APEC that is held once every year .  Ministers and officials of every member state hold discussions and seek mutual understanding on major issues impacting global and Asia-Pacific regional economic and trade development .  The meeting serves as preparation for the Joint Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministerial meeting and the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting scheduled to be held at the end of this year .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the important " three represents " ideology advanced by Comrade Jiang Zemin has answered from a political , economic , and cultural point of view the basic questions of what type of party to build and how to build it .  It has given expression to a distinctly advanced characteristic , a scientifically innovative spirit , a broad , global view , and a staunch purpose for party building .  
The meeting of ministers responsible for trade among APEC member economies and the discussions on major issues concerning regional and global economic and trade development are of major significance for the maintenance of a stable and open economic and trade environment in this region and the establishment of a fair and rational new world economic order .  
Not only is a new round of multilateral trade talks a major issue that concerns all countries today , but APEC 's 21 APEC member nations account for about half of world trade and half of the global economy .  Their voice has a decisive role on the international economic stage .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
At the time when the US economy is in recession and the depreciation of Japanese yen and Korean won has reduced the competitive edges of China 's exports , China 's economic officials and scholars maintain that devaluation of renminbi to stimulate exports and the economy is not likely in the foreseeable future , and that further expanding domestic demand and increasing investment and consumption remain to be China 's only correct policy measure for the present to cope with global economic slowdown .  
But recently , some subtle changes have occurred in the bilateral relationship : The US announced it would withdraw from the " Kyoto Protocol " to control greenhouse gas emissions and halt global warming , greatly displeasing Japan ;  
Only in this way can our Party when faced with fierce global struggles , tough challenges and crucial risks and when in battle in over such things as politics , economics , culture and values be permanently successful .  Only in this way can our country better protect its security and interests and develop in accordance with the planned objective .  
Hu Angang believes that , in a situation in which the rapid deceleration of the US economy is leading to a slowdown of the global economy , it is necessary to have an overall grasp and understanding of China 's present economic situation from the angle of historical development and a relative international perspective .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
She said : During the visit , President Jiang Zemin and President Putin will exchange views on a wide-range of current major and pressing regional and international issues , in order to make concerted efforts to safeguard global strategic balance and stability .  
Diplomats of the two countries disclosed that Jiang Zemin and Putin will hold a summit meeting to exchange their views on the current international situation , major global and regional issues , including the US claim to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its readiness to build the national missile defense system .  The two heads of state will reiterate their stands clarified during the " Shanghai Five " summit in June this year , namely , Putin stressed that Russia firmly safeguarded the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to prevent a new round of arms race ;  
As the statistics for various economic sectors are announced , the outline of China 's national economic development in the first half of this year is gradually becoming clear : China 's economic growth has continued to maintain a strong momentum amid the overall environment of weakening global economy .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .  Some people therefore hold that the developed countries and even the pharmaceuticals interest groups there may be the ultimate beneficiaries .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
In order to further improve the global development environment , the developing and the developed countries should continue to promote reforms in the international financial setup , launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations , narrow the development gap between the developing and the developed countries , and work together to build a more fair and rational new international economic order .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .  
This development has rescued the " Kyoto Protocol " which is facing the danger of falling apart , has established operable guidelines for the protection of the global environment on which humans depend on to exist , and is of a great significance to improving the world 's climatic conditions and ecological system .  
As pointed out by a responsible official of the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee , press , publication , radio , television , and film industries should be committed to innovating the macro managerial mechanism , the micro structure , the market organization system , and the investment and financing systems , so that China can occupy an important position in the global media structure .  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
Through this window , people can feel that China , a country with a stable political environment , with an increasingly developed economy , with ethnic unity , with social progress and with increasingly greater overall national strength , stands in the East and is a major credit to maintaining global peace and development .  
The primary force driving Sino-US relations forward is that there are enormous common interests between the two sides on both national and global strategic issues and that these interests far outweigh the differences and contradictions between them .  
In the early days of his office , Bush put on the airs of a supercilious " global overlord " on the diplomatic front and met with extensive opposition from the international community .  It landed the United States in a very isolated state , incurring more and more criticisms and worries from within the United States . As a result , the support rate for Bush in the opinion polls kept falling .  
State Councilor Wu Yi indicated in a written speech : In facing the present new situation wherein China is about to join the WTO , we must take both Deng Xiaoping Theory and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " as the guide , adopt a more active approach in our participation in cooperation and competition on a global scale , and make continued efforts to push forward the practice of opening up in all directions , at multiple levels , and in a wide range of fields .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
" The Chinese People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] is a mighty , civilized , and victorious military force which has been ever-triumphant .  Moreover , after carrying out reform and opening up for over 20 years , China has attained outstanding accomplishments in facilitating economic and social progress which attracted global attention .  Consequently , China has very considerably enhanced its social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and national defense capability .

" The Chinese People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] is a mighty , civilized , and victorious military force which has been ever-triumphant .

Consequently , China has very considerably enhanced its social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and national defense capability .  
US President Clinton recently submitted to Congress the national defense budget for fiscal 2001 ; the total amount of the budget is $ 305.4 billion , an increase of $ 16.5 billion - - 5.7 percent - - over that of fiscal 2000 ; the figure represents over one-third of total global military expenditure and is equivalent to the total expenditure of the eight countries ( regions ) which rank after the United States .  
President Putin of Russia and visiting President Clinton of the United States held talks on such issues as global strategic stability at the Kremlin on 4 June . The joint communiqu on principles of strategic stability signed by the two sides pointed out that the presidents of the two countries would work hard to strengthen strategic stability and international security and declared that in the future there would be further discussions on further reductions in the two countries strategic forces within the START III framework and continued consultations on the antiballistic missile issue .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
In his speech at a special session on social development of the UN General Assembly here on 28 June , Wen Jiabao , head of the Chinese delegation and vice premier of the State Council , pointed out that it is a long-term arduous task to bring about global social development and that unremitting hard work over a long time by the governments and peoples of various countries as well as the international community is needed .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
11 .  The two sides emphasize the importance of exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern .  They are willing to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and work to build a just and rational international political and economic new order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
11 .  Both sides emphasized that exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern is of great significance , and are willing to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation and to make efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the UN Charter as well as established principles of international laws .  
In answering the question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held by the Foreign Ministry today , Sun Yuxi said that China thinks the missile defense plan announced by the United States is not in keeping with the trend of the times , is harmful to the international efforts dedicated to arms control and disarmament , and will produce a harmful impact on global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
He believes : If the plan for star wars is approved , the consequences of global arms race will be very serious : It will undermine existing international agreements on arms and on destruction of nuclear weapons , including international treaties banning nuclear tests , treaties on reducing strategic weapons , and agreements on controlling and stopping nuclear weapons .  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
At today 's news conference held by the Foreign Ministry , Sun Yuxi , while answering a reporter 's question regarding the failure of the US missile interception test , said : The US development of the NMD system will break the global strategic equilibrium and stability , hinder the nuclear disarmament process , spoil the efforts of the international community on non-proliferation , and may trigger off another round of the arms race .  This is against the interests of all nations across the world , including the United States itself .  
The 1972 " Treaty on Restricting the Antiballistic Missile System " ( hereafter called the " ABM Treaty " for short ) still remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security and is the basis of key international agreements on reducing and restricting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao solemnly stated when briefing today on the Sino-Russian joint statement on the ABM issue that China and Russia both oppose the National Missile Defense [ NMD ] system , and appealed to the international community to continue to show serious concern regarding those countries which are vigorously developing ABM defensive systems that undermine global strategic balance and stability , and also take the necessary steps to prevent the development of this dangerous trend .  
He said , in this joint statement the two sides emphasize that the 1972 " Treaty on Limiting ABM Systems " remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security , and is the basis of key international agreements reducing and limiting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
The development of the NMD and the TMD is bound to undermine global strategic balance , lead to a new round of arms race , and produce broad , far-reaching negative impact on international peace and security , on the process of international arms control and disarmament , and on the international non-proliferation efforts .  Such developments are compromising the regional confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the regional security .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : When China and Russia , two friendly close neighbors , enhance cooperative ties , they will exert very strong impacts on global situations .  In the future , both sides should maintain contacts and coordination while handling major issues .  
and added an enchanting brilliance to the prosperity and development of the global economy .  China 's stable political situation , social security , and an economy that has always maintained a relatively high speed of development , are key to China 's achievements in attracting foreign business investments .  
What warrants people 's special attention at present is that as tough measures are unworkable , they are replaced by soft measures such as intervention in the name of humanitarianism , human rights overriding sovereignty , human rights prevailing over everything , and global intervention without boundaries .  
He said : Russia and China 's decision to establish a strategic cooperative partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] has been a historic and correct one in the interest of both countries .  It is conducive to regional and global peace and stability as well as to progress towards a multi-polar world .  
In order to contain the global offensive tendency of the Soviet Union which constituted the most important threat to the United States , in spite of the intense opposition of those pro-Taiwan forces within the US Congress , it established diplomatic relations with China at an ambassadorial level and meanwhile abolished the US-Taiwan " Mutual Defense Treaty " signed in December 1954 . 
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
According to the forecast of the UN Conference on Trade and Development in its annual report on global investment which was published a few days ago , once China enters the WTO and carries out the market economic reform stipulated by the WTO , it will trigger a new round of foreign investment craze in China , with the investment amount increasing from $ 40 billion a year on average at present to $ 60 billion , and even as high as $ 100 billion in future .  
The countries concerned should observe the treaty and other concluded legal documents on arms control and disarmament .  They should not develop or deploy the NMD system , which upsets global strategic balance and stability , nor should they assist other countries in acquiring such a system or interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and undermine their sovereignty and territorial integrity through the proliferation of sophisticated antimissile systems and technologies .  
The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
Once the NMD system is deployed , the results in bilateral and multilateral disarmament and arms control obtained over the past several years will be destroyed in one day .  With the destruction of global strategic stability , unilateralism in international relations will increase .  There will be more unstable factors in both global and regional security .  
As viewed internationally , just as the rapid development of the modern European and American countries brought by the sprouts of the capitalist production relationship and industrial revolution , the trend of world multi-polarization and global economic integration is increasingly prominent at present , the scientific and technological revolution in the world is advancing by leaps and bounds , and the knowledge-based economy has begun to show an inkling .  This has brought new opportunities and challenges to various countries , which , at the same time , are confronted with a new round of fierce economic competition .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
While the international community is facing daily increase in global problems , it is necessary for all countries , including China and France , to make concerted efforts and strengthen cooperation in protecting the environment and combating drug trafficking , illegal immigration and transnational organized crimes .  
He said : While globalization is developing rapidly , the global management system is obviously lagging behind .  There is an urgent need for the international community to formulate coherent and effective management strategies , conduct reforms on current global economic system , so that the system will represent the interests of the great majority .  Accordingly , it will be guaranteed that all countries , especially the developing countries , will be able to enjoy the benefits fairly brought about by globalization , so as to realize the goal of eliminating poverty and achieving sustained development .  
These objectives include : greatly increase the level of overall industrial science and technology and international competitiveness , so as to enable the technological level of China 's principal sectors of agriculture , industry , and the service industry , especially manufacturing technology and equipment , to reach the 1990s level of developed countries and some sectors to enter advanced global ranks ;  
Also , both China and Thailand are developing countries and both are facing the arduous tasks of developing our respective economies and improving our peoples ' living standard .  We hold identical or close viewpoints on many important regional and global issues .  
The broad mass of developing countries face the arduous dual tasks of not only having to exert great efforts to transform their traditional industries but also striving to develop new industries , or it will be hard for them to realize virtuous development of their economies and to deal with harsh challenges brought about by the development of the global economy . 
As a major power in the Arab world and Africa , Wu said , Egypt has played an important role in regional and global affairs .  Egypt has won widespread acclaim for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East region and the world at large , strengthening unity among the Arab and African nations , and promoting and developing common prosperity of the developing nations .  
In his speech at the meeting , Li Peng , chairman of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , pointed out that the convening of this grand meeting in China indicates that China 's tremendous achievements in the building of legal system have attracted worldwide attention , that law education and research in China have an increasingly extensive impact on the global affairs , and that the world is extremely concerned about the building of a socialist country ruled by law in China .  
Li Lanqing expressed deep belief that full advancement of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is not only in keeping with the basic interests of the two countries and their people , but is also beneficial to regional and global peace and stability .  
Economic globalization is the necessity of the development of large-scale socialized production , and is the new height and stage of this development , in which resources and social production factors are allocated in the most effective way on a global scale .  It represents the most advanced production mode and productive force hitherto seen in human society and will become the economic base of world peace , universal harmony , and the future new society of mankind .  
It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .  The waves of impoverished developing countries opposing the developed countries headed by the United States will certainly surge higher and higher , class struggle will move from a country to the entire world , and the era of peace and development will come to an end , which will be replaced by the new round of revolution and war on a global scale .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
Regional conflicts sparked by ethnic , religious , territorial , resource , and other factors have continued to break out ; all kinds of splittist forces , terrorist forces , and extremist forces have continued to compromise the international community ; environmental , drug , refugee , and other global problems have become increasingly prominent .  
First , before and after George W . Bush assumed office , he declared that the United States would promote a diplomatic policy based on a " unipolar world " and stressed the " leading position " of the United States . Meanwhile , he announced that the United States would adjust its global strategy and shift the strategic emphasis from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .  
The new US Administration recently increased defense spending by a big margin and has vigorously pressed ahead its NMD [ national missile defense ] program , drawing strong denouncements from the international community .  However , a small number of countries , such as Japan , have not complained at all about the US act to dominate the world , which will spark a global arms race .  Moreover , Japan has exerted itself in cooperating with the United States in developing a strategic missile defense system .  
" We lack a group of leading talented people who are capable of leading and directing in global science and technology , and we lack a large number of high quality operational and managerial talents who are familiar with market economic law . "  
If we want to occupy a position in the highly competitive field of advanced science and high technology and to put ourselves in a favorable position in global economic development , we must pay great attention to the issue of intellectual property rights , looking at it from a strategic angle , " said Xu Guanhua , CPPCC member and newly appointed minister of science and technology .  
It holds fast to the crux of China 's modernization drive at the beginning of the new century and fully embodies the global views and strategic thinking of the party central committee .  Hence , it is the basic guiding principle which we must understand and take advantage of in the future economic and social development of China .  
Following the Asian financial crisis , the United States saw that China 's image as a major power is developing in a " positive direction " and [ that China ] is a responsible and cooperative big power .  Enjoying economic prosperity and stability and the further elevation of its international standing , China occupies a rising position in the US global strategy .  Even US security and prosperity increasingly depends on the development of Sino-US relations .  
After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .  It is time for the United States , as the designer and protector for the security and economic order of the international community , to discard the diplomatic pattern of self-centered unilateralism and to rely on the coordinating and managing functions of multilateralism .  
" Against our free trade philosophy , the prime objectives of Hong Kong for the international trade forums are two-fold : first , to further the benefits of trade liberalisation with a view to achieving the global free trade and second , to maintain a rule-based multilateral trading system which is relevant and responsive to the needs of the modern business world , " he said .  
We are gathered here today for a common objective - international economic and monetary cooperation to achieve stable global development , prosperity and stability .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
We held an Environmental Awareness Seminar for our senior staff in the City Hall in October 1997 , enlisting assistance from external expert key speakers .  The purpose was to introduce to our staff the total concept of protecting the environment from global , regional , local and management perspectives .  
The challenge ahead is to promote shared growth , to forestall future crises , and to design a new international financial architecture that promotes resilient financial systems , efficient global resource allocation and a level playing field .  
" Today , television , personal computers and mobile phones have formed an integral part of our life .  Such advance in the communication technology has enabled us to keep abreast of the world within doors .  Looking ahead , with the rapid development of global communication and the Internet , it wo n't be long before the era when people can master the jobs within doors will come , " Dr Leung said at the brief handover ceremony .  
" I have maintained close contact with international business and financial leaders in order to have a better grasp of the current global economic climate .  I also explain to them the purpose of our policies , in particular those implemented and being planned for the financial markets . "  
He called for new rules and strategies to cope with the huge inflows and outflows of capital that are part and parcel of today 's global trading and investment environment as well as a new set of international guidelines to facilitate smooth , sustainable growth rather than boom and bust cycles .  
Talks focused on looming global economic problems , disparities between the speed at which financial markets have developed and the regulatory frameworks governing such activities , China 's emergence as a global economic power and its role as a stabilising factor within Asia , and the impact of the Euro on Asian and global financial markets .  
The Financial Secretary , Mr Donald Tsang , says there is a growing consensus among Hong Kong 's major trading partners that there needs to be ' quick and decisive ' efforts to deal with the current global economic and financial crisis .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .  
So , just as last year 's policy address set a visionary and positive tone for our future in the wake of an extremely successful transition , this year 's address was soberly precise in its analysis of the current situation , pragmatic in its approach to tackling our problems , yet forward-looking and responsible in taking some of the concrete steps we need to find a new niche for ourselves in an ever-changing global economy .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
As far as law enforcement is concerned , it is a very complicated global problem to enforce laws regarding the Internet . It is a problem law enforcement agencies throughout the world are very much concerned about , because effective investigation and prosecution of Internet-related crime involves many new concepts and complicated issues on computer technology , such as key escrow and decryption , interception of telecommunication , real-time monitoring , tracking of local and overseas electronic transactions , computer forensic examinations of local and overseas electronic evidence , etc .  
" Under the proposed regulatory framework , Lloyd 's will be subject to requirements applicable to other authorised insurers .  These include the maintenance of solvency margin and local assets , appointment of fit and proper representative in Hong Kong , proper regulation of its insurance agents and separate reporting of global and Hong Kong business .  
There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .  The theory is that , in a liberalised global financial system , international capital flows reward countries with sound economic policies and punish those which pursue unbalanced and inconsistent policies .  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
On the promotion of efficient functioning of global markets , Mr Trichet said that full and reliable transparency for all , including both public and private sector entities , would be the most effective measure for countering dangers arising from the " herd instinct " of market participants .  
Both exchanges ' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as proposed by the Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future development of Hong Kong 's financial services industry and that it will be critical to maintain and strengthen further Hong Kong 's position as a global financial centre in the increasingly competitive international securities and derivatives market .  
Topics covered during the 75-minute ABAC session included lessons from the Asian financial crisis , sustainable economic growth , accelerated trade liberalisation , APEC 's contribution to the WTO , the development of a policy framework to cope with a competitive global economy , the abolition of subsidies on food products within APEC and Y2K readiness .  
The latter is necessary for the efficient and effective future management of the projects , and for a continuous development of their respective area to keep up with the dynamic and competitive global environment , " he added .  
Financial liberalisation became very much the fashion , leading to domestic financial markets rapidly attaining a global dimension , welcoming and absorbing international capital .  
" The Advisers believe that Hong Kong is well placed to capitalise on its position as a global financial centre , given our strengths , quality physical infrastructure , resourcefulness of human capital and unique economic links with the Mainland , " he said . 
In the ensuing decades , based on the system laid down by the United Nations ( UN ) Economic and Social Council 's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , international codes have been developed and published .  These codes have been revised regularly to catch up with the technological developments and requirements of global trade .  
The Commission believes that these World Cities are major centres of global commerce because they have the economic structure , the hard and soft infrastructure , the institutions , the quality of life , the cosmopolitan and outward perspective and the relationship with their hinterlands that enable them to attract international capital , businesses and skilled individuals . 
Speaking on the control of strategic goods in Hong Kong , Mr Tsang stressed that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government , as an active and responsible player in the global economy , was fully committed to operating a law-based , transparent , stringent and internationally accepted system of controls on the trade of strategic commodities .  
" Local professional bodies , regulatory institutions and the government will monitor the development of the markets and take necessary measures to keep our regulatory regime up to date and abreast with the global trend .  Above all , we will strike a proper balance between the protection of the rights of investors and assistance rendered to the emerging enterprises so as to ensure that our financial industries will continue to flourish in the new economy , " she stressed .  
But as markets attained a global dimension , encouraged by financial liberalisation and the advance of information technology , they became far less tolerant of weaknesses than before , and the markets responded to weaknesses with harsh punishments , which many considered grossly unfair . 
This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
In the ensuing decades , based on the system laid down by the United Nations ( UN ) Economic and Social Council 's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , international codes have been developed and published .  These codes have been revised regularly to catch up with the technological developments and requirements of global trade .  
Hong Kong 's bid to host the Asian Games has greatly encouraged our athletes to work with untiring efforts to upgrade their skills and enhance the status of Hong Kong in the international sports arena .  It does not only greatly inspire our athletes and other members of the local sporting community to move forward , but also unites all sectors of our community to work with concerted efforts to achieve our common goal and to demonstrate to the global community our entrepreneurial spirit and vitality .  
Mr Tung said APEC Leaders had resolved to continue working in international forums to help shape the global economy and to provide a more secure and stable financial environment for developed and developing countries .  
In step with the global trend to open up the television market , we consider that the Government 's role should be to create an open and competitive market to promote the development of the broadcasting industry .  The Government should , as far as possible , refrain from intervening in the market , such as imposing mandatory requirements on domestic pay television programme service licensees to provide a channel to broadcast the programmes produced by the RTHK or the cultural presentations organized by the LCSD .  
This seven-year full-time programme , to be offered from 2001-02 , will produce medical graduates with a sound understanding of both Chinese and western medicines to meet the global need for development of an integrative medicine based on modern scientific concepts .  
But to stay ahead in the increasingly competitive global knowledge economy , we must continue to upgrade our education system , improve our living environment , beautify and green our city and speed up urban renewal , so that we not only have quality people , but also quality homes to meet rising expectations as society advances . 
Each year we determine according to economic growth projections , the total amount of money likely to be available for ongoing projects and new projects ready to start in the coming five years .  Within this global figure , we exercise control over the funding of individual projects through the Government 's annual resource allocation system , under which we take account of the planned programme and the projected annual cash flows on each project for the five-year planning window .  
At the annual meeting , member jurisdictions discussed a wide range of issues , including economic implications of money laundering , global anti-money laundering initiatives and the regional response , APG mutual evaluations , and current and future typologies work on money laundering methods .  
" The new arrangement aims to attract Mainland students who had completed their bachelor degree or higher level studies in Hong Kong in 1990 or afterwards to re-enter here for employment .  The ultimate aim is to build up a critical mass of quality personnel so as to enhance the competitiveness of local companies in the knowledge-based global economy with a view to facilitating the economic development of Hong Kong , " she added .  
( The Hang Seng Index fell further to 11 316 on 30 August , affected by lacklustre performance of the major stock markets overseas amidst a dim global economic scene . )  
Mr Leung said : " The global financial system remains under stress , given large external deficit of the US , extended deflation and weak banking system in Japan , significant correction in major equity markets , more volatility and misalignments in exchange rates , and problems in key emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey . "  
Following complex , protracted investigations into two separate global drug trafficking syndicates , the hard work and co-operation established between representatives of each agency involved finally bore fruit with the confiscation of drug trafficking assets totalling over HK $ 83 million from Hong Kong financial institutions .  
I look forward to the positive response and commitment of the community as a whole , in particular , parents and the business sector towards improving the quality of the local workforce so that Hong Kong would become a real knowledge-based economy and Hong Kong 's competitiveness on the global front may be enhanced . "  
We are washed by the same body of water and we are pretty much all in the same boat .  This is some boat .  The 21 member economies of APEC are home to some 2.5 billion people ; represent 44% of global trade ; and in 1999 had a combined gross domestic product of US $ 18 trillion .  
" As stated by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address this year , the Government is fully committed to providing a conducive environment and the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the development and promotion of Hong Kong as the preferred international and regional transportation and logistics hub , as well as a base for coordinating and integrating service providers for the global and regional demand and supply chain , " Mr Leung added .  
Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
We look forward to playing a more active role in contributing to the sustained growth of China , both as a source of investment and as a partner to overseas firms looking to strengthen their presence in a country set to become a key engine of global economic growth . 
The gloomy global economic outlook amidst wary over a protracted US economic slow-down , and the successive waves of US corporate profits warnings , pushed down share prices worldwide .  The local stock market was likewise hit .  
Then the 911 incident aroused widespread anxieties in the global financial markets , causing the Hang Seng Index to plummet to a near three-year low of 8 934 on 21 September , 14% down from the pre-911 closing level .  
Also speaking at the opening ceremony , the Commissioner for Labour , Mrs Tan Kam Mi-wah , said : " The theme of today 's workshop is ' Developing decent and sustainable youth employment ' .  The theme was set in response to the ILO 's global policy of developing decent work for the youth , and is in perfect accord with the concept of lifelong learning prevailing in Hong Kong . "  
On the second point , the answer is that we have not conducted an assessment on the subject raised by the Hon Chan Yuen-han .  The reason is that the commercial decisions of enterprises , including whether and when to move a business or certain production processes elsewhere , are always subject to a wide range of factors .  These would include the prevailing global and domestic economic climate , the market conditions of individual trades , as well as the adequacy of manpower supply and operating costs .  
The conference will review the progress of key tasks under the Regional Strategic Plan and identify the way forward for advancing the region ' work on co-operation and mutual assistance .  There will also be discussion on a number of issues being pursued at the global forum of the WCO , such as anti-cigarette smuggling measures , and efforts to strengthen Customs mutual administrative assistance .  The conference will also discuss stepped up Customs measures to combat international terrorism .  
CNBC , the foremost global provider of business and financial information and TNT , the world 's leading business logistics solutions company , today ( May 23 ) announced the launch of the Asia Business Leader Awards 2002 , the prestigious annual honour that recognises achievement , innovation and leadership in regional business .  
" As the trusted global advisor with a long and rich history in servicing the world 's most influential and successful entrepreneurs , corporate executives , and families , The Citigroup Private Bank is pleased to be identified with the Asian Business Leaders Awards for the second year running .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
Since its inception by the WHO in 1980 , the ICDRA represents a very important and unique global forum at which national drug regulatory authorities from amongst the members states learn of international tendencies , discuss current issues , exchange point of view and draw up recommendations .  It also offers an unparalleled opportunity to promote collaboration between developed and developing countries .  
" HK has maintained its advantage .  It still possesses a lot of competitive edges .  It is where opportunity , creativity , and entrepreneurship converge .  It is a dynamic , physical and cultural hub with world-class infrastructure , Asia 's most strategic location , and a global network of talents with an impressive record of success that can support the achievement of individual 's goal , and objectives " , he said .  
The meeting , to be held on September 5 and 6 , will focus on ways to strengthen global economic growth , combating terrorist financing and money laundering , advancing fiscal and financial reforms , and improving the allocation of domestic savings for economic development .  
Apart from its high speed , the launch is equipped with advanced equipment , such as differential global positioning system , maritime radar , echo sounder , night viewer , portable search light , mobile phone and facsimile machine etc .  
" For effective regulation , the SFO provides flexibility in addressing changing market practices and global conditions by empowering the SFC and relevant authorities to prescribe detailed and technical requirements as necessary by way of subsidiary legislation , " a Government spokesman said .  
He noted that Hong Kong , as the world 's top container port and a member of the international community , had played an active and responsible role in meeting various challenges to maintain the smooth flow of containers around the global supply chain and to enhance the security of global maritime trade , citing Hong Kong 's action in response to the US 's Container Security Initiatives ( CSI ) .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
In this era of globalisation , as the world 's freest economy and a premier international finance , shipping and business centre , Hong Kong maintains constant exchanges with other economies and major cities around the world .  Many of these have become our steadfast business partners .  These global connections are crucial to Hong Kong 's future .  We must push ahead in this direction to reinforce our global market network .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
CONCLUSION Prospects for National ConstructionAccording to the estimates of prominent scholars both at home and abroad , if the industrialized nations continue their healthy growth , and if there is no drastic change in the international economic environment , the Republic of China is certain to become a developed nation by the year 2000 as a result of the expansion of the global economy and continued development in the Taiwan area .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
In Mexico , for example , 12.5 square meters of forest are burned for each 11 kilograms of formula produced . Waste from the cows creates vast amounts of methane , adding to global warming . It requires a great deal of energy to manufacture dry powdered milk from the original milk . Packaging requires the expenditure and waste of large amounts of tin , aluminum , and plastic ; for example in the U . S . 550 million empty formula tins are discarded annually , while Taiwan throws away about five million .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
As international boundaries become increasingly blurred and the global village becomes a reality , working or living overseas no longer seems unusual . Yet families divided in this way have to confront the risk of dramatic upheaval or even disintegration .  
From the international perspective , the global economy has been dragging along at a low ebb for some years now . There have been many reports of layoffs , salary cuts , and plant closings , even for established multinational giants . It was only in the middle of 1994 that light showed at the end of the tunnel , and the turnaround that is making everyone so pleased only really began then .  
As official agencies and renowned international economic think tanks release optimistic forecasts for 1995 , an American economist , Ravi Batra , has struck an independent note . As the title of his book The World Great Depression suggests , he predicts there will be a global economic disaster in 1995 .  
A new seaborne celebrity : teaFrom the astonishing beauty of 16th-century blue-and-white ware to the strange and gaudy ware of the 18th century ; from the curio cabinets of kings and nobles to the luxury dinner services of the middle classes , Chinese export porcelain captivated Europe for several centuries . Did the Europeans really never think about " technology transfer , " instead sticking respectfully to the ideal of a global village with a " global division of labor " ?  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
The international success of the Swedish group Abba , who were contemporary with Teresa Teng , just goes to prove to what extent the English language has become the exclusive medium of the global pop-music industry over the last thirty years , a phenomenon matched equally by its unrivaled position as the language of science and technology .  
We want to guide the new generation to understand their homeland , love their country and develop a broad international perspective . Thus fortified , they can better meet international challenges and map out a bright future for their country in an increasingly competitive global village .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) . This replaced the former system of multiple exporters , and introduced a unified approach to the business , with global coordination covering every stage from improved cultivar selection to production , packing , cool storage , transport , shipping , overseas distribution , marketing and promotion , " says NZKMB new project manager Stuart Abbott .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation . But rapid planting of single-species forests in previously cleared areas implies that in the future , each such area will contain only one producer species , thus limiting biodiversity and creating incomplete and fragmentary food chains .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
The rapid ascent in the late twentieth century of the " 3C " industries-the capital - and technology-intensive semiconductor industry ( ICs ) , computer component production and assembly ( PCs ) , and electronic consumer goods ( ECs ) - has given Taiwan a strong hand in terms of global economic competition .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
A turning point was reached two years ago , however , as the global Internet infrastructure began to mature . Increasingly available broadband connections offered dramatic improvements in speed , and online games began proliferating . Ever since the wave broke over Taiwan , the number Internet cafes has been growing rapidly .  
In fact , " freak " Typhoon Nari seems very much to fit the trend of climate change . Liao Chung-ming , director of National Taiwan University 's department of atmospheric sciences , says that with global warming , extreme and unusual weather patterns will occur with increasing frequency .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
In this crucial period of a strategic realignment of global political and economic forces , Taiwan needs to increase its opportunities for international exposure and actively participate in international activities , in order to make its voice heard . Only in this way can Taiwan truly manifest its national status and dignity .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
Consequently , over the last 100 years , the poles have seen an increase of 5 �X C in their average temperatures . Hence accelerated melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is one of the first symptoms of global warming . But climate can not be separated into discrete regional units .  
As a result , a region that once had a very dry climate might experience frequent rains , or an area once known for its rains might cease to see any rainfall whatsoever . Under the influence of global warming , all kinds of strange meteorological phenomena might occur , including extreme cold alternating with extreme heat in one locale .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
" For a decade or two now , researchers in other countries have been taking notice of the boost that global warming can give to disease vectors , " says Professor Wang Chiu-sen of the graduate institute of public health at National Taiwan University . The list of diseases that may be helped to spread by climate warming includes viral diseases like dengue fever , yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and parasitic diseases like filariasis and schistosomiasis .  
On the first day of TIBE President Chen Shui-bian delivered remarks at the opening ceremonies . In addition to welcoming the publishing professionals from the various countries , he emphasized that a global knowledge-based economy was now in full swing , that the creation and utilization of knowledge would be the key to competitive failure or success for countries and industries . He said the government would incorporate the " knowledge industry " into the national guiding objectives and that the publishing industry was the foundation of the knowledge industry .  
Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management . " Although this is difficult to implement-even more challenging , in fact , given the need to maintain competitiveness amidst a global downturn-it is essential .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
The recent spread of bad economic times around the globe , like the spread of a plague , can not be divorced from the changing information-era economic model . The dramatic increase in information-intensive industry , and changes in manpower demand , costs , price and market structure all influence the global economic stage .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
We witnessed how homeless people at Lungshan Temple died of cold when cold fronts swept through at Western New Year 's . The next day , the news was flooded with stories of celebrities and the details of their elegant New Year apparel ; even as frigid corpses lay in the street , the consumerist priorities of the global economy held sway , and only the goings-on of the rich were on people 's lips .  
The purpose of the WHO is defined as helping people in the entire world to enjoy the highest possible standard of health . Its main responsibilities are to offer leadership and coordination on matters related to international health , to provide technical assistance , and to promote measures to prevent epidemics , regional diseases , and other illnesses . In addition , the environment , women 's issues , food safety , and global pharmaceuticals standards also fall within the purview of the WHO .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
It was for these human rights and medical goals that the international community established the WHO . So when over 190 countries around the world fall under the protective umbrella of WHO , yet the 23 million people of Taiwan are excluded , this is not only unfair to Taiwan , it also represents a weakness in the overall global healthcare structure .  
There are signs that the international community is gradually seeing the light on this issue . If the global community comes around , then this will naturally lead the PRC to revise its way of thinking . We can only hope that with economic development , growing diversity in society , and democratization , the mainland will also move toward a more reasonable and civilized position on this issue .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
In cross-strait economic relations , this included replacing the " no haste , be patient " policy with the " active opening , effective management " policy designed to facilitate corporate global planning .  
Wu explains that the high-tech industry peaked in 1999 going into 2001 , but after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 , the global economy went into a deep recession . To make matters worse , the dot-com bubble burst in the United States , investors suffered loss after loss in the stock market , consumer spending fell , and prices continued to decline , resulting in what economists call a deflationary economy .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin . Taiwanese have always prided themselves on their adaptability and nose for the latest in global trends , but in an age in which even industrial technology comes and goes in the blink of an eye , even the most agile individual is likely to find him - or herself buffeted by time 's waves into unforeseen directions .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
In particular , since the 1970s , with universal education and the rise of individualism and feminist consciousness , the younger generations have grown accustomed to living for themselves , and are wary of entering the " trap " of marriage ; while factors such as extramarital affairs , infertility and mental illness , along with changing employment patterns due to global competition , leave those who do marry in a constant state of anxiety , never knowing when the citadel they have toiled to build may collapse around them .  
Kuo then set up the artkey company . Using the then-new medium of the Internet as an art gallery , he staged the " SohoArt " Internet art exhibition and a " Top100 artworks " national artwork poll . He also set up a global Chinese arts directory and invited 100 artists to participate in a major exhibit over the Internet , giving artists , who previously had kept a respectful distance from technology , a real opportunity to get on the web .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
Because of strong support from parents and schools , not only has there been a quantitative increase in the number of players , but a clear qualitative increase as well . Since the first breakthrough in 1999 when Chen Chin-feng signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the US , over the past several years international talent hunters have scouted more than 15 of Taiwan 's top players , and Taiwan has become a main center for the development of talent for global baseball .  
Recognize that both China and South Africa share many objectives with regard to key multilateral issues and on the urgent need for the reform of the international multilateral political , economic and financial architecture to reflect new global realities  
The world is still in a process of complicated and profound changes , with peace and development remaining the major tasks of the current world , Jiang said Peace and development are complementary and closely related to each other The UN still has much to do before lasting global peace and common development are attained , he added  
Albright said that she considered the upcoming visit a rare chance for the two countries to improve and develop their bilateral ties , saying that such ties are beneficial to the peoples of the two countries , as well as to regional and global stability " To that end , we have to seriously tackle the problems we face , " she said  
under the treaty , bilateral joint meetings of foreign ministers will be held to deal with major international and bilateral issues for the purpose of coordinating policy this , on the basis of the ec common foreign and security policies , will increasingly strengthen europe 's influence in global foreign and security affairs  
It said the authors of the report also need to address the unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets to benefit the already rich societies  
" We are ready to make efforts for greater global economic growth , but we are firm on not sacrificing our national interests in undertaking any international economic cooperation , " Jiang said at a welcoming luncheon hosted by the China Britain Business Council , stressing that this is a basic prerequisite for China on the issue  
The expansion of transnational corporation activities world wide calls for adequate governmental response , which , in the successful pursuit of national policies in an interdependent world , requires a global view .  
Indeed , the promise of global peace and security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by political and ethnic conflicts , economic and social disorder , and deepening poverty , particularly in developing countries .  
We have shouldered our responsibilities in this regard and have played an active role in international discussions to find a workable and balanced solution to global warming based on proven scientific evidence .  
In this case , pressure from the international community , including its global and regional political bodies , and the persistent efforts of certain internal and external groups led to a series of negotiations without precedent .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into at Rio was based on providing developing countries with substantial new and additional resources to meet their huge sustainabledevelopment requirements .  
Sustained and accelerated economic growth in developing countries would make for global ecological sustainability and should be central to development efforts at the national and international levels .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
Effective action at the global level was crucial in preventing and controlling the accumulation of illicit profits and in contributing to the impoverishment and weakening of criminal organizations .  
Today , spurred by concern over the potential for global warming and acid precipitation , coal is often criticized as a major source of environmental degradation at the local , regional and global levels .  
In this process , it was crucial to go beyond the limits of a technical exercise and to develop a process marked by shared ethical values where individual goals must be reconciled with global solidarity .  
With reductions in international and regional tensions , and with the growing recognition of global economic and environmental interdependence , the opportunity to mobilize human and financial resources for global problemsolving has never been greater .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
A provisional network of national focal points has also been established , representing all global regions and serving as a base on which to build the international response capacity to environmental emergencies .  
The future of coal as a major fuel is problematic , mainly because of environmental concerns at the local , regional and global levels over its contribution to local pollution , acid rain and climate change .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and to include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into during the recent years was based on the provision to the developing countries of substantial , new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .  
Yes , the varied pattern of global cultural evolution may have been successful in the degree of international consensus on democracy as a better political system and free enterprise as a preferable or more effective economic approach .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
The objective of the satellite network proposal is to provide reliable , economic and secure international telecommunications services , capable of supporting global operations 24 hours a day , seven days a week .  
In the interests of social and economic development at the global level , the international community must not forget the victims , once it had addressed the urgent political dimensions of such conflict .  
There was vast potential in the huge and sprawling machinery of the specialized agencies which could enable the United Nations to take the lead in a new global compact on social development .  
The Assembly should focus on the development of norms , standards and rules of the game required to manage global interdependence in a rapidly changing international environment and promote an integrated approach to economic and social development .  
At the intergovernmental level , it had become widely recognized that the drug problem could not be tackled on a unilateral or even a bilateral basis but , being global in nature , would require extended and improved international cooperation .  
Organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
First , they took adequate account of existing , proven regulations under international law , in line with the objective of creating as comprehensive a system as possible of mutually complementary global and regional regimes for international watercourses .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
The root causes of global conflicts had been aggravated by ethnic , religious and intercommunal divisions , which required a just and lasting radical solution in order to ensure that desperation and insecurity did not lead to insurmountable social crises .  
He referred to the recent visit to China by the SecretaryGeneral who not only pointed out the critical role of international peacekeeping in promoting global security but also the vital importance of sustainable social and economic development .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
" In making social issues a universal priority " , as the Secretary-General pointed out at the recently held World Summit for Social Development , " our intention is to take responsibility for the collective future of international society and to pledge ourselves anew to the ideal of global solidarity " .  
At every level local , national , regional , international and global there is an awareness that the United Nations , for all its setbacks , is recognized for having done so much , so well and in such a short span of time .  
Their vision can only be realized through a collective adherence to a common purpose based on the principles of equity , tolerance and social justice , by expanding human capacity and the attainment of human security through equitable development and the achievement of global sustainability .  
While the United Nations can not realistically manage all the crises occurring world wide , because of its unique role and responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security , it should seek to strengthen global political consensus on the principles of the Charter , assist , through its preventive capacity , in the formulation of regional strategies and efforts and take decisive action when regional or global security is seriously challenged .  
Geographically located near the so-called golden triangle , Thailand has consistently supported , at both the global and the regional level , international efforts aimed at the prevention , control and suppression of narcotic drugs .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In this changed world that came out of the Second World War more global and interdependent Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the vital role played by the United Nations in the preservation of peace and in solving the main problems affecting the world , and it wishes to confirm the validity of the enlightened principles of the Charter , as sound today as they were 50 years ago .  
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
These include the corrosive influence of drug production and consumption , and the corrupting effect of the movements of vast amounts of money that this traffic involves ; the degradation of the environment , from its global impact on the ozone layer to its local effect on the health of children and the elderly ; the large international migrations resulting from insecurity in the countries of origin ; the expansion of international terrorism ; and the increase in transmissible diseases such as AIDS .  
We believe that one of the essential tasks for the United Nations in striving to attain the goal of increasing global stability is to promote the progressive establishment in various parts of the world of regional zones of peace and cooperation that is , geographical areas , defined by the participants themselves , in which are applied agreed rules for coexistence and the strengthening of peace and security .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
While the first half of the twentieth century has left in the mind of mankind the haunting memories of two dreadful world wars , in the second half of this century , despite the fierce local wars that have taken place such as those in Indochina , Korea and Viet Nam nations have been spared the horrors of a global conflagration .  
The achievements of its foreign policy provide a new impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process of regional and global integration , and to participate more effectively in global forums and institutions , with a view to tackling the pressing problems facing all mankind , and to contributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of the international community to achieve peace , national independence , friendship , cooperation among States and development .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
It is but a means to an end , and it will only be meaningful if we are united in the view that a strengthened and revitalized United Nations is an imperative , given the inescapable reality of today 's global village ; that the world of the future will need more , not fewer , effective international collaborative mechanisms to confront common threats ; and that the United Nations remains the only available instrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle these challenges .  
Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are to trample through our region each year ; yet climate experts have given us notice that the phenomenon known as global warming will generate a greater number of extreme weather events , more ferocious and monstrous in each succeeding year . 
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
We hold that serious thought must be given to devising a suitable arrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our global community in its rich diversity and that is amenable to periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes in a dynamic world .  
The celebration in a few days ' time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will mark the Organization 's coming of age , and will also be an opportunity to lay the foundations for forms of international cooperation free from the ideological confrontation of the past , and directed firmly towards global challenges .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
In the current thinking about the necessary reform measures , it is vital to keep in mind the reality of the dynamic change in the global economic and social spheres , the ever growing importance of market forces and the global nature of the changes .  
Today 's world dialectically combines within itself both dangers and threats fraught with instability and the risk of new global shocks , while nourishing the growth of an essentially new and different non-confrontational system of international relations .  Through ever more active multilateral efforts in confronting common challenges , we see more clearly the basic principles of such a system .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
Far from accepting this situation as our fated lot and aware that we must rely on our own efforts , this year the African countries adopted , in Egypt , the Cairo Programme of Action , which aims at ensuring the immediate relaunching of Africa 's economic and social development through political and economic reforms and a global and coherent strategy .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
The timeliness of launching a global movement to ensure prosperity for all in this era of rapid globalization of economic activities was noted at the World Summit for Social Development , held in Copenhagen . In Sri Lanka , the Samurdhi programme is designed to activate the entrepreneurial potential of the poor . 
They also underlined the necessity to reinforce the efforts and the measures directed to safeguarding the observance of human rights , in particular those related to education and work , calling on national , regional and international organizations to support the global development of the young generation under the sign of understanding , progress and friendship .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Here I would like to echo the proposal made by President Ben Ali , Chairman of the OAU last year , for a global economic and social plan aimed at ensuring the development of Africa on a sound and lasting basis , helping our continent overcome its shortcomings and become integrated into the world economy and ensuring dignified conditions of life for all the peoples of the continent .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
We agreed , in New York in May , to the determined pursuit of global reduction of nuclear weapons , with the ultimate goal of their elimination , and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
Throughout this period , worldwide alarm , reflected in numerous United Nations resolutions , grew over the fact that the threat posed by nuclear weapons remained the single most critical global issue .  
The establishment of a conceptual link between disarmament and development by giving an impetus to more accelerated progress on the issues of global development will strengthen the roots of international peace and security and preserve the spirit of understanding , constructive cooperation and genuine political goodwill which are essential for the building of a better and more secure world . 
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it . 
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
National development policies must be designed to promote economic growth , social justice and concern for the environment ; at the same time , the international community must establish more equitable economic relations , bearing in mind the importance of protecting the global environment .  
For that reason they firmly supported the establishment of a global partnership which addressed all human rights and recognized that the universal enjoyment of human rights was hindered by the crushing debt burden and by structural adjustment programmes .  
Strengthen information , systematic observation and assessment systems for environmental , economic and social data related to land resources at the global , regional , national and local levels and for land capability and land-use and management patterns ;  
Such regional cooperative mechanisms could be facilitated through public / private partnerships and provide support to Governments , industry , non-governmental educational institutions and other domestic and international organizations , and by strengthening global professional networks ;  
Invites the working group on the agenda for development to give consideration to the proposal of the Secretary-General that advantage be taken of the presence of high-level representatives during the early part of the sessions of the General Assembly to conduct a dialogue and to convene special sessions of the Assembly on major themes relevant to the current and emerging economic and social issues in the global agenda , including those identified under the agenda for development ;  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;  
A projection of collective and global resource requirements , presented by the organizations to their respective governing body , based on approved and planned programmes , taking into account the needs of developing countries , their absorptive capacity , the themes and programmes of action agreed at world conferences and other forums , and the ability of the organization to deliver the proposed programmes ;  
In particular , the global POPIN Coordinating Unit and the regional Population Information Networks are working towards harnessing the tremendous potential of print , audiovisual and electronic media , including databases and networks , to disseminate technical information and to promote and strengthen understanding of relationships between population , consumption , production and sustainable development .  
On the basis of our common pursuit of social development , which aims at social justice , solidarity , harmony and equality within and among countries , in full respect for national sovereignty [ and territorial integrity ] , as well as policy objectives , development priorities and religious and cultural diversity , and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , we launch a global drive for social progress and development embodied in the following commitments :  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Encouraging the production of relevant studies / research to assess the consequences of global and technological changes on social integration and the production of evaluations of the policies and programmes put in place to achieve the various components of social integration ; and encouraging national and international exchanges and dissemination of information on innovative models and successful practices ;  
The following major levels of planning and management need to be distinguished : global , regional , national , provincial or district , local , municipal or village , and household or farm .  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 1994 / 51 of 3 November 1994 , in which the Council emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as women 's particupation in the peace process , in national and international governance , sustainable development and gender equality ,  
A coordinated global effort is necessary to consolidate the data available in a compatible form , and to obtain a greatly improved base of information , so that a much more detailed and precise understanding of the desertification issue can be obtained .  
Many species , such as migratory species , species dependent on the timing of ice-melting , Arctic communities , marine , coastal and peripheral populations , genetically impoverished species , mountain and alpine communities , and species that inhabit dry lands , semi-arid and arid ecosystems , are all likely to be adversely affected by global warming ; the climatic changes predicted may bring about catastrophic losses in genetic resources and species and ecosystem diversity .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Commission supports international and regional networks on in situ conservation areas ; ex situ base collection under the auspices of FAO ; the organization of a fourth international technical conference on the conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources ; and the establishment of the new global information systems for plant genetic resources and seed exchange based on the ongoing Seed Information System .  
Emphasizing that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
The international debate is increasingly concerned with how to reconcile national development objectives with such global environmental objectives as ameliorating climate change or conserving genetic pools to a degree that is often well beyond the needs of individual nation States .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly the developing countries ,  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
Taking into account that the Economic and Social Council , in its resolution 1994 / 51 , emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
Recognizing that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action is of particular significance as it will provide an opportunity to the international community to set out new and corrective policies and measures , including strengthened external support to the least developed countries in all areas , to support their efforts so as to ensure the timely , effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade ,  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
The primary objective of this programme area is to provide assessments of the current status and trends in major developmental and environmental issues at the national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
National plans and investment in science should further global environment and developmental observing systems and should strengthen internationally coordinated scientific programmes on environment and development involving relevant United Nations bodies and major international scientific bodies .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
It welcomed the active cooperation of the Statistical Division , the regional commissions and various international agencies , as well as national statistical offices , to promote , in a harmonized manner , the implementation of regional and global comparisons , and full-scale and reduced information surveys , and to explore the use of purchasing power parities for aggregation .  
Through various national , regional and global level expert consultations and conferences that involve the public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations , FAO has been increasing the awareness of the challenges and opportunities of modern biotechnologies at various levels .  
However , they were divided on the future role for UNEP ; the majority were in favour of a continued and enhanced role for UNEP and argued that environmental action demands that complex issues cutting across sectors be monitored from a global environment perspective .  
Recommendation 7 , Access to scientific data : UNEP should promote through Earthwatch a global policy of enhanced availability , within the framework of United Nations mandated programmes , of existing environmental data at the national or international levels so as to facilitate the delivery of environmental management tools intended for country decision makers .  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
In addition , the United Nations system , in coordination with other relevant organizations , is asked by Agenda 21 to provide recommendations for harmonizing the development of indicators at the national , regional and global levels , and for incorporating a suitable set of these indicators in common , regularly updated , and widely accessible reports and databases , for use at the international level , subject to national sovereignty considerations ( para . 
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
OECD has developed a typology for examining the use of trade measures for environmental purposes , based on their linkage to national and international environmental law , including multilateral environmental agreements ; and the geographical scope of the environmental problem ( domestic , transboundary , global ) .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
In the light of current global realities , it is important and timely to reverse this trend and to renew efforts to ensure that the two concepts become more closely linked at an operational level .  
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
The Division is also entrusted with the follow-up activities related to major regional and global programmes and provides advisory services on the administrative mechanisms for environmentally sound exploitation and utilization of natural resources , population policies and programmes and environmental conservation management .  
At the national level , United Nations resident coordinators are actively participating in the preparatory activities for the Conference and are assisting in promoting South-South cooperation on urban management at the regional and global levels .  
An international symposium on sources of innovation in multilateralism was held , in cooperation with the University of Lausanne , Switzerland , in May to re-examine the nature of global changes and the challenges posed to the United Nations , including its reform proposals , as well as emerging new social forces such as women 's movements , endogenous peoples , human rights activists and others . 
The symposium , held in April and attended by more than 300 scholars , diplomats , NGO representatives , religious leaders , and journalists , addressed issues of peace and security , development , environment , and shared universal human values and norms that go beyond the concept of international cooperation in the " global neighbourhood " .  
Parliamentary documentation .  ( i ) Four reports to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on the extent and developments in illicit traffic , with statistical and descriptive material , and analysis at the regional and global levels ; and ( ii ) contributions to the reports to regional meetings ( subsidiary bodies of the Commission ) on trends in illicit drug trafficking ;  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .

The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
The Commission noted that participation in the pilot phase is voluntary and that activities implemented jointly should be compatible with and supportive of national environment and development priorities and strategies , contribute to cost-effectiveness in achieving global benefits and be conducted in a comprehensive manner covering all relevant sources , sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases .  
The Commission notes with concern that the growing recognition of the need to address patterns of production and consumption has not yet been matched by a full understanding of the implications of such patterns on economic , social and environmental conditions at the local , national and global levels .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .

Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
In this regard , Earthwatch is exploring the potential to use schools , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , the media and other groups in building a more complete picture of the status of species , land uses , development activities , pollution problems and other characteristics of the human and natural environment as inputs for state-of-the-environment reporting and as a basis for selective continued monitoring of national and global trends and for filling data gaps .  
Further proposed action included the development of a holistic normative framework to facilitate the cooperation of all concerned in meeting conflicting demands on land resources while avoiding land degradation , as well as the negotiation of regional or subregional cooperative agreements on mountains , possibly leading to the development of a global mountain charter and action plan .  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .

In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .

demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .

Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .

We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
The ever-dwindling natural resource base , global warming , persistent droughts and desertification are eloquent reminders that humankind 's current destructive processes of growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
Our Organization , which was designed to respond to both global challenges and to the needs of its Member States , will not be able to play its double role in the coming century unless it can count on a sound , solid and stable financial basis .  
Belize has proposed that we should establish an annual special session of this Assembly immediately prior to the general debate , at which we would discuss development policy and regenerate the political will necessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for Development and the commitments made in this Assembly , as well as at the high-level global conferences of this last decade of the twentieth century .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
Tunisia 's steadfast efforts to consolidate the foundations of the country 's political institutions and the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights in their global dimension flow from a civilized , irreversible choice made in accordance with universal values .

If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
They should , inter alia , pave the way for the active and global participation of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , in the work and procedures of the United Nations , including the Economic and Social Council , bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these countries in the economic and social challenges facing today 's world .  
With the new global changes , with our recent adoption of the CTBT , with rising optimism regarding the Conference on Disarmament , with what can be perceived as a genuine desire for peace , and with more meaningful international collaboration in the areas of economic cooperation and development , there is some hope for achieving lasting peace and security in our world .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
We believe that , with the treaties and bilateral agreements concluded , and the ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States , and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year , the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
Intensified cooperation on their part with the United Nations system at the global , regional and national levels in the area of economic and social development would be most desirable to ensure coherent development efforts to produce fruitful results .  
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
With its unique approach , the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was aimed at renewing the commitment of African countries and the international community to an agenda for the sustainable social and economic development of Africa in a spirit of global partnership based on shared responsibilities .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
The participants in the Forum supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November , which would be marked by global exchanges of television programmes focusing particularly on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchange .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
The UNEP contribution will also include , depending on the availability of funds , establishment of regional expert panels to develop suitable classification systems and to evaluate the accuracy and utility of national , continental and global data sets being developed under land-cover characterization studies .  
FAO concluded that such surveys , if continued over time , would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis .  
Within the framework of its inputs to ongoing and planned global environmental programmes such as GTOS , FAO will continue its cooperation with organizations within the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other international organizations by providing remote sensing expertise and by participating in pilot studies in areas within its mandate . 
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment , as well as climate monitoring and medium-range , long-range , seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction .  
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
The international community has already defined a number of indicators relevant to reproductive health , and WHO is working on additional qualitative and quantitative indicators for global monitoring ;  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
In fact , the application of light detection and ranging ( lidar ) instruments was considered an extremely promising new way of obtaining essential atmospheric and geophysical parameters on a global scale .  
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development : ( a ) the back scatter lidar , with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology ; ( b ) the differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) , which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity , temperature and pressure ; ( c ) the Doppler lidar , with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies ; and ( d ) the ranging and altimeter lidar , which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth 's surface features .  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
To support standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
[ We believe that attaining these goals will promote a world more stable and free from injustice and conflict and contribute to just , comprehensive and lasting peace and to global equitable economic and social development and environmental protection . ]  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
Undertaking the valuation of the goods and services of a forest at local , national , regional and global levels is a complex and costly exercise that must be carried out in response to specific demands and guided by the type of decisions for which the results are to be used .  
This approach provides the necessary base for moving towards sustainable land-use systems within which forests are clearly recognized as an option with its own validity in contributing to sustainability at local , national and global levels . 
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
A specialized forum should be established , possibly within the United Nations system , to discuss the range of mobile and fixed communications applications that could support the new national and global economic policies and to provide integral solutions aimed at specific economic sectors . 
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
Although there was a growing interest in mobile communications , their development would depend on the evolution of important factors , such as technological progress , the availability of orbital positions ( for geostationary satellites ) , spectral bandwidths , costs and performance to satisfy a wide range of applications and the capability to provide truly global services .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
This has been accompanied by increasing concern for the environment , and notable improvements in specific fuel consumption , primarily driven by economic considerations , resulting in lower emissions of CO2 ( currently estimated at 3 per cent of the global total ) and particulates than would otherwise have occurred . 
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions , a global average of one third ( varying by region from one seventh to two thirds ) of the existing global forested area is likely to undergo a change in broad vegetation types , with the most changes occurring in high latitudes and fewer in the tropics .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
Prices of internationally traded goods ( measured in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) ) are expected to change only marginally over the short term , as productivity increases , trade is further liberalized and competitive forces ( including in commodity markets ) contribute to keep global inflationary pressures at bay .  
This continuing rise in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases poses potentially substantial risks to global physical and ecological systems , human health and socio-economic sectors .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Agence for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law by the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
In the same resolution , the Secretary-General was requested to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money-laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The requested oral report on the preparation of a plan for the integration of existing information on mineral resource potential collected by the United Nations system , other organizations and Member States , on an ongoing basis so as to develop a global understanding will not be presented due to the lack of necessary resources available to prepare the plan . 
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
The Working Group recognized - as stated in the Washington Declaration adopted by the Conference - participating Governments ' intention to act to develop , in accordance with the provisions of the Global Programme of Action , adopted by the Conference , a global , legally binding instrument for the reduction and / or elimination of emissions , discharges and , where appropriate , the elimination of the manufacture and use of persistent organic pollutants that had been identified in decision 18 / 32 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .  
The Group recognized - as stated in the Washington Declaration adopted by the Conference - participating Governments ' intention to act to develop , in accordance with the provisions of the Global Programme of Action adopted by the Conference , a global , legally binding instrument for the reduction and / or elimination of emissions , discharges and , where appropriate , the elimination of the manufacture and use of persistent organic pollutants identified in decision 18 / 32 of the UNEP Governing Council .  
In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
It emphasized that the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility for developing and developed countries , as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , should be applied in any development of measures to protect the atmosphere on a global scale .  
Global statistical surveys and methodologies for data collection and the development of indicators , especially for use at the national level , are crucial for comprehensive and uniform data collection from which global trends can be identified , which are in turn the basis for intergovernmental policy recommendations .  
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
The evolution of the relative shares of each of the most important sources of energy in total global consumption , the dynamics of structural change in the global energy system , and the relative shares of different primary energy sources in global primary energy show that it took about half a century before coal was replaced by crude oil as the dominant global energy source .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
Both sides believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to formulate an Agenda for Development based on General Assembly resolutions and hope that the conclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development will help the international community achieve the objective of sustainable development , contribute to the economic growth and social development of the developing countries and promote international cooperation and global development .  
Provided effective support to standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
The general orientation of this programme is to promote more effective international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice by devising strategies to deal with global problems and by assisting Governments in their national and multilateral efforts to respond to changing crime trends , as well as to create the necessary instruments and institutions for a more accountable , transparent and effective crime prevention and control system .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
In order to develop the regional capabilities to foresee effectively upcoming trends and challenges , the fourth objective is to facilitate monitoring and assessing of new development processes and their projections , including summaries of major projected global trends in aspects that are relevant to the region .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
The main focus of the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Department of Public Information , is to raise global awareness of Africa 's critical economic situation and of the actions taken by Africa and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the continent .  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
In order to support the new global and integrated approach to human rights based on the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which emphasized the interrelated and interdependent nature of all human rights , it will be necessary to organize both short-term and long-term training in the various dimensions of human rights to ensure that all staff and those joining the Programme enjoy a broad knowledge of human rights from the United Nations perspective .  
Regional development and global changes included published studies on the impact of the single European market on ESCWA countries ; privatization in the Gulf countries and in Arab countries with more diversified economies ; and on industrial strategies in the ESCWA region within a changing international and regional environment .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and microtopographical data of the Area ;  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
The preparation of such a diagnostic framework would enable each country to undertake its own analysis of the conditions specific to it ; it would allow a wide range of national factors to be taken into account , particularly the interaction of different sectoral policies , and a nation 's international obligations ; and it would draw attention , where appropriate , to those circumstances in which global or external influences were important as driving forces of change . 
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Countries to contribute to periodic forest resources assessments by ( i ) nominating a focal point for cooperation with the FRA secretariats and ( ii ) providing , on a continuing basis , the information needed for the regional and global forest resources assessments , irrespective of whether it originates from official or unofficial ( expert estimates ) sources ;  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
The basic NFP principles recognize the following key elements ( see document E / CN . 17 / IPF / 1996 / 8 ) : national sovereignty ; integration with a country 's sustainable development strategy ; partnership ; participation ; a holistic and intersectoral approach ; a long-term iterative process ; capacity-building ; policy and institutional reforms ; consistency with national policy frameworks and global initiatives ; awareness-raising ; and harmony with national and international commitments .  
To achieve an overview of the relevance of existing international legal instruments to the conservation , management and sustainable use of all types of forests and their relation to issues on the global forest agenda , the present report provides a comprehensive summary of multilateral instruments that are relevant to forest use and conservation .  
While the global Secretariat relies on its existing staff to carry out its established work programme and implement the various mandates entrusted to it , it does occasionally experience the need for supplementing established staffing resources on a short-term basis to respond to specific mandates or requests from Member States , or to meet the demands of peak periods in areas subject to sharp and often unpredictable workload fluctuations .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The full value of forests , wooded lands and trees and their contribution to social , economic and environmental well-being at the local , national , regional and global levels must be recognized .  
The accords , commitments and internationally agreed targets reached at United Nations global conferences and United Nations organs , in the multifaceted and interrelated issues of the environment , population , social development , crime , the advancement of women , human settlements , trade and development and public administration should be fully implemented by all States and international organizations .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
Since it may be easier to negotiate and implement , country certification may not only lay the groundwork for more comprehensive international forest product certification agreements but also buy time , by initiating immediate incentives for action on sustainable forest management while the details of more complicated agreements on certification for all global forest products from natural and plantation forests are concluded .  
At the 1996 meeting of the group of seven major industrialized countries held in France in June , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States issued a final communiqu calling upon all States to spare no effort in securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines .  
The international programme is designed to address issues of global concern in a comprehensive and integrated manner with strong and distinct national and regional characteristics and with the objective of improving women 's status in employment in both quantitative and qualitative terms .  
The prospective growth environment for developing countries will depend not only on their continuing significant policy adjustments but also on sustained and strong momentum in global trade liberalization leading to rapid growth in world trade .  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .  
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
" The use of chemicals is essential to protect public health and increase food production , but unregulated use of toxic chemicals or uncontrolled disposal of hazardous wastes threaten the environment and human health " In the second sentence , before the words " monitor and assess global trends " insert the words " through the work of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal , " ;  
The final communiqu of the meeting addressed issues relevant to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , including strengthening economic and monetary cooperation ; promoting strong and mutually beneficial growth of trade and investment ; enhancing the approach to employment problems ; implementing a new global partnership for development ; enhancing the effectiveness of multilateral institutions for the benefit of development ; providing necessary multilateral support for development ; and successful integration into the global economy of countries with economies in transition .  
A set of agreed conclusions was adopted ( agreed conclusions 1996 / 1 ) , in which the Council stressed the important role played by the United Nations system in the overall effort for poverty eradication and in assisting Member States in translating the global goals and commitments of the international conferences and the statutory mandates of each organization into concrete actions and activities at all levels .  
Towards that end , they resolved seriously to consider fresh policy options in order to give proper effect to the segments of the Final Declaration of the Fourth Conference , held at Pyongyang , dealing with South-South cooperation as a key element in increasing information capabilities at the national , regional and global levels .  
Full observance of the principle of shared responsibility will lead to more effective results that reflect a comprehensive and balanced view of the drug problem , which will enable us to interlink national , regional and global efforts , in accordance with the principles of international law .  
This series of global conferences have proved invaluable in raising awareness of human and environmental conditions around the world and in enjoining national Governments and the international community to act to improve those conditions .  
Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to ensure effective coordination of the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and adequate consideration of human settlements needs in all activities of the United Nations system , and to include the implementation of the Habitat Agenda in the agenda of the ACC machinery , and in the mandates of the thematic task forces that are promoting an integrated and coordinated follow-up , at the inter-agency level , of the outcomes of recent global conferences .

Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
The Council , in its resolution 1995 / 11 of 24 July 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
During the last 40 years , the Congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  
The Committee agreed that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies , should actively contribute to making the special session a highly visible international event that would energize global commitment to the implementation of Agenda 21 and advance international dialogue and action for sustainable development .  
Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with all countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty , contributing to a cleaner global environment and living conditions , enhancement of confidence and strengthening of international security , aimed at a more secure and healthy world .  
Policy interactions and programme cooperation are also being expanded in the context of the arrangements made by ACC to promote the integrated follow-up to recent United Nations global conferences ( the World Bank chairs the thematic ACC task force on the enabling environment and participates actively , together with the International Monetary Fund , in two other inter-agency task forces on basic social services for all and on employment and sustainable livelihood ) , and of the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa .  
In conclusion , on the basis of its experiences and achievements in promoting human rights , Tunisia has been able to incorporate establishment of the rule of law in a global approach , to initiate a process of economic , social and cultural development , and to promote human rights in all their dimensions , both at the structural level and at the level of day-to-day practice and procedures .

Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Finally , the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities for the promotion of human rights ; details about these activities at the national , regional and global level are outlined in the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights ( see E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 ) .  
Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
Third , the multilateral system should be strengthened ; in that regard , the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , to be held in Singapore , would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Mr . MWAKAWAGO ( United Republic of Tanzania ) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair : hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future , and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty , especially in developing countries , which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership , unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated .  
Endorses the establishment of a global contraceptive commodity programme , to be managed by the United Nations Population Fund , and funded with an initial capitalization of $ 5 million , as set out in paragraph 23 of document DP / FPA / 1996 / 3 , as an integral component of the overall work of the Fund in strengthening reproductive health programmes , including family planning and sexual health , and emphasizes that these activities should be monitored carefully to ensure that they adhere to technical standards of safety and quality ;  
Requests the Executive Director to arrange an overall independent and external evaluation of the global contraceptive commodity programme at a time to be decided by the Executive Board , particularly with regard to its impact on national capacity-building in order to provide the Board with the information required to make a decision on whether the programme should be continued or ended .  
The overall objective , strengthening civil society , is pursued on a country-by-country , regional , interregional and global basis , through the provision of assistance to national non-governmental organizations in the form of training courses on human rights , fellowships and support of appropriate projects developed by them .  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
It was in its endeavour to take up the challenge of providing these people with their basic minimum energy needs that the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , in a broad-based partnership with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , international organizations and concerned governmental and non-governmental organizations , launched in 1993 a global initiative : a three-year-long communication process known as the World Solar Summit Process .  
The Programme is conceived as a necessary global commitment and a major coordinated effort of the various national and international actors to develop and implement more than 300 top-priority renewable energy projects of national , regional and international value within a 10-year period in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility , economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar energy .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
Women 's empowerment at the national , regional and global level required a multidimensional approach in the cultural , economic , political and social fields .  
Mr . AL-MUALLA ( United Arab Emirates ) said that the international community had in recent years set about elaborating plans for the advancement of women that were in keeping with contemporary aspirations for global progress towards societies in which women and men played complementary and active roles in meeting the needs of national , regional and international development .  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
Professor Bert Bolin , Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , referring to the paragraph in the Summary for Policy Makers in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC in which it was stated that " the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate " , said that the paragraph in question had been agreed upon after an extensive discussion and very careful consideration by governments , in view of the importance of the key finding for policy makers . 
It is further recognized that such improvement of the quality of emission data , in addition to improving the transparency and comparability of national emissions inventories , also improves knowledge of the relationship between global emissions and resulting atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , and therefore aids significantly the task of estimating the emission limitations or reductions required to achieve a given concentration level of greenhouse gases , the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention . 
Important objectives for further development of global and regional legal regimes and management policies would be the re-establishment of a balance between fishing efforts and fishing yields , proper enforcement of agreed conservation measures , the regulation and control of all catches ( including those from the high seas ) and the offsetting of all catches ( including discards ) against the determined quotas for each stock .  
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
In general , his delegation was satisfied with the priorities identified in the Note , but agreed with other delegations that both the disarmament issue and the question of effective and coordinated response to global issues such as drugs , crime and the environment , should also be considered as potential priority areas .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
While the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) , which was adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 46 / 151 of 18 December 1991 , represented a global compact between African countries on the one hand and the international community on the other , the conclusions and recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee submitted for adoption at this session constitute a set of common and complementary objectives and targets to be implemented in an integrated manner and in a spirit of full partnership .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
India fully supported the need for global efforts to address the whole range of refugee-related problems , including their security and protection , international solidarity and burden-sharing , supporting the capacity of host States to receive and protect refugees , seeking sustainable solutions to refugee problems within countries of origin in order to prevent new exoduses , developing durable solutions and creating conditions for the repatriation of refugees in a manner that ensured their safety and their effective reintegration .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and micro-topographical data of the Area ;  
The European Union believed that the medium-term plan should reflect the political parameters established at the recent global conferences , promote their integrated implementation and assess the organizational needs , including the administrative and budgetary resources required to facilitate the implementation of the commitments undertaken . 
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
He regretted that the Department had not been more responsive to and supportive of Ukraine 's unprecedented contribution to nuclear disarmament and diminishing the global nuclear threat , which had not received adequate international recognition .  
The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .

Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .  
" Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
The commitments , recommendations and measures agreed upon at recent major international conferences must be implemented in a spirit of mutual accountability and cooperation , and in a new global partnership addressing the critical social and economic issues of development .  
The series of major international conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations since 1990 had created broad public awareness of the existence of global problems and of the fact that their solution required joint efforts by States and by all of the world 's inhabitants .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,

Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Developing countries ' growing leverage in the global trade system was based on raw economic power : they currently accounted for a quarter of world trade and , if current trends continued , this figure could reach 40 per cent by the year 2010 and over half by 2020 .  
All available tools - trade , investment and structural adjustment - must be brought to bear on the problem of the marginalization of least developed countries , and there must be close cooperation between WTO , various organs of the United Nations system , the Bretton Woods organizations , and the various regional bodies to ensure that the resources and expertise of the international community remained focused , coordinated and relevant to the most pressing global needs . 
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
CHAVES ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that desertification and drought were global problems caused by the interaction of topographical , biological , cultural , political , social and economic factors . 
The issues of the environment and development required a global rather than a selective approach ; for the developing countries , the eradication of poverty , together with economic and social development , remained the first priorities and should be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development .  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
In introducing the item , Rabbi Cooper stated that although the Internet represented a breakthrough for education , personal freedom of expression and global democratization , it was also a tool being utilized by small but committed groups seeking to promote agendas ranging from terrorism to racial violence and divisiveness .  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
" Recalling also that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities , and standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate or of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries ,  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
For the appropriate management of high seas fisheries as well as that of the exclusive economic zones , the developed countries should transfer the necessary technology to developing countries to enable them better to conduct scientific research , handle data and pursue fisheries operations in a more responsible manner .  We now face the formidable task of implementing the comprehensive global framework of ocean management .  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
During the Forum , broadcasters from both the public and private sectors had supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November by global exchanges of television programmes focusing in particular on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchanges .  
The participants in the forum supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November , which would be marked by global exchanges of television programmes , focusing particularly on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development , and the enhancement of cultural exchange .  
[ Urged ] [ ( iv ) Urging ] Governments to promote digital mapping ( using geographical information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) combined with social mapping for establishing forest holdings and values ; assisting planning and management partnerships ; and assisting in the [ location of cultural and ] [ storage of ] geographical information required to support [ sustainable forest management schemes ; ] [ the management , protection and use of TFRK ] ;  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Nonetheless , the ] [ The Panel was convinced of the necessity of having a set of criteria and indicators wide enough to be used at the global level , rather than a reduced core set that might prevent the mutual recognition of regional and national initiatives , the exchange of information and the further elaboration of the issues of best forest practices and voluntary codes .  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
Through the series of global conferences on interlocking economic and social issues , the United Nations has been providing an ongoing democratic process through which a new international consensus on and framework for development can be built .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
The international community should call for the establishment of an international non _ governmental organization _ World Women 's Watch _ which would prepare country _ by _ country reports on key aspects of legal discrimination and on progress towards gender _ related targets fixed by national Governments and international forums ; promote the creation of ombudswomen at national and global levels to facilitate women 's access to the legal system ; encourage legal literacy campaigns to make women aware of their legal rights and to encourage them to study law through the generous provisions of scholarships ;  
Also , both the Teledesic Corporation and Sky Station International declared that they would provide some of their telecommunications capacity free of charge to developing countries , meaning several regions and countries would have free access to some of the fastest communications available for health or educational purposes .  NULLBecause of the tremendous advances in telecommunications technology , a new global community is emerging .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
These conferences provided a starting point for a global effort in advancing sustainable development , set goals and defined broad plans of action that provided the basis on which national and international actions could proceed .  
It is indeed commendable that this Japanese initiative is not restricted to Africa , but also includes the evolution of a new development strategy responsive to the present international development climate , and is providing the motivating force for a concerted global effort .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
Many times during the biennial conferences held since 1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that use French as a common language one country out of four in the world have recognized the role of multilateralism in the new international context and confirmed their will to help find a solution to global political and economic problems .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
It describes the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 51 / 18 of 14 November 1996 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .  
The main objectives of the Andean Community are to promote the balanced and harmonious development of the member countries on an equal basis through integration and economic and social cooperation ; to accelerate economic and social growth and generate employment ; to reduce vulnerability to external factors and to improve the position of member countries in the global economic context ; and to strengthen subregional solidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of development among its members .  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
The region \ x { e5b8 } constant focus on democracy , good governance , peace , security and nuclear disarmament ; its undertaking to take responsibility for the proper and responsible management of the environment ; the protection of fish and other marine resources ; cultural and technology exchanges ; and economic cooperation and respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone is successfully dealing with a changing global environment .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
We have stressed on numerous occasions , including from this rostrum , that the global confrontation between two systems has given way to equally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry within them the potential for enormous destruction , thereby posing the same global challenge to international security .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
My predecessor , the late President Cheddi Jagan , challenged the international community on many occasions to strive for a new global human order , a development paradigm which would seek simultaneously to achieve optimal economic growth , social equity , poverty reduction and protection of the environment : a development model rooted in a partnership that seeks a better balance within and among States .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
With this positive landscape in international relations and expectations , the United Nations embarked upon a series of unprecedented global conferences addressing key issues facing mankind , ranging from environment , human rights , population , social development , women and human settlements to food security . 
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
National strategies of economic reform and international cooperation must incorporate strong concern for the social implications in order to enhance the positive and minimize the negative effects of the global economy .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
The required data included the entire cross-border activity of firms , including trade in goods and services ; investment , both outbound and inbound ; and an indication of the relationship of the firms involved in such activity , such as affiliated firms operating as part of a global production network versus arms-length transactors .  
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Some other issues that will require increased research activities in the future are related to ( a ) the pathways of man-made chemicals , in particular toxic chemicals , in ecosystems , agro-ecosystems and the global biosphere and the possible undesirable biological effects in humans and animals subsisting often far away from the source point ; and ( b ) interdisciplinary research on re-emerging tropical and subtropical diseases conditioned by particular environments and vectors .  1 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , vol .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
Measures should be taken to prevent the introduction and use of unrelated , irrelevant and inappropriate issues by more powerful countries as a means of gaining advantage in global trade and investment , or as unfair leverage in imposing inappropriate conditions and policies on dependent countries .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
To address the issue of the lack of the critical long-term data necessary to understand global environmental problems , international organizations and the scientific community have designed observing systems to make data collection more coherent and cost-effective .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
Australia 's own decision to suspend the use of anti _ personnel landmines and to support the negotiation of a global ban as soon as possible was not taken without considerable soul _ searching given that the defence challenge for Australia is to be able to protect a vast continent with a small professional armed force .  
Against this background , allow me to defend the global approach which offers us the advantage of being more rational because it avoids piecemeal perceptions , wiser because it allows for the establishment of the balances necessary in any negotiations , and finally fairer because it does not marginalize anyone ; quite the contrary , it rejects measures that are not lasting and calculations that are narrow and brings all those involved together in the same creative synergy . 
We need to pursue these relevant Utopias and I believe the programme proposed by the 28 countries should be considered in the light of the present international context , but also within the expanding horizon of an international disarmament agenda which is intended to have a decisive impact on the status quo and advance even further the swing of the pendulum in the global security system . 
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
Aspects of organized crime , violence against women and violence in the society , in particular as evident in the alarming increase in xenophobic and racist behaviour in some countries , were all topics that could benefit from information exchange and concerted global efforts and at the same time would address some of the pressing issues facing UNHCR as the refugee protection agency . 
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
The rapid development and enthusiasm for the clearing-house mechanism illustrates the widely recognized need for reliable and accurate information to ensure effective implementation of the CBD . The exercise has also demonstrated the complexity of establishing an effective and accessible global clearing-house mechanism .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
It is paradoxical that UNEP , an organization that has over the last 20 years played a major role in the development of systems designed to monitor the global environment , has no discernible internal system for monitoring the substantive progress of and results produced by its projects or programmes .  
JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .  
To this end , the resident representatives worked in partnership throughout 1996 with all relevant headquarters units , particularly with ( a ) the regional bureaux , which provided the supporting management framework , advice , training and , together with the Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) , assistance in matching core competencies with country office needs and ( b ) the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support ( BPPS ) , which supplied analytical tools , developed in consultation with country offices , global studies and methodological guidance .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
There is little question that their social and economic potential is enormous , but so too are the risks that those without the capabilities to design , produce and use the new products and service applications may be disadvantaged or excluded from participating actively in their local communities and in the global information society .  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .  
As shown in the upper right-hand box of figure 3 , if the rules of the game , including intellectual property rights , standards and tariffs for access to global networks , are put in place for the GII on a highly cooperative basis , and if competitive forces are strong , then a balanced environment of competition and cooperation among ICT companies will emerge .  
The work of UNIFEM consists of bringing the reality of women 's lives at the local level " upstream " , so that they become a factor in policy-making and economic decisions at the governmental level , in corporate decision-making and within the global consensus forged through United Nations mechanisms .  
In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , given the need for a transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources , the Board recommends a sustained programme of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on renewable energy , where reasonable , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary , from global sources , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) . 
Road transport and other forms of transportation to a lesser extent , impose social costs in the form of accidents ; damage to human health from particulate matter , carbon monoxide , lead , volatile organic compounds and other pollutants ; congestion ; noise nuisance ; community severance , the " barrier effect " ; local air pollution ; transboundary air pollution from nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides ; and global warming from carbon dioxide emissions .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
At the global level , ACC has established a number of inter-agency groups in order to provide integrated support for country-level action on interrelated themes , namely basic social services for all ; enabling environment for economic and social development ; employment and sustainable livelihoods ; women and gender equality ; and sustainable development .  
The national communication includes aggregated emission estimates using global warming potentials ( GWP ) , with CO2 emissions contributing 80 per cent of total emissions expressed as CO2 equivalent , methane ( CH4 ) 12 per cent , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) 7 per cent and indirect GHG nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) ,  
It is against this background that my country participated in the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) conference held in South Africa from 19 to 21 May 1997 , in which African countries agreed to develop inter _ African cooperation in mine clearance and victim assistance , and to encourage member States to become parties to relevant international instruments governing anti _ personnel landmines , in addition to supporting and promoting efforts to achieve a global ban .  
Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Review the salient issues in the regional strategies and action programmes emerging from recent global conferences , international conventions and agreements ; monitor the implementation of Agenda 21 at the regional level ; and articulate the region 's response to relevant global initiatives , ensuring that such initiatives support the development of the region .  
There is an increased use in the region of satellite imagery and global positioning systems ( GPS ) ; geodetic networks are being improved ; and there is a continuing need to maintain topographic and thematic mapping and a priority need to produce data and maps in support of cadastre .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at UNCED and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
Recognizing also that coordinated follow _ up implies that the major conferences should be viewed as interlinked and contributing to an integrated framework of and a global partnership for development ; in this context , major cross _ cutting themes established in the world conferences need to be identified and built upon ,  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
The international community has learned that the most pressing developmental issues facing today 's world - poverty and social development , population , governance , gender equality , environment - transcend both sectoral and national boundaries , and effective responses must be multidimensional and global .  
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .  The guidelines included several aspects : prior informed consent and consultation with indigenous peoples ;  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
In the coming months , Canada would continue to promote action in favour of sustainable development at various important regional and global meetings , and it was committed to cooperating for the achievement of satisfactory results at the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
With the advent of the twenty-first century , we now face an historic choice as to what kind of a world we should bring to the new century .  The Chinese delegation holds that the international community should work to establish a just and rational new international political and economic order to ensure global and regional security .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
On the understanding that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people are addressed , the Assembly also stresses the need to strengthen coordination with those departments , agencies and bodies responsible for development activities , in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for development .  
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
Newly emerging phenomena , such as the possibility of long-term climate change with the expectation of disastrous effects on a global scale or , better known , periodic seasonal or geographical anomalies such as the El Ni �� Southern Oscillation phenomenon , create further uncertainties and new challenges for institutionalized warning practices .  
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
The preparation of a high-resolution digital mosaic of the ice sheet and exposed portions of the continent will help to better understand why changes in the ice sheet occur , providing more insight into the effects of human activity and global warming on the rapid retreat of large portions of the shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .  
It was emphasized that the original raison d \ x { 76bb } re of trade preferences in providing developing countries with preferred market access to their major markets is even more relevant in the present world of heightened global competition juxtaposed with continuing supply-side difficulties in developing countries .  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
At the international level there is a public information strategy the aim of which might be described as consciousness-raising , including straightforward dissemination of information on the humanitarian consequences of landmine use as well as advocacy designed to assist the process of imposing a global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
In order to provide a pragmatic focus for the broad and ideal goals of the Plan of Action during the second decade of its implementation , a practical strategy on ageing was developed in 1992.3 The strategy consists of eight global targets on ageing for the year 2001 and 38 suggested national targets on ageing . 
Taking note also of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-first annual meeting , [ 3 ] held in New York on 26 September 1997 , in which the Ministers emphasized the increasing importance and complementarity of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries as a means of supporting and broadening the global partnership in international development cooperation ,  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
Though the end of the cold war has greatly reduced the threat of another global war , which twice in this century brought untold sorrow to mankind , intra-country conflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in several countries , with resultant loss of lives , destruction of national infrastructure , displacement of innocent persons and outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
Such rampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the currency and equity markets of developing countries , at a time when they are still feeling their way in a world of fierce global competition , would trigger off a defensive reflex on the part of the affected countries , thereby arousing anti-liberalization , which would be detrimental to free trade .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
In this era of accelerating change in so many areas in every portion of our diverse global community , it is of singular importance to the well-being of each of our individual national communities , as it is for the overall international global community , that we recognize , observe and be faithful to those values and principles which , inherently , are unchanging .  
Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
This will enable the Organization to meet the daunting challenges of economic development faced by our global community and those posed by the political and ideological differences afflicting nations today .  
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .  
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
The issues he articulated the imperative of development cooperation based on common concerns ; shared values ; solidarity and responsibility to each other ; the need for more resolute action at the international level to address the problem of widening global inequalities and marginalization are issues that require broad debate . 
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
Also , as the Secretary-General has noted elsewhere , the transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting the fulfilment of even national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
We warmly commend the timely initiative taken by Canada in convening earlier this month an international meeting of countries that have committed themselves and taken national action to advance a global ban on anti-personnel landmines .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
Given that existing global stocks of nuclear arsenals number over 30,000 , with the equivalent explosive force of 200,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs , it is imperative that the international community press on , with unremitting vigour , with the global campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
The fact that some of these States have taken these courageous decisions , notwithstanding that they perceive considerable security threats in their respective regions , highlights their commendable long-range vision that only through personal example and truly global action will the Convention be able to achieve its ultimate goal of complete universality .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
In discussing its terms of reference , Committee members attached particular importance to ( a ) assessing world development trends and prospects ; ( b ) identifying national and international policies that would enhance the ability of developing countries and economies in transition to participate effectively in a globalizing world economy and achieve the goals agreed at United Nations global conferences ; and ( c ) undertaking periodic reviews of the list of least developed countries and the criteria used for identifying them .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
They should have institutional arrangements that are flexible , democratic , transparent and responsive to changing global and regional conditions .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .  
That global programme set up through United Nations inter-agency cooperation and underpinned by strong support at the national level in many countries , facilitated the establishment of a network of representative basins , improving understanding of hydrology and water resource management .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
Modelled , to the extent feasible , after the global guidelines for national plans of action , national or provincial guidelines for local plans should be particularly attentive to , and inclusive of , the strategic objectives of partnership , enablement , participation , capacity-building and networking .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels . 
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
This analysis is considered a starting point and focuses on two main elements : ( a ) global interception rates at a time of expansion of international trade and transportation and improved illicit drug trafficking methods ; and ( b ) law enforcement approaches applied in order to improve interception rates and their range of application in selected key trafficking regions .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
It requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of the phenomena and to include in her next report information on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit traffic , as well as information on persons killed , maimed or injured in developing countries through this heinous act .  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
In paragraphs 5 to 8 of the resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit plans for sharing the costs of establishing and operating a global networking facility with United Nations specialized agencies and programmes ; to report on requirements for network services ; to propose formulas for cost sharing ; to provide comprehensive information concerning location of telecommunications facilities in Member States ; and to show clearly the costs of telecommunications attributable to peacekeeping operations .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
Close to 40 formal case-studies were commissioned and three very successful international workshops were held , with financial support mobilized from a wide variety of sources : a regional workshop for Africa ( Dakar , June 1995 ) ; an international workshop for Asia and other regions ( Madras , February 1996 ) ; and a global meeting during the Habitat II .  
The recent adoption of the amended Protocol II to the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention is considered by many as an incomplete measure , lacking an important degree of efficiency , inadequate in coping with the global scourge of anti _ personnel landmines towards the eventual elimination of these horrendous weapons .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Regarding data processing and archiving , the Subcommittee noted that to fully exploit the potential of already acquired and future research data , more international cooperation was needed for their proper archiving , to ensure global free access to databases , to develop mechanisms for improving access to meta-data , and to agree on formats and software packages for data conversion that were necessary for scientific research .  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
The holistic approach to human rights requires , however , that particular attention be paid to the areas of human rights which are currently in a weaker position : from a global perspective , economic , social and cultural rights require further attention in determining their contents and strengthening the means and methods of their realization . 
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .  
Complementary efforts for the provision of technical support by a variety of national , regional and international organizations should be encouraged and coordinated in strengthening global spatial data infrastructure activities .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Global Knowledge 97 will address a fundamental challenge facing developing countries and the international development community in the information age : given the vital role of knowledge in economic and social development , how can developing countries , and in particular the worlds poor , harness knowledge for development , participate in the global information economy and gain access to new tools for life-long learning ?  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
This is also necessary for an optimal combination with emerging satellite systems , which are complementary to terrestrial systems and fundamental for the rapid global expansion of services .  
Some of the specific ongoing research projects include : predictive study on trends in the life-supporting environment in China over the next 20 to 50 years ; dynamic processes and prediction of trends in environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions of China ; research on global environmental change in Antarctica ; the field experiment in the Heihe river basin on the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface ; experiments on ocean circulation in the tropical western Pacific ; and studies on the formation , evolution and environmental changes of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau .  
Databases on contraceptive use ; fertility levels and trends ; mortality ; international migration ; world population ; demographic indicators ; sex and age in five year groups ; populations ; sex and age in single years ; age patterns of fertility ; urban and rural areas ; urban agglomerations ; global review and inventory of population policies ; and population , resources , environment and development ; ( iv ) Information materials and services .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
These conflicting perceptions and the underlying policy dilemmas could be reconciled better in the context of a more comprehensive and global policy dialogue designed to promote coherent policies in all countries for more balanced growth and development and to reduce unemployment in developed and developing countries . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
With an aim of preparing the ground for the emergence of an Afghanistan finding its rightful position with high credibility among the countries in the region and in the world , enjoying friendly relations on the basis of mutual respect and fruitful cooperation with the international family of nations , in particular its neighbours , and standing committed to joining the global struggle against terrorism and drug trafficking ,  
The immediate objectives of the Programme are : to enhance national capacities and strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for providing more and better jobs for women in the participating countries ; and to sharpen global concern for womens employment issues and promote a comprehensive and integrated approach to improving the quantity and quality of employment for women , based on the systematic accumulation and dissemination of information and experiences between countries and regions .  
Although the distributional impact of harmonized national carbon taxes may be uneven , it could be complemented by allocating the revenue to a trust fund to be used to finance projects for those countries which are overburdened with carbon taxes . 29 The rates should be chosen to meet the carbon emission abatement objective and should be periodically adjusted as more is learned about global warming .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
Noting that Canada faced new domestic and global socio-economic challenges , the representative emphasized that Canada had taken decisive steps to provide women with an effective legal framework against discrimination . 
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
The global plan of action , which sought to create the many new jobs required , especially in urban areas , specifically linked urban economic development to job creation and addressed the positive relationship between shelter and employment .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
The right to a healthy environment has been violated as a result of human activities which increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , with all the consequent effects on global warming , rising sea levels and climate in general .  
In view of the massive and systematic violations of which the third-world peoples have been victims in the recent past , such as slavery , colonization and cultural looting , it is obvious that there could only be a global remedy , the purpose of which is to re-establish these peoples in their communal rights by returning to them the goods of which they have been unlawfully dispossessed .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
Thailand 's space activities had developed in tandem with global space technology ; his delegation therefore appreciated the role played by COPUOS in strengthening international cooperation and norms for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , and fully supported the draft declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
It also firmly supported the work of the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) as the independent international authority responsible for the objective and balanced evaluation of the efforts of States to establish a global narcotics control policy and genuine international cooperation in that area .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :  
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .  
The global warming potentials used to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol listed in Annex B shall be those accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its third session .  
Its purpose is above all to alert the public and world leaders to the role of the oceans in planetary survival , to the threats facing the oceans and to more peaceful and sustainable use of the oceans , as well as to suggest ways of strengthening the legal and institutional framework for ocean governance at the national , regional and global levels .  
With respect to economic concerns , the Commission is looking at how far contemporary economic theory can be applied to ocean management in the context of sustainable development , at the national , regional and global levels and is assessing the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in improving the way humans treat the oceans .  
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
The programme activities of UNDCP are contained in seven programmes by geographic region plus one global programme : sub-Saharan Africa ; north Africa and the Middle East ; central and eastern Europe ; west and central Asia ; south Asia ; east Asia and the Pacific ; and Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
The activities of UNDCP in supply reduction and law enforcement should mean that by the end of the biennium 1998-1999 , closer working links will have been established with Interpol , WCO and Europol ; a global programme on law enforcement measures relating to precursor control will be operational ; a clearer understanding of effective methods of alternative development and monitoring of illicit crops will have been gained ; and high quality , timely analytical data relating to seizures of illicit drugs will be available to Member States and to other organizations .  
Research in policy development will enable Member States to respond to the global problem of ATS by means of improving the international drug-control system through the action plan against manufacture , trafficking and abuse of ATS for the special session of the General Assembly , and its operationalization and continuing scientific work to keep abreast of the perpetually changing ATS issue .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
They facilitate the spread of an economic model based on the principles of a market economy , while mass advertising and the global media help shape human aspirations and perceptions of social values .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
The effects of global warming are of grave concern to small islands like ours , whose coastal areas may become submerged , and whose protective coral reefs are at risk of total destruction .  
When my President addressed this Assembly on the impending dangers of global warming and sea level rise over a decade ago , the extent of the threat posed by climate change was not yet widely known or accepted .  
Unfortunately , an international consensus capable of marshalling the required political and economic resources into a coherent programme for economic development and improved governance at the global level has yet to emerge .  
When the Committee was formed over four decades ago , the major challenge that faced it was how to play a major role in one of the most fundamental global transformations in history a transformation that changed the complexion of the international community .  
Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
This is of the utmost importance in order to send a strong and timely signal to the international community that nuclear non-proliferation and efficient legal commitments thereto have to be seen as a crucial element of global security .  
We shall continue our determined action to promote a national and global order based on justice and equity in which all human rights are preserved , promoted and protected in the true spirit of the Universal Declaration . The President took the Chair . 
Assessments are required continuously , to guide rational and effective decision-making for environmental policy formulation , implementation and evaluation at local , national , regional and global levels .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
The main scientific objectives of the mission were the global study of the physical parameters of the planet Mars ( atmosphere , surface and interior ) so as to trace the complex history of its evolution since it was first formed .  
The development of cost-effective , meaningful and useful methods for the regular assessment , monitoring and review of the environmental performance of industry at the local , national , regional and global levels is urgently required .  
While the Covenant represents the most comprehensive single global legal instrument on economic , social and cultural rights , such rights are contained in many other international , regional or national instruments .  
Action at the global level and action at the regional , national and local levels should be consistent with each other and based on common norms .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
ERT ۲ K ( Turkey ) said that as the twentieth century was coming to an end , it had become evident that the international community was moving towards a new world order dominated by global rather than by national standards and institutions .  
We appeal to all parties at the global , regional and country levels to ensure that adequate financial resources are forthcoming so that the immense potential of volunteer contributions , now and into the next century , are fully realised .  
In adopting its agreed conclusions on the subject in 1995 , the Council took a major step forward by providing a coherent set of guidelines for developing a coordinated response to this global agenda at the intergovernmental as well as the inter-agency level .  
The Commission expressed its concern about the growth of transnational organized crime , which was affecting the political stability and social and cultural values of societies all over the world , threatening national and global security .  
The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring countries facing the Bay of Bengal and the quick notification of imported cases of this strain in developed countries raised global concern about a possible new pandemic of cholera .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
The most dramatic and economically successful application of space technology , the communication satellite , has been the greatest boon to national , regional and global economic and social development .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
In the next century , the planet Earth faces the potential hazard of rapid environmental changes , including global warming , rising mean sea level , deforestation , desertification and land degradation , ozone depletion , acid rain and a reduction in biodiversity .  
A new multimedia central editorial board will be established , with the objective of developing and maintaining a timely and more effective news gathering and delivery capacity , tied as much as possible to the global daily news cycle .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
In today \ x { e5b8 } global marketplace , where the supply is produced in one location to meet a demand elsewhere and in which profits from such illegal transactions can be hidden in numerous jurisdictions , enhanced international cooperation is key .  
In this area as in so many others effective international cooperation must be based on three key elements : the political will of States , a global approach to the problem , and the allocation of adequate resources to deal with its underlying causes .  
We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
Due to their size , most of these Territories are not endowed with natural resources and are subject to regular natural disasters , global warming , desalination of water sources , dependency on few commodities and a high level of emigration .  
ECA has developed extensive collaborative relationships with the various global entities , regional and subregional organizations involved in economic and social development in Africa .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , on a global scale the international community has moved forward slowly and has made only modest progress so far .  
For the medium term , his delegation supported calls for the development of a new international financial system based on increased accountability and global governance arrangements that were in keeping with the needs of the current globalized economy .  
Emission reduction targets for annex I countries should be based not on purely political compromise but on objective technical and scientific criteria relating historical emissions to their measured effect in terms of global warming .  
Concerned that global warming may be contributing to the worsening of weather , and concluding that further scientific investigation of the impacts of climate change and its relationship to extremes of weather is critical ,  
In coping with this multifaceted problem , my delegation considers that the United Nations should play a key role in coordinating various efforts at the national , regional , global and non-governmental levels in a timely and effective way .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
He expressed the Communitys concern at the growth of transnational organized crime whose many facets and increasing sophistication threatened not only national and global security but also political stability and social and cultural values the world over .  
The Rio Group noted with satisfaction that the approach to international cooperation had been balanced , realistic , innovative and global , and that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws and recourse to sanctions against States had been rejected .  
The Forum recognized the utility of designing a comprehensive Directory of forest-related international and regional organizations including information regarding relevant global and regional conventions .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
Internationally , we can not do without a minimum solidarity in this global village , which can not accommodate on a sustained basis a healthy and wealthy developed world on the one hand and a poor and unstable Africa on the other .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
These were responsible for the greater part of the landed catch of the worlds marine fisheries and were the main contributors to the global annual average of 28-million tons of discarded by-catch .  
But it was also necessary to cast a critical eye on the regulations applied in the global market , which was subject to far less rigorous supervision than that exercised by the national mechanisms of stable , developed economic systems .  
Since the crisis was a systemic problem , innovative measures at the national , regional and global levels were required to address the lack of surveillance , the regulation of short-term capital flows and the volatility of currency markets .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
In supporting those processes , whether at the country level through the resident coordinator system , or at the regional or global levels , UNFPA sought to be constructive in raising issues so that meaningful and sustained progress could be made .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .

The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .

Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .

The debates held during the high-level dialogue of the General Assembly on the theme of the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications had highlighted the concerns raised by globalization and the international consensus being forged on the need for a global response to the global challenges it posed . 
It was also important to find new ways of gauging international economic performance , not only by using formal economic indicators but also by measuring the informal and even the illegal economy in order to have a true measure of the global , or total , economy .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication .

Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Serving as the departmental focal point for developing and coordinating the implementation of global public information strategies and activities to promote special conferences , United Nations decades , international years and other major events relating to the major thematic areas ;  
Rapid advances in technology , growing awareness of the need to preserve Earth and its environment , the increasing potential offered by space activities for economic and social benefits vis - - vis the urgent needs of the developing countries and the changes in the global political scene during the post-cold-war era are sound reasons to deliberate on the role of space in the development of humanity in the twenty-first century .  
In view of the continuing need to protect humanity from the impact of natural disasters and of the fact that various national and international organizations and agencies have collected enormous amounts of data from space platforms and have successfully completed a number of related studies , it would be appropriate to initiate an integrated global effort as regards disaster management using space systems .  
In view of the immense potential of space systems to transform societies through distance education and developmental communications , in particular in the developing world , it would be worthwhile to initiate global efforts to create the required awareness among decision makers as well as to ensure effective and synergetic utilization of various space systems in that regard .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Furthermore , at a time when the economic and demographic situation is a global issue , it is important to strengthen international cooperation in this inevitable process of globalization and to exchange ideas and know-how , in the spirit of consensus-building , in order to reach the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life of present and future generations set by the ICPD .  
My country attached the utmost importance to the Cairo Conference , both in its own right and as a part of a global strategy for the promotion of sustainable development , which takes into account the recognized linkages between population , environmental protection and economic and social development .  
Requests the funds and programmes to submit to the Council through their executive boards information and analyses of the extent to which the cross-cutting themes and goals emerging from global conferences have been integrated into their programme priorities in a coherent manner , as well as on specific steps taken to develop complementary and collaborative approaches with other United Nations organizations in promoting the implementation of global targets ;  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
As a major topical event of the IDNDR closing process and the consolidation of global views , the conference identified those accomplishments and local experiences which can best improve organizational relationships and practical effectiveness for early warning into the twenty-first century .  
Being conscious of the international dimension of the illegal flow of armaments , Georgia stands ready to contribute to the multilateral efforts and to cooperate in negotiating effective instruments to this end , in particular , a global convention on illicit arms trafficking .  
It is also considered crucial that the next generation of operational observing systems be designed specifically to meet the more stringent requirements imposed by the need for the detection of climate and global change .  
The Working Group on Global Navigation Satellite Systems concluded that satellite navigation systems should be fully interoperable and transparent to the user and as a consequence recommended that the United States of America and the European Union ( EU ) develop a common definition of global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) for civil and public safety services .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
Conserving the environment , the advent of the information age and continued exploration of the solar system are just some of the important global issues in relation to which space technology can play a leading role in the coming years and many multilateral mechanisms already exist to promote greater international cooperation , in particular with a view to assisting developing countries .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
To implement an integrated , global system , especially through international cooperation , to manage natural disaster mitigation , relief and prevention efforts , especially of an international nature , through Earth observation , communications and other space-based services , making maximum use of existing capabilities and filling gaps in worldwide satellite coverage ;  
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
It is most unfortunate that as soon as the fear of a global crisis waned , people settled for cosmetic changes and repeated the stale old platitudes about how , in due time , freely fluctuating exchange rates would bring a stability of sorts to the system ; this , notwithstanding the fact that there has been almost three decades of constant volatility since that policy was adopted and a string of crises that have grown ever more intensive and destructive . 
Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
Widespread reliance on information-based technologies has resulted in an unprecedented degree of global connectivity and interdependence , with the result that many aspects of national and international activity , public and private sector alike , theoretically can be put at risk by criminal or terrorist misuse .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
The development of a competitive industry generating productive employment within a healthy environment was the best possible bulwark against poverty and the best means of creating an economically sound global society with minimal risks of economic and social conflict .  
In assisting the PA to develop institutional and managerial capacities essential to sound policy-making , UNCTADs assistance to the Palestinian people also helps to enable Palestine to emerge as a distinct actor in the regional and global economic arenas .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
This search is being guided by the expectation that demographic ageing holds the promise of maturing attitudes and capabilities in social , economic , cultural and spiritual undertakings , and for global peace and development in the next century .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
The recommended doctrine confirms India 's craving to be recognized as a global Power - not by acting as a responsible member of the international community but through nuclear and conventional militarization and aggressive actions .  
The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
Thus based on consensus , arrangements enabling improved coherence , complementarity and coordination in global policy-making can avoid unnecessary divisiveness and conflict while promoting fruitful forms of international economic cooperation .  
The cooperation between the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and OIC , through its subsidiary organs and its specialized and affiliated institutions , was closely continued in the social , humanitarian and technical fields and in their bilateral search for solutions to global problems in the region .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
Given IMOs global regulatory mandate , which encompasses the development of international rules and standards designed to enhance the safety of life at sea and protect the marine environment from pollution caused by ships , the twin fundamentals of sustainable development and poverty alleviation have evolved in recent years as parallel concerns to the Organization .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
UNDP / GEF seed resources will be matched by additional co-financing from the countries of the region and from bilateral and multilateral organizations directed towards the global FOCADES account or to specific thematic accounts .  
Some of them emphasize the increased mobility of factors of production , goods and services across borders and the resultant emergence of a truly global market , others see primarily the results and future potential of an explosive progress in information technology , while still others view globalization primarily from societal and cultural perspectives .  
Thus , if based on consensus , arrangements enabling improved coherence , complementarity and coordination in global policy-making can avoid unnecessary divisiveness and conflict , while promoting fruitful forms of international economic cooperation .  
The asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks arising from globalization warrants a global social contract between developing and developed countries , based on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility and with the active involvement of non-State stakeholders with a view to creating a rule-based international system where all countries could take full advantage of the process and where the stronger countries recognize and respect the constraints of the weaker ones .  
Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
For Latvia to succeed , and for the people of Latvia to have the full opportunity they deserve to live secure , healthy and prosperous lives , Latvia must be integrated into the political , business and intellectual exchange of the global community .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
A critical task was joint determination of critical milestones for conceptual designs , for delivery of content by the concerned substantive specialists , for coordination with the concerned technical services and for systematic feedback on design options from beta testers representative of the specialized constituencies for the global social development programme of the United Nations .  
The Gateway initiative began with a concern to provide an expanded range of information goods to the specialized constituencies of the global social development programme of the United Nations Secretariat in a timely and efficient manner and in fully accessible formats .  
We look forward to starting the preparation for the summit , which should adopt a balanced approach between political and economic issues , reflecting the global nature of European Union-Africa partnership in order to ensure concrete results . 
In this context , we would like to add that if the international community , just recently , was able to act in a concerted and comprehensive manner to resolve an issue which had received so much global attention , we firmly believe that if the same concerted and comprehensive approach were applied to Africa , it would surely resolve many of the major problems facing that continent .  
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
Through these multifaceted but integrated activities , UNCTAD should contribute to ensuring the overall coherence of the global economic system and to making it more conducive to fighting poverty , reducing inequality within and among nations , protecting the right of present and future generations to the preservation of the environment , integrating women on an equal basis , generating employment and integrating the marginalized fully into the global economy .  
Mindful of the potential opportunities and risks inherent in the globalization process , the States members of UNCTAD commit themselves to engage in a true partnership for development designed to promote a dynamic and equitable global economic environment .  
It concluded that , after nearly three decades of substantial change in global economic and social conditions in the cooperative movement and in the relations between it and Governments , there was need to change the tone and emphasis of the Recommendation to reassess the underlying concepts of aid to cooperatives and to include matters not addressed by it .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
e .  Marine environment assessments : global and regional assessments of the state of the marine environment ; global and regional assessments of marine mammals , including identification of endangered and threatened marine mammal species ; and rapid assessment methodology for coral reefs ( international coral reef initiative ) ;  
The United States of America , as a permanent member of the Security Council , had a special responsibility towards the Organization ; it was also the sole beneficiary of the 25-per-cent ceiling on contributions to the regular budget , with the result that its assessment level was considerably lower than its share of global gross national product ( GNP ) .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Thirdly , financial and exchange rate instability were closely related and in fact fueled one another , with the result that an integrated treatment of trade and finance was essential for designing consistent national and global policies .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
The Ministers at Marrakech had also agreed to transmit a message to the WTO Conference in Seattle , demonstrating the G-77s determination to ensure that future multilateral trade initiatives would be focused on achieving a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the global trading system , improving conditions of access for developing country products and services in world markets and correcting imbalances in rights and obligations .  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
His delegation stood behind the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and recognized the many pressing issues that bore upon the small island States progress towards sustainable development , including the public health and economic effects of global warming , the conservation of fish stocks and the strain that increased tourism placed on local infrastructure .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
With this objective in mind , ACC decided to undertake during 1999 a comprehensive assessment of the demands placed on the national and international systems by the new global environment that is emerging at the end of the twentieth century .  
Recalling further that these initiatives called for , inter alia , discussions on these themes on the basis of in-depth reports at the global , regional and national levels by intergovernmental , governmental , diplomatic , academic and civil society3 experts at conferences , seminars and other meetings as well as through the Internet , to be reported on to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fourth session ,  
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Australia and Canada , said that the central message of the Cairo Conference reinforced at the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly was that population issues were development issues and that the Cairo agenda should be considered as part of a global framework for sustained and sustainable development . 
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
Increasing globalization had posed a serious challenge to the attainment of the goal of full employment ; the global employment problem was further compounded by neo-liberal views which suggested that economic liberalization in its purest form was vital for growth and prosperity worldwide and which saw attempts to regulate labour markets and promote core labour standards as essentially distortionary and impeding the efficient functioning of markets . 
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Valuable contributions can be made to CLIVAR , the international research project derived from the study of the year-to-year variability of the tropical oceans and global atmosphere ( Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Project TOGA ) which led to the capacity to predict ENSO , by paying special attention to the measurement and understanding of ENSO characteristics in the eastern Pacific . 
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
In the context of the current global difficulties , it had become increasingly evident that economic , social and cultural rights must no longer be relegated to a secondary rank .  
The wave of economic and corporate restructurings undertaken to respond to an increasingly competitive global market and the widespread dismantling of social security systems have resulted in unemployment , work insecurity and worsening labour conditions giving rise to violations of core economic and social rights set forth in articles 6 to 9 of the Covenant .  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
The WTO-regime ( in the specific sense of a trade regime formulated and implemented under the organizational auspices of the WTO ) must be compared not to some idealized global economic democracy but to the most likely alternative a globalized economy shaped primarily by the bilateral efforts of the United States and other advanced industrial countries .  
Those who are satisfied with their global economic performance under existing rules are steadfastly opposed because they do not want to do anything that would jeopardize what they see as the crucial , and already difficult , basic mission of increasing trade openness .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
It considered the important developments taking place within the global economic system , the accelerated pace of liberalization in the multilateral trading system and the increasing emergence of regional and international economic blocs .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,

Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable and international financial system , with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
From the data gathered , the Panel calculated both an estimate of the total amount spent in the global emergency humanitarian relief effort for evacuees and an estimate of the total donations made to Jordan in cash or in kind and relevant costs that had been borne by other Governments and / or international organizations .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
As far as verification was concerned , the international community should support the UNDCP initiative on the establishment of an independent , neutral and objective global monitoring system to enable States to measure the extent of illicit cultivation on their territory and to take the appropriate measures .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
While the conceptualization of national and other more specific benchmarks has generated a great deal of discussion within the human rights community , the setting of progressive development benchmarks has been a natural outcome of the follow-up to international commitments made to implement the education goals of successive world conferences and global summits organized by the United Nations since 1990 . 
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing the negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
At a time of rapid and tumultuous global change , if UNDP can leverage this precious asset into a more effective role in helping countries to meet their development challenges , it will have a remarkable impact on human development and poverty eradication .  
Those were the key elements of an informed approach to global population and development priorities for the twenty-first century and should be addressed in the context of an enabling economic , social and cultural environment at the national and international levels .  
The orbital network of spacecraft operated by Russia was carrying out assignments in a range of basic areas , including implementation of international agreements , organization of manned orbital flights and operation of new industrial technology in space , conduct of basic scientific research , creation of global communications and television broadcasting throughout the territory of Russia , and also environmental monitoring and disaster management .  
Along with an explanation of the global framework and its regional organizational arrangement , the report will include concise methodological notes on how each regional comparison was aggregated and how the comparisons were brought together within a consistent and readily comparable framework .  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
By compiling and analysing the norms reflected in international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , a global framework of fundamental standards could be elaborated , protecting the individual at all times and in all circumstances .  
The variety and importance of the questions discussed at this session ending today and the earnest and constructive spirit in which they were considered show that , because of its representativeness , its universality , its capacity to listen and to see things from all angles , the United Nations continues to be the sole and central forum for pursuing global dialogue on the fundamental world problems facing mankind .  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
They include activities such as environmental planning , use of the geographical information system ( GIS ) , the global positioning system ( GPS ) and satellite images in environmental assessment and monitoring , demarcation of protected areas , guided firewood harvesting , promotion of energy-efficient cooking devices and practices , erosion control , tree planting , agroforestry , and environmental education and awareness raising .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
The proposed resources reflect a net growth of $ 701 , 400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
Thus we need to set aside the residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc security umbrellas with a new and innovative concept of global security networking , an inclusive and participatory system which uses the existing mechanisms in a complementary rather than competing scheme .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
We must give special attention to following up the results achieved at Geneva next June , with a particular eye to translating the agreements from the global perspective of the General Assembly to their regional and national dimensions , with a view to consolidating a political culture in favour of social progress , to use the phrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked the beginning of the social Summit .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
A strong and efficient United Nations will allow us to attain the main objective of this initiative : to determine agreed parameters for creating a stable and prosperous world without violence and without war , on the basis of the principles of inter-State relations contained in the Charter , and to find collective responses to the most complicated global challenges .  
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
There is a shared understanding that future global stability depends on the ability of the international community to increase the momentum for economic development and the capacity of national Governments to improve the delivery of essential social services , such as health and education , and to create employment opportunities .  
Norway fully supports the cooperation between the OIC and the United Nations in their common search for solutions to global problems related to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic , social and technical development .  
Paragraph 3 requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
The results of the discussions held in The Hague and St . Petersburg not only significantly advanced the themes of the first Peace Conference , but also helped energize a vital global debate on the role of the United Nations in preventing conflict and halting gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Slovakia recognizes as legitimate the efforts to secure an adequate position in an enlarged Security Council made by certain countries which are capable of assuming global responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
As one of the delegations that first introduced the issue at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in 1979 , we are firmly committed to the goal of achieving a Council that is more democratic , transparent , effective , accountable and relevant to current global realities.Six years have elapsed since the inception of the Open-ended Working Group , and we now stand at the threshold of a new millennium .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
The formation of a global information space , which is transforming information into a precious strategic resource , unquestionably opens up broad horizons for increasing the creative potential of mankind and presents favourable circumstances and conditions for the harmonious development of world civilization .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Taking place on the threshold of a new millennium , the Congress will serve as an unprecedented global forum to exchange and enhance innovative ideas from various relevant disciplines , demonstrate practical solutions and formulate common strategies to fight emerging crime issues , especially transnational crime .  
Over the last quarter-century , through an exhaustive and inclusive process of dialogue and discussion and through programmes of action and international cooperation , population has become part of the global dialogue on economic and social development.It has become part of every countrys political thinking and planning .  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
We set ourselves both quantitative and qualitative goals and accepted that their achievement would not only require the commitment and actions of individual nations , but would also pivot on a new global partnership among all the world ' s countries and peoples , based on a sense of shared but differentiated responsibility for each other and for our planetary home .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
The Commission urges relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
To be sure , global conventional energy resources are adequate to meet the projected growth in energy services for decades to come , provided that technology is developed to exploit and utilize these resources in an efficient manner ; the total energy resource base is expected to be expanded by the development and application of renewable sources .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
It reviewed the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of key interventions for adolescent health , highlighted the essential factors and strategies needed to establish , implement and sustain programmes for adolescent health , developed a common framework for country programming and recommended priority actions to accelerate and strengthen programming for adolescent health , including the global and regional support needed for country-level programming . 
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
BICEs representative at Vienna is a founding Board member and current Chairman of the Vienna NGO Committee on the Family established in 1985 , which aims to be an open platform of concerned NGOs for a positive , proactive and global promotion of the family as the basic unit of society .  
Modelling is most advanced in the field of global warming and climate change , and those models are gradually being developed and linked to other models to take account of demographic trends , land use changes , economic development projections and freshwater supplies , as well as atmospheric and oceanic factors .  
If current trends in energy and fossil fuel consumption continue , by 2010 global energy consumption and CO2 emissions will have risen by almost 50 per cent above 1993 levels . 11 There is general agreement that further increases in energy and material efficiency in production processes will need to be combined with shifts in consumption patterns towards goods and services that are inherently less energy and resource intensive if greenhouse gas emissions are to be stabilized . 
Nigeria accounts for 25 per cent of the global spread of AIDS in 1998 , with over half a-million new infections ; yet , efforts to educate the public about AIDS prevention and management are insufficient . 8 The health needs of special or particular groups such as pregnant women , the aged and the disabled , are also neglected . 
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
Recognizing that the current crisis has exposed weaknesses in the international financial system and the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms to create a strengthened international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of global financial integration ,  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
In this context , our country has firmly resolved to work with the whole of the international community and to contribute to the continuing improvement of the global and coordinated strategy defined by the Ottawa process for the complete elimination of the scourge of anti _ personnel mines .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Pending the outcome of the Statistical Commission at its thirtieth session in March 1999 , the Bank is continuing to move ahead to complete the final stages of the current phase of ICP at the global level and initiating activities for the next round .  
It includes purchase of one digital satellite ( hot standby ) terminal , one Optaphone digitally controlled rural telephone link system , four global positioning systems and the replacement of 30 base mobile transceivers .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
Scientific and technological breakthroughs , growing interdependence , impressive development of standards of behaviour at the international level , and the emergence of a global consensus to prevent war and curb the perils of armaments and , particularly , weapons of mass destruction are indeed significant achievements of the twentieth century .  
However , in spite of these historic accomplishments , the twentieth century will also be remembered for vivid images of unspeakable horror and bloodshed resulting from our failure to forge an inclusive global security system , in a world in which man , enabled by science , is capable of his own total destruction .  
With the uncertainties associated with the transitional nature of the global order , a tremendous obsession is evident to preserve military supremacy or assume a more prominent global role in the future order through acquisition of more advanced weapons of greater range , accuracy and lethality , something that might quite unravel the progress towards disarmament achieved earlier in this decade .  
General Assembly resolution 50-225 stated that the rapid pace and interdependence of global developments and their implications for all countries had led to a need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management .  
This objective will be pursued through coordination and outreach programmes for encouraging networking and coalition-building among non-governmental organizations , ensuring their substantive contribution to the Council and its subsidiary bodies and in the follow-up to global conferences to secure expert information and advice from non-governmental organizations and to provide training and capacity-building as required .  
An estimated amount of $ 152 , 000 , at the maintenance level , would be required for official travel of the staff of the Division to participate in global , regional , subregional and national conferences , meetings , seminars and symposia that call for coordination and the Divisions input for statistical development ; to assist Member States in institutional development in statistics ; and to ensure collaboration and liaison with the regional commissions on matters relating to statistical development .  
an improved dialogue on global economic and social policy issues in the Assembly and the Council , the identification of policy measures that should be adopted at the national and international levels to address such challenges and enhanced cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and other financial institutions ;  
Consultations and coordination with UNCTAD , the regional commissions , IMF and the World Bank ; provision of improved global on-line access to the Project Link model for other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  
On behalf of the United Nations , the Centre will lead its partners in a global campaign for secure tenure as one of the fundamental requirements for a process designed to lead to the progressive social integration of the urban poor and the realization of their right to housing .  
The senior officer is expected to prepare substantive documents for the preparatory process of the special session and coordinate the preparation of other related inputs and activities , such as organization of global and regional meetings . 
Secondly , as evidenced in the report above , TCDC - both as a modality and as an integral component of contemporary international development cooperation - is increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international community , as offering viable opportunities for improving socio-economic development of developing countries and for enabling their participation and integration in the global economy .  
During its first session , the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development recognized the crucial role played by small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in stimulating broad-based , equitable and sustainable development , as well as the role of the changing global economic environment and the pressures this puts on SMEs .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
To ensure that all users of space consider the possible consequences of their activities , whether ongoing or planned , before further irreversible actions take place affecting future utilization of near-Earth space or outer space , especially in areas such as astronomy , Earth observation and remote sensing , as well as global positioning and navigation systems , which have already become areas of concern because of the pollution of the electromagnetic spectrum ; Action should be taken :  
To welcome take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to implement consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
UNISPACE III had been the first global conference of the United Nations in which industry and civil society had participated as full partners of governments , reflecting the increasing economic use of outer space and the rapidly growing importance of private companies in that area as well as the heightened interest of citizens in matters relating to outer space .  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .  
It is important to recognize that the four principal functions and their supporting functions are fundamental to any future international arrangement and mechanism recommended by the Forum aimed at guiding forest policy actions at the national , regional and global levels .  
The dominant principal function under options 8 to 10 would be the formulation and application of a legally binding instrument on all types of forests , either attached to an existing instrument or as new instruments designed for specific negotiation and implementation at the regional or global levels .  
Formal technical presentations during the first of the three sessions focused on the role of remote sensing in achieving national food security , mapping from space , agricultural applications of small satellites , as well as recent trends in remote sensing and meteorological and global navigation satellite systems .  
Many global and regional financial institutions and national development funding agencies have established guidelines or other requirements governing procurement with funds provided by them , which is typically reflected in their standard loan agreements ( see also chap .  
The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
Moreover , the financial crises appeared to be increasingly frequent and more severe and it was beginning to be understood that they were the result of the malfunctioning of international capital markets and that global action was needed to overcome them . 
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
In particular , the strong State would have to be reinvented applying the decentralized model of organization of the modern global corporation , with the local states taking a proactive role in wealth creation across the territory and the national State acting as strategic leader , consensus-builder and broker between the supranational and subnational levels .  
The current meeting would be another milestone in the quest for sustainable development , which represented a basic precondition for peace and collective human security for global economic order .  
The mission of UNU , a nontraditional international educational institution , is to carry out scholarly work of the highest quality to help resolve pressing global problems of human survival , development and welfare .  
Environmental issues particularly the management of transboundary water resources , environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane to the political one , and have acquired truly global significance .  
The global market environment poses enormous challenges , and there is an urgent need for supportive international policies that will ensure the financial systems efficient functioning .  
Unless the developing nations are able to have a fair share in rising levels of global prosperity , the advocacy of democratic values and human and social standards will remain hollow .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
Each session of the General Assembly provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a unified approach and to coordinate our actions at the global level for the sake of a truly democratic , secure and sustainable development of humanity .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
Indeed , today more than ever , conflictprevention must become a global and integrated strategy to ensure in the long term not only the absence of armed conflict , but that conditions remain conducive to political , economic , social and cultural peace .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
In the broad spectrum of other challenges , such as global epidemics , regional conflicts , nationalist hatred , religious violence and terrorism , one of the very real dangers to human survival still emanates from the existence of weapons of mass destruction .  
We believe that there is an emerging consensus on the right framework to build a global order based on equal worth and social fairness We are committed to a new international social compact .  
The continuing transfer of capital , technology and managerial and entrepreneurial skills from the rich to the poorer countries has become the classic justification of global multinational activity .  
This global agenda is not restrictive , and can be achieved through the political , cultural , educational , social , economic , information and even technological domains .  
But it was the emerging political will , driven by newspaper headlines and by public opinion , that was the catalyst that gave decisive impetus to the search for a global response to organized crime on a global level .  
The plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful nations to accept rational and realistic changes in the Security Council is a key indicator of the future of global multilateral relations in general and of this Organization in particular .  
Secondly , some of the key elements of the United Nations Charter , which were presumed essential when the United Nations was established , have become totally irrelevant in the vastly changed present global political and economic context .  
There is a growing need to modernize the world by addressing global social and political changes on the basis of generally recognized moral , ethical and legal principles : democracy , human rights , equality , justice , freedom and humanism .

As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
The General Assembly is the global institution with the competence to look at ocean affairs in a coordinated manner , integrating all aspects of ocean uses : political , legal , economic , social , environmental and technical .  
Obstacles : Benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed , creating wider economic disparities , unsafe working environments and persistent gender inequality in the informal economy and rural sector .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle through extensive use of synthetic fertilizers , burning of fossil fuels and other activities also has the potential to change the structure and composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
Although there is a wide scientific debate and considerable media speculation about organized crime , there is little empirical research on the extent , structure , nature and strategies adopted by transnational organized criminal groups at the global level .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
The international community must develop highly credible and feasible systems to implement the mechanisms established under the Protocol , particularly the clean development mechanism , so that effective measures against global warming could be taken .  
It had also been recognized that the industrialized countries should take urgent measures , both corrective and preventive , to resolve pressing global environmental problems .  
These problems are global , but they require specific strategies , concrete goals and committed action at the international , regional , national , local and individual levels .  
The continued neglect of the urban waste problem will inevitably have dire consequence with regional and global implications in the not too distant future .  
The rehabilitation , or rejuvenation of politics and the polity , and a renewed emphasis on the need for humane , democratic and effective States that fulfil their role in complex societies more involved in the construction of a viable global community ;

Economic globalization and increased international competition force governments to reconsider other national economic policies , beyond specific changes in tax and social policies , in order to strengthen their relative position in the global economic system .  
Along with pressures emanating from increasing global integration economic , social , cultural there are strong internal pressures applied to Governments to provide quality services with fewer resources .  
Mobilizing the skills and other resources of diverse global actors , therefore , may increasingly involve forming loose and temporary global policy networks that cut across national , institutional and disciplinary lines .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
However , due to the complexity of missilerelated matters , no initiative has been taken at the global level , and the partial solutions presented thus far have been recognized and acknowledged as not feasible , practicable , or pragmatic .  
Participants also recognized the valuable work performed by the Centre in implementing the global programmes against corruption , trafficking in human beings and transnational organized crime at the regional and national levels .  
By the same token , the rest of the world can not ignore the unique contribution of small island developing States to global sustainability , through their rich biodiversity , their vast areas of marine resources and their coral reef systems .  
Small island developing States on their own are simply unable to shoulder the vast responsibility that falls upon them the guardianship of the essential global public goods , without increased support from the international community .  
Some have forged ahead and developed integrated , multisectoral approaches to sustainable development which necessitated the establishment of national focal points or coordinating bodies for the implementation of the outcomes of global conferences / summits .  
There is , however , a recognized lack of substantive global or national attention and research on the particular vulnerability of these children or the promotion of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The growth of transnational organized crime is affecting the political stability and social and cultural values of societies all over the world , threatening national and global security .

It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
But it was not just a question of free trade ; many developing countries were desperately in need of basic physical , educational , legal and even political infrastructure in order to participate in the global economy .

At the time of the initial sighting , the location of the submarine was verified by a fishermans global positioning system , and its position inside Republic of Korea territorial waters was later confirmed by military positionlocating equipment .  
It was essential that the Conference should be based on a global approach to development , that reflected not only basic economic aspects but also the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Unfortunately , the peacekeeping resources of the Organization are not limitless , and they must be apportioned in the best possible way , in a manner commensurate with the real danger posed by a given conflict to regional and global stability .  
Not once in this entire sevenyear debate on Security Council reform have we heard any major State declare that it deserves permanent membership because it is willing to give a solemn commitment to put global interests ahead of national interests .  
Expansion of the membership must be responsive to the changed global political and economic climate , reflecting the new realities in the global arena and respecting the principles of sovereign equality among all States and equitable geographical distribution .

In addition , a straight compilation of country data for 150 key variables from the customary international sources proved to be unusable because of inconsistencies , errors and incompatibility between global sets and nationally acknowledged data .  
This global initiative aims to expand and deepen understanding of human rights advocacy and develop womens capacities to be influential advocates in national , regional and international forums .

The Scientific Committees mandate included review of published scientific reports and technical documents with the aim of assessing regional and global levels of human exposure to radiation and its potential harmful effects .  
Given the global character that the problem of securing and distributing energy resources is assuming in the twenty-first century , as well as its own huge fuel potential , Turkmenistan has set about developing and implementing large-scale projects involving the laying of pipelines westward , southward and eastward .  
In this context , Turkmenistans initiative for the drafting and adoption of an international convention to guarantee the security and unimpeded transit of crude energy resources via major inter-State pipelines which are of enormous value to humankind and will carry the lifeblood for global economic development in the twenty-first century merits broad international support .  
UNIFEM believed that it was critical for women to take part in shaping the policies and practices that governed national , regional and global agreements in such areas as social responsibility of corporations , new trade agreements , reconstruction of societies emerging from war , or actions to respond to the scourge of HIV / AIDS .

Enhance the capacity of developing countries , particularly least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and countries with economies in transition , to analyse the challenges posed by the ongoing processes of liberalization and globalization and the increasing integration of those countries into the global economic system and to formulate appropriate national policies accordingly ;  
Objective : To foster a better understanding of the complex process of policy-making at the national level in a rapidly changing global economic environment .  
However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .  
Families should be supported and empowered to fulfil their multiple functions and responsibilities and to realize their rights , with policies and programmes based on a functional and global approach to the family as basic provider of social security and protection .  
It stressed the need to do so in particular so that inter-agency arrangements for internally displaced persons are predictable , characterized by accountability within the United Nations system , universal in their application and equipped to meet the immense humanitarian challenge presented by the global crisis of internal displacement .  
As indicated in last years report , although the major task of studying the global crisis of internal displacement and existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing it is largely complete , there nonetheless remain issues on which additional research and consideration are required .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
Underlying the immediate concern over oil prices were the global macroeconomic imbalances and systemic weaknesses exposed by the Asian crisis , and failure to resolve economic imbalances in an orderly manner would be most damaging to growth in developing countries .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
The Logistics Unit intends to carry out the Secretariats intention to develop and progressively deploy additional logistics support systems to create an integrated , online field mission logistics system , providing global visibility for United Nations-owned and contingent-owned equipment as well as United Nations-owned expendable supplies and ensuring the growth , quality and security of the systems in line with the expanding needs of administrative and logistic activities in the field .  
These efforts will be pursued in an integrated manner , supported by the three global programmes against transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings and corruption , and in close coordination with the global programme against money laundering of the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention .

The European Union participated actively in space activities and carried out a variety of scientific projects , including for the development of the automatic satellite navigation system " Galileo " and a global monitoring system for environmental protection and safety which would have practical applications in a broad range of fields , including the prevention of natural and man-made disasters and the mitigation of their effects .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
The recognition of special and differential treatments in favour of developing countries and an open , rule-based , transparent , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system are essential factors for a healthy global economic system .

The current achievements in spatial standards were presented , with emphasis on their goals to support understanding of the use of geographic information , increase availability access , integration and sharing of geographic information , and assist in the establishment of spatial data infrastructure at the local , regional , and global levels .  
The challenge for the cartographic / SDI community is not only knowing how to harness the enormous potential of geographic information / SDI technologies but also having the ability to restructure national mapping agencies and other governmental organizations to cooperate with one another and to create regional and global data infrastructure standards .  
Recalling that the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , conferred additional mandates on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and strengthened both its role as the global forum for international cooperation in combating the world drug problem and its functions as the governing body of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and as a treaty organ ,  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of the fourth preparatory committee meeting that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 , and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
The basic orientation of the programme involves three main types of activities : ( a ) the mobilization and coordination of international support ; ( b ) enhanced monitoring and assessment of activities ; and ( c ) advocacy and promotion of global awareness with respect to Africas critical economic and social situation .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was cited , which underscored that human activities are affecting the Earths climate , with potentially significant ecological and economic effects , and that it would be necessary to understand the interrelationships between transportation systems , technology and local and global atmospheric effects as the way forward is being planned . 
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
The major political commitment of States is to take enhanced international action against corruption , through existing instruments , a new binding global legal instrument against corruption and other measures .  
In view of the alarming increase in the illicit manufacture , trafficking and abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS , UNDCP was called upon to give higher priority to supporting Governments to counter the problem posed by those substances at the global level .  
Recalling that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , conferred additional mandates on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , and strengthened both its role as the global forum for international cooperation in combating the world drug problem and its functions as the governing body of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and as treaty organ ,  
She outlined a number of initiatives under way : at global management meetings , human resources issues were always on the agenda ; an Intranet site on staff morale had been established , which encouraged free and open dialogue ; the services of ombudspersons were being used to a greater extent ; and joint workshops for programme and operations staff were being held .  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
The leaders attach special importance to the subject of Arab economic integration and are establishing measures to promote this aspect of joint Arab action so as to achieve a link between shared interests and mutual benefits , as well as strengthen the economic capabilities of their States by adopting an Arab plan that will enable the achievement of full sustainable development and increase joint economic action through positive interaction with the realities of the global economy and the phenomenon of globalization .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional and sectoral levels .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Food Summit and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,

How to continue to benefit from the technical and logistical advantages of ad hoc groupings and limited representation forums , while ensuring that decisions with global repercussions are taken in forums that are more inclusive and that have clearly defined and broad-based intergovernmental mandates , such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the Development Committee and the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council ?  What would be the most appropriate form for an enhanced institutional relationship between WTO and the United Nations ?  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
Weaknesses in some national laws , regulations , licensing procedures and enforcement mechanisms are exacerbated by lack of capacity , insufficient political will , inconsistent approaches and inadequate coordination and cooperation at the national , bilateral , regional and global levels .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
The CCA document comprises : ( a ) an initial part , made up of diagnosis and analysis : the assessment as such ; ( b ) a second part which identifies the key issues , strategic themes and entry points of a global intervention framework to be defined at a later stage ; and ( c ) a third , methodological part geared to strategic and systemic discussion of the work of the expanded groups . 
At the international level , determining change over time and producing comparable regional and global assessments require extensive data assessment and analysis , drawing on detailed data source documentation and expert knowledge .  
As a global approach covering , in a coherent manner , the specific requirements of national , regional and international markets regarding quality standards , does not exist , companies are inclined to adopt the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 series of standards .  
The collective capacities of the system need to be harnessed to enrich and expand the knowledge base required nationally as well as internationally to broaden perspectives , act to address potential conflicts such as between trade rules and global , social and environmental goals , and maximize mutual reinforcement among policies and actions in different sectors in support of poverty eradication and development .  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
They considered that the closest inter-agency collaboration in integrating ICT into the United Nations systems operations and in helping developing countries bridge the digital divide was essential for the system to remain effective and relevant in a rapidly changing global environment .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
At the regional level , ECA and ESCAP , in collaboration with the UNAIDS secretariat , have held special events in support of the global initiative and in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly , with ECA having organized an African Development Forum at the highest political level focusing on Africas needs to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
Underscores the need to ensure an effective role of the Special Unit for TCDC as the substantive secretariat of the High-level Committee and as the United Nations system coordinator for TCDC as well as the focal point in the United Nations system for South-South cooperation and to this effect , requests the Administrator of UNDP to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit within UNDP is maintained , and decides to periodically review the impact and functioning of the Special Unit in supporting , promoting and coordinating TCDC cooperation on a global and system-wide basis ;  
Using available estimates , a minimum of $ 500-700-million of global funding , on which countries can draw swiftly in order to fill their budgetary gaps , must be generated , and an additional $ 500-800-million will be required to ensure continued accessibility by countries to essential interventions such as safe and efficacious combination drugs ( once current first-line treatments have outlived their usefulness ) or long-lasting insecticide-treated nets .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional , subregional and sectoral levels .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
The first-ever Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments , which was held at Headquarters from 30 August to 1 September 2000 , concluded with the adoption of the Declaration entitled The Parliamentary vision for international cooperation at the dawn of the third millennium , in which the Presiding Officers pledged their commitment to international cooperation with a strong United Nations at its core , and reaffirmed their belief that the United Nations should remain the cornerstone of effective global cooperation .  
Deeply concerned that the global HIV / AIDS epidemic , through its devastating scale and impact , constitutes a global emergency and one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity , as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights , which undermines social and economic development throughout the world and affects all levels of society national , community , family and individual ;  
In similar fashion , better efforts should be made to achieve improved relations between States , not only because this is mandated in the Charter , but also because it is viewed as essential to the global realization of human rights as indicated in article 28 of the Universal Declaration : quite clearly an international order that is generating terrorist acts hardly qualifies as a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in th [ e ] Declaration can be fully realized . 
The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
The special session of the General Assembly on children was expected to produce a global agenda with a set of goals and a plan of action devoted to ensuring three essential outcomes : the best start in life for all children , good-quality basic education for all children and opportunities for all children , especially adolescents ( who fall into the age cohort of youth ) , for meaningful participation in their communities .  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recognize that international and national exchange and dialogue [ among youth ] / [ at all levels , in particular educational institutions , religious authorities and youth associations ] , and the development of a global network among youth are important and fundamental elements in building intercultural understanding and respect and will contribute to the elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
Further , the Director-General was authorized to proceed with consultations on the establishment of a commission of eminent personalities with outstanding knowledge and experience of the social dimensions of globalization which will be charged with drawing up a major , authoritative report that makes a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the social dimensions of globalization , particularly the interaction between the global economy and the world of work .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
In the current stage of global development , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution for each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
The problems in Africa have only worsened , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and in mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and members of criminal organizations who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
Faced with the increasingly opaque web of local and global politics , economic interests and criminal activity that characterizes many of todays conflicts , we must make the best use of organizations limited resources by engaging all relevant actors in our work to improve the protection of civilians .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
Moreover , in the half-century that has elapsed since its establishment on the island of Taiwan , the Republic of China has seen significant political , economic and social development which renders it in practice an important member of the international community , as has been widely recognized at the global level .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
It could be rather useful to make the CST closer to the regional and national levels by organizing , in the period between the Conferences of the Parties , the regional meetings of the CST reflecting , in more complex basis , interlinkages with the activities of relevant subsidiary bodies ( scientific and technology ) of other global conventions and regional agreements .  
Appeals to the international community , United Nations bodies , international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources , including through the new global fund to fight HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit in 2001 and by the Secretary-General , for developing countries , particularly in Africa , with a view to enabling them to fully implement the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the Roll Back Malaria initiative ;  
It had endorsed the two major international human rights covenants , was currently drafting a basic law on the guarantee of human rights and had shared with many countries the benefits of its outstanding achievements in economic development , agriculture , global trade and information and communications technology .  
In its foreign policy , the Democratic Republic of the Congo understands that the use of force can not settle the problems confronting the world today and that in the struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a universal conscience and a universal union that can eliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very survival of the human race .  It is for this reason that my country has signed and ratified several global conventions dealing with the question of international terrorism .  
In designing the global legal framework against terrorism , the complexity and scope of the definition of terrorism should not and must not hinder the international communitys adoption of urgent , practical and effective measures to prevent and punish acts of terrorism and to establish appropriate punishment for their perpetrators .  
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
The commitment expressed by my country to the process of construction of the Euro-Mediterranean space , undertaken six years ago , is based strongly on its deep conviction that only joint and concerted action can consolidate stability and security in this region , and from that , to lay down , within the framework of a global approach , the basis of solidarity and cooperation based on the community of interests and a mutually advantageous partnership .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
Furthermore , the astronomical costs involved in developing a space-based defence system , taken together with those incurred to counter such a move , would inevitably result in heightened strategic competition and greater mutual vulnerability and further deepen the global economic crisis .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
Express our deep conviction that religious , moral and ethical values can play a major role in addressing the global as well as the local environmental challenges facing humanity ;  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
In the current conducive environment , such measures contravene all laws , principles and norms governing international relations in the field of global trade and directed towards the enhancement of extensive commercial and economic interactions among countries .  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
In view of the failure of the global community to harness the benefits of globalization , as evidenced by increasing poverty and marginalization , it was legitimate to ask whether the best interests of the global community were served in a world of short-term profit-taking subject to acute cyclical reverses , where the biggest segment of the market remained undeveloped .  
For the global fight against poverty to be sustained following those attacks , it was crucial to : boost and better target foreign aid ; complement strong reform efforts ; reduce trade barriers ; ensure that the WTO Ministerial Conference was motivated by the desire to use trade as a tool for poverty reduction and development ; and build social consensus for ongoing reforms . 
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
It had been encouraging to see the positive response of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society to forging a partnership with the United Nations system in order to advance the global efforts to bridge the digital divide .  69 .  His own Government had adopted a comprehensive approach to the promotion of science and technology .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
The Centre will advocate , promote , monitor and assess the progress made by combining best practices and enabling policies , and compiling legislation and plans of action for the identification of illustrative cities for the two global campaigns and further advancing the normative debate and operational action on major human settlements issues .  
The theme of the dialogue , entitled Responding to globalization : facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century , was considered to be particularly important and timely in the context of the current global economic slowdown , and emphasized the urgent need for poverty eradication strategies .  
This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
Still , the asymmetry of modern warfare , the existence of shadowy guerrillas with global reach , and the vulnerability of nuclear devices to theft or unauthorized use or simply to the chance that a madman might get his hands on them are today more than ever before eroding the logic and rationale behind the justifications for thousands of weapons designated for mutual assured destruction .  
Official and unofficial assistance to developing countries must be increased , their debt burden must be alleviated and the conditions governing their access to technology for peaceful uses and the access of their products to global markets must be eased to enable those countries to carry out appropriate reforms of their social and development institutions , diversify their sources of national income , create job opportunities for their nationals , provide education , health and social welfare services and combat chronic and epidemic diseases , especially HIV / AIDS .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
The budget proposals before the Committee reflected the best practices of the Organization in operating on a static budget for the past six years through prudent management of available resources , even in the face of increasing mandates and the debilitating effects of global economic conditions .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable development has put increasing focus on the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels .  
If the Agency were unable effectively to track the location and use of nuclear material worldwide , or to give adequate support to national nuclear safety measures , the consequences to the global community could be grave .  
The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .  
Success in the fight against transnational organized crime depended largely on the ability of States to achieve equitable growth , integrate themselves into the global economy in a manner consistent with their economic and social policy objectives and ensure that their populations benefited equitably from new opportunities for empowerment and technological advancement .  
International efforts in response to that threat , particularly those agreed on at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , reflected widespread awareness of the need to take global , integrated action to reduce drug abuse and eliminate illicit trafficking .  
The endeavour to reverse the marginalization of developing countries , to promote their sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to facilitate their integration into the world economy had led the international community to search for integral and balanced global arrangements .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .  
The report also stated that , according to preliminary estimates , the developing world would experience slower growth in its export volumes in 2001 , and that growth forecasts had been revised downwards even prior to the terrorist attacks ; the growth of volume of world trade was expected to drop to 4 per cent from 12 per cent in 2000 , and the global volume of imports and exports would have difficulty withstanding the declines in the prices of primary commodities and of manufactured exports .  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
An unrepresentative and anachronistic Council that does not reflect current global realities would find it extremely difficult , notwithstanding its worthy intentions , to effectively and credibly tackle this momentous challenge to international peace and security .  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
While heightened global concern about terrorism had raised critical issues which were being evaluated and about which decisions were being taken at the highest policy-making levels and official investigations were undertaken , an international coalition was formed with the declared objective of combating terrorism .  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Previous global forum events organized by UNIDO have highlighted the need to address the missing links in the current international development agenda and have emphasized , in broad terms , the complementary measures that need to be taken .  
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
Also encourages in such operations the sharing of geographical data , including remotely sensed images and geographic information system and global positioning system data among Governments , space agencies and relevant international humanitarian organizations , as appropriate , and notes in that context the work being done by the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters and the Global Disaster Information Network ;  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the Strategy , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the Strategy , in line with their respective skills and capacities , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen the coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] prepared in pursuance of its resolution 54 / 98 on the participation of volunteers , White Helmets , in activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief , rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development ;  
The nations of the world should continue to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , vigorously promote the Olympic spirit , seek peaceful solutions to international disputes and regional conflicts , enhance understanding and friendship among civilizations through dialogue and exchange , and work for continuous , global , social and economic development through cooperation .  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation on adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Recognize that gender equality has been fundamental in advancing efforts to achieve sustainable development and that the full participation of women in policy formulation and implementation should be strengthened at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
Recognizing the need to harness synergies and to create cooperation among the various Information and Communication Technologies initiatives , at the regional and global level , currently being undertaken or planned to promote and foster the potential of Information and Communication Technologies for development by other international organizations and civil society ,  
Welcoming the New Partnership for Africas Development , which embodies a common African vision of the future and a shared conviction of the pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place African countries , both individually and collectively , on a path of robust growth and sustainable development , thereby fully integrating Africa into the global economy and political system ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to launch a comprehensive and proactive public information campaign with sufficient financial resources to raise global awareness of the World Summit on Sustainable Development while also building broad international support for the World Summit and its goals ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences , and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
A significant response to this challenge has emerged from various global and regional programmes of environmental research , assessments and capacity-building mainly sponsored by the international organizations that make up the scientific and technological community , including the worlds scientific academies and professional bodies and independent networks of scholars , scientists and engineers .  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
A crucial role in the global governance of sustainable development that has found widespread acceptance since the 1992 Rio Conference has been played by the instrument of authoritative statements based on scientific assessments .  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation in respect of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
This growth in international information-sharing is linked to a large extent to increasing global awareness of the need for continuous monitoring of the environment , natural resources and changes stemming from human activity , as well as emergency management , together with the free use of previously restricted technologies .  
This has been achieved by making the relevant amendments to the Access to space action area by the appropriate means and mechanisms , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by Argentina in that connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
The agreed strategies and actions include developing a joint policy framework , improving data access and pricing , increasing effective research and development , evaluating and reforming education and skills formation strategies , and developing domestic and global markets .  
However , as statistical capacity develops the technical standards that one may apply to any indicator may be increased : definitions may be refined and the quality of the indicator at a global level improved .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment , as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The World Bank hoped that that report would contribute to the global debate at a time when it was imperative for individuals and communities to better manage their human , social , physical and natural resources in the long term and to rethink their basic assumptions about how to use the planets riches and plan economic development .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .  
He had called for a new solidarity based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility , in other words allowing for an adequate apportionment of the burden , bearing in mind the special responsibility of some countries which historically had accounted for a large portion of global resource use to ensure that the developing countries had the means for sustainable development .  
The expansion of global knowledge of and expertise to deal with crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money-laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems ;  
His approach to human rights is global and comprehensive , thus including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; he intends to pay serious attention to poverty as a fundamental human rights issue ;  
building partnerships , networks and consortia for actions among relevant stakeholders , including the private sector , at global , regional and national levels ; and facilitating the sharing of relevant experience of both developed and developing countries and lessons learned in : ICT for development programmes ;  
In urging the Governments concerned to adjust global production of opiate raw materials to a level corresponding to actual licit needs and to avoid unforeseen imbalances between licit supply of and demand for opiates caused by the exportation of products manufactured from seized and confiscated drugs ;  
Forest management is the stewardship and use of forests in a way , and at a rate , that maintains their biodiversity , productivity , regeneration capacity , vitality and potential to fulfil , now and in the future , relevant ecological , economic and social functions , at local , national and global levels , and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems ;  
The establishment of a new P-4 post for a human settlements officer in the regional office for Asia and the Pacific , in line with recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services to ensure the sustainability of the regional offices and enable them to play a pivotal role in the implementation of the Centres work programme ; there are increasing demands for the regional offices to execute normative tasks in addition to their technical cooperation functions , especially in connection with the Centres global activities in the areas of secure tenure , housing rights and urban governance ;  
Increased application of United Nations global agreements at the national and local levels , including those within the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda that promote sustainable human development in an urbanizing world , capacity-building and institutional development , as well as those included in Agenda 21 and under section 1.7 , Social and economic dimensions , of the Rio Declaration ; 
Continuing to promote and enhance effective measures , including fiscal and financial sector reforms for better domestic resource mobilization , and reallocating public resources for investment in social development , inter alia through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures ;
