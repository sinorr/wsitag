During his 12 years in power , Lee Teng-hui played political trickery to the utmost , excluded those not agreeing with him , was tyrannical and domineering , and , mechanically copying the Western parliamentary democracy model , directed several " constitutional amendments " and elections , prompting Taiwan to become a place " filled with a sense of confrontation and hatred " and distorting all mechanisms of a modern democratic society .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
Third , the Basic Law is the HKSAR 's constitutional law that stipulates the various systems and policies practiced in the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems ; the system for safeguarding the residents ' fundamental rights and freedom ; the executive , legislative and judicial systems ;

This official from the legislature said that apart from the unequivocal constitutional stipulations on a wide range of economic , social , and cultural rights that citizens are entitled to , China has also formulated a large number of relevant laws and regulations in recent years , further amplifying the legislation that protects these rights .  
Ichiro Ozawa , a radical politician and the current head of the opposition Liberal Party published his article in a magazine in 1999 , entitled " my proposal of constitutional amendment , " which said that the current constitution was forcefully formulated during the occupation of the US military , therefore , the constitution is invalid .  
" Hong Kong 's social , political and historical conditions are different to most , if not all .  That a degree of care and attention is required , particularly in relation to the unique situation embodied in One Country , Two Systems , and the specific intent and spirit of our constitutional imperatives , i.e . the requirements of the Basic Law . "  
" As part of the territory of China , we have been authorised to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication , in accordance with our principal constitutional document , the Basic Law . "  
The Government has considered the relevant issues and has no reason to believe that the case offends Hong Kong 's constitutional system or notions of substantial justice and would be likely to have a significant and adverse effect on Hong Kong 's trade with the overseas jurisdiction concerned or on Hong Kong 's financial system .  
We must make good use of these years to enhance public awareness of community affairs , to help them acquire experience in elections , and let them have a better understanding of the political system , thereby enabling them to participate in the discussion of the future constitutional development of the HKSAR in a mature and prudent manner .  
Article 113 stipulates that the Exchange Fund of the HKSAR shall be managed and controlled by the government of the HKSAR . It is unusual to have such detailed specifications in a constitutional law , but the transfer of sovereignty is a significant change and it is helpful to retain those effective features that contribute to Hong Kong 's success as an international financial centre in the form of constitutional law .  
The Basic Law is the constitutional law of the HKSAR . It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .  
These challenges , and the robust public debates on rule of law issues that have accompanied them , are a healthy sign .  It shows that the rule of law remains intact ; and that constitutional issues can be justly and efficiently dealt with by Hong Kong 's independent Judiciary .  
She said : " General legislative provisions can be , and indeed have to be , drafted in a precise and detailed way .  Even when frequent amendments to the provisions are required in order to accommodate the ever-changing social conditions , they will not create a profound impact on society .  However , the Basic Law is a piece of constitutional legislation which is fundamental to our society .  " Stability and foreseeability are paramount features of it , as they are of constitutions in other parts of the world .

Apart from constitutional amendment , a number of major trade-related laws came into effect last year .  These include the new Securities Law ( 6 ) , which relates to the listing and trading of securities , and the unified Contract Law ( 7 ) , that supersedes the respective laws governing foreign economic and other types of specific contracts .  
In November last year , a first group of anglophone counsel from my department attended an excellent English language course in Mainland law at Peking University . The course included lectures on the legal system and government structure in the Mainland , and on the latest developments in constitutional , criminal , civil and administrative law .  
" One Country , Two Systems " is an innovative concept , originated in China , designed by men of vision , courage and consummate wisdom .  It has made possible the peaceful resolution of problem left over from history concerning sovereignty , life style and constitutional institutions .  It has enabled two different systems , one capitalist and the other socialist , to co-exist within one country .  
During its stay in the United Kingdom , France and Germany , the delegation will meet with Ministers , senior civil servants , academics and experts in constitutional law , think-tank bodies as well as non-government organizations concerned .  They will exchange views with each other on how an effective system of executive accountability would work under a unique political structure .  
We are determined to maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and will continue to take forward our constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law . We will restore our fiscal balance to foster an environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
In respect of the constitutional developments after 2007 , a subject which is close to the heart of many people , I have also outlined a timeframe even though we have not yet set a detailed timetable .  We are pursuing in 2003 internal research .  We hope that in 2006 we would be in a position to take forward local legislation .  So the likelihood is that in 2004 or 2005 , we will be conducting public consultation .  
At the Legislative Council meeting today ( May 21 ) , the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs , Mr Stephen Lam , said that the Basic Law stipulated universal suffrage as the ultimate aim for constitutional development , and that the electoral methods should be specified in the light of our actual situation and the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  
Premier Sun informed the participants that in handling " this regrettable affair , " the government has been most concerned , and has carefully followed the rule of protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . The incident has in no way affected the central administration 's determination to implement democratic and constitutional government .  
This sums up events in the past century when millions of Chinese suffered under the experiments of various political systems , including constitutional monarchy , socialism and Communism . During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar . Specialists and scholars who had neither a hand in making up the bills nor were already opposed were asked to discuss these bills from a relatively fair , objective angle , in the hopes of raising public awareness and contributing toward a consensus .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
Interestingly , the staff that had been brought up on Lisa Kuan 's strict demands at first found it a bit difficult to adjust to Wang , who is relaxed , has a lively sense of humor , and is warm and genteel in her personal relations . Sunny Hsiao said it well with a metaphor from ROC history : " It was like going from the period of tutelary authoritarianism to that of constitutional democracy . "  
In his opening speech , he attempted to appeal to people 's emotions , recalling his background from a farming family . In addition , he was able to discuss individual topics pragmatically , presenting tangible arguments instead of theoretical discourse about broad principles . Lin spoke with intensity and assurance on the constitutional system , with which he is very familiar . However , restrained by his conditioning through years of bureaucratic experience , he appeared overcautious in the midst of exposition and argumentation .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
For instance , Chen Chih-hsiang , a judge in the criminal division of the Taipei District Court , has petitioned for three constitutional interpretations : one on whether third-time drug abuse offenders should be subject to mandatory life imprisonment or death ; another on whether the scope for compensation under the Regulations on Applications for the Restitution of Citizens ' Rights Violated Under Martial Law was too narrowly defined and the requirements for documentary evidence too rigorous ; and a third on whether mandatory life imprisonment or death for drug traffickers was unconstitutional .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
In 1996 , the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act in an attempt to regulate Internet content . The act made the creation , transmission or solicitation of materials lewd , obscene or harmful to minors via the Internet a crime punishable by up to two years imprisonment and / or a fine of up to US $ 25,000 . The bill faced continuous opposition from within legal circles throughout its approval process and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to sue on constitutional grounds .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
Fortunately , there are a few things we can be confident about : Though today 's constitutional environment is confused and rapidly changing , no one will be assassinated , the parliament will not be forced to dissolve , there will be no division of the national territory , and there will be no bloody wars .  
In Guangzhou , the ideal of constitutional politics was never realized . The government system there changed frequently and proved to be no more stable or capable than the northern regime .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency : its own demobilization . While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .  
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void . This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "  
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands ( Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu ) and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly . The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent . After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
Hualien 's chief prosecutor Yang Ta-chih inflamed passions by accusing the Ministry of the Interior of " violating the constitution . " Both the premier and the minister of the interior insisted that the checkpoints were perfectly legal . The ensuing constitutional debate and clash between the Minister of Justice , Chen Ding-nan , and the Chief Prosecutor are still making waves .  
wang , who is a deputy to the eighth national people 's congress , told xinhua the constitutional institutes have organized scholars , teachers and judicial workers to conduct study and academic exchange through various forms they have achieved valuable academic results and promoted development of chinese constitutional theory  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
Under the new Constitution , specific forms of administrative organization could be granted to some human settlements in the east and south of the country under precise juridical provisions adopted through constitutional laws .  
To this end Croatia has already proposed to the local Serbs and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , through the good offices of the international mediators , a comprehensive , elaborate and concrete peace plan in the form of a draft agreement on the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Srijem into the constitutional and economic system of the Republic of Croatia .  
In 1992 the Cuban Parliament approved a constitutional amendment which modified existing laws in respect of the Cuban State 's acknowledgement of property rights , the rights of joint ventures , and economic associations with foreign capital investments .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
The conflict broke out because , contrary to the provisions on the consensus of the three constituent peoples of the Constitution of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina , and with the support of foreign entities , attempts were made to impose the concept of unitary constitutional order under which the Serb people would become a national minority and be forced to live under Muslim domination . 
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Finally , my delegation welcomes the import of operative paragraph 10 of the current draft resolution , concerning the international community 's commitment to assisting and supporting the economic , social and constitutional development in Haiti in recognition of their importance for sustaining a secure and stable environment .  
To put those constitutional principles into effect , a vast national mechanism had been established , which had made it possible to predict and , to some degree , alleviate the negative consequences on women of the economic crisis , to include gender factors in State social policy and to take specific measures aimed at facilitating women 's adaptation to the market economy .  
He stressed that it would be desirable to take a more flexible position regarding reservations , since incorporation of the provisions of the statute into national law was bound to raise fundamental issues of constitutional law .  
In order to reverse this trend , the country must satisfy one major condition , a political condition : it must conduct free , transparent and democratic elections and take subsequent measures to establish a constitutional State .  
It was not possible to set up or put into operation the national state security council because those who were to be members had declined and the rebels came up against the unanimous condemnation and firm demands on the part of the political , moral , social and even military forces calling for a return to constitutional legality . 
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .  
A number of countries report that they have further reinforced the constitutional guarantees by enacting separate equality laws or amending civil , penal and family codes to ensure that women are accorded equal rights , protection , equal access and opportunities in education , employment , health and matrimonial and family matters under statutory laws .  
The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
Under constitutional systems based on the separation of judicial power , a central element in an offence could not be left to be conclusively determined by an international executive agency such as the Security Council .  
The most serious problems identified at that time were the lack of independence and autonomy of judicial action , the existence of obvious signs of corruption , the inefficiency of constitutional justice , the absence of proper professional training for the judiciary , the existence of obsolete laws , the lack of guarantees and recurrent violations of the rules of due process .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
Supports the need for an extensive study to be undertaken on the economic , social and constitutional conditions in each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , as called for by the Special Committee Regional Seminar held in Vanuatu in 1990 , which should be undertaken by the relevant regional institutions .  Statement made by the Minister of Housing and Settlements ,  
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
NULLThe Governments of Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Dominica , Mauritius , Morocco , the Russian Federation and Ukraine recognized the existence of national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minority groups on their respective territories , and mentioned the relevant constitutional and legislative provisions protecting them .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
Its closing consensus statement emphasized that media scrutiny of the exercise of political power was essential in a democratic society ; that all media laws should conform to international and constitutional standards ; and that journalists themselves have a duty to work to the highest professional standards .  
Accordingly , it was necessary to elaborate new international approaches conducive to fair and flexible solutions in order to prevent new conflicts , in strict accordance with constitutional procedures and the internal legislation of the State concerned .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
a result of the constitutional changes in the Sudan , which had granted total autonomy to the existing 26 federal states , the status of the refugees could be affected if the international community did not adopt urgent measures to provide more support to the States in which the majority of the refugees were concentrated , especially since in many cases they had overloaded the country 's already limited economic capacity .  
has been emphasized in Security Council resolution 1023 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the transitional administration is to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the region into the Croatian legal and constitutional system following four years of war and hostility , which have created deep apprehension , fear and distrust between the Croatian Government and the local Serbs .  
Efforts to perfect Cuba 's political system and the rule of law had included the strengthening of constitutional rights and the enactment of a new election law providing for free , direct and secret parliamentary elections for the direct , popular nomination of candidates , without any need for political affiliation or party membership .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The recent kidnapping incident appeared to put the peace process into question , but the Government as well as the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) clearly opted for peace , and we are pleased to note that partial agreements on pending issues such as the ceasefire , constitutional reform and the reintegration of URNG guerrillas into the political life of Guatemala will be signed in Oslo , Stockholm and Madrid respectively during the first half of December . We urge the parties to do their utmost to adhere to this programme . 
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .  
In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
On the question of fundamental discrepancies between the constitutional and de facto rights of women , including economic and employment constraints , inadequate social services , inappropriate policies and outmoded stereotypes , she said that article 22 of the Ukrainian Labour Code prohibited gender-based violations of a woman 's right to be hired for work .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
Additionally , we note that at this time the National Police Force is not adequately trained or fully operational , which is a vital aspect for moving Haiti away from its turbulent past and pointing it in the direction of political stability , lasting democracy , constitutional order , economic prosperity and national reconciliation .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
This trust fund was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 940 ( 1994 ) to assist the legitimate constitutional authorities of Haiti in establishing an environment conducive to the organization of free and fair legislative elections to be called by those authorities and , when requested by them , monitored by the United Nations , in cooperation with the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .  
The Authority is doing this based on overwhelming popular support , which was crystallized in the historic election process conducted by the Palestinian people in January of this year , during which our people voiced their political choices clearly in favour of the peace process and gave a vote of confidence and constitutional legitimacy to the Palestinian leadership .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
The system is based on the criterion of rationalizing the use of State penal power by offering such options as : ( a ) punishing crime that has a high social cost and reducing the severity of punishment for less serious crimes ; ( b ) avoiding discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors , such as women and indigenous people ; ( c ) scrupulously respecting constitutional guarantees such as the principles of legality and guilt ; and ( d ) guaranteeing the rational and egalitarian implementation of the law .  
Papua New Guinea therefore urged those States that were members of the Committee and other States , including the administering Powers , to acknowledge the importance and usefulness of regional seminars as one of the most effective ways of assessing the political , constitutional , economic and social development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories . The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m . 
Welcoming also the continued efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti , Supporting fully the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in the establishment of a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti , and encouraging the International Civilian Mission to continue to cooperate with the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and others participating in institution-building , including police training activities ,  
The international community rose in unison in condemning unequivocally the military takeover and in demanding the prompt and unconditional return of Burundi to its constitutional Government , including the restoration of its elected National Assembly .  
The military coup d'etat of 25 July last in Burundi was a violent act that flew in the face of established constitutional order , accelerated the spiral of violence and arbitrarily usurped political power to the detriment of democracy , national reconciliation and peace in that country .

With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar . Specialists and scholars who had neither a hand in making up the bills nor were already opposed were asked to discuss these bills from a relatively fair , objective angle , in the hopes of raising public awareness and contributing toward a consensus .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
Interestingly , the staff that had been brought up on Lisa Kuan 's strict demands at first found it a bit difficult to adjust to Wang , who is relaxed , has a lively sense of humor , and is warm and genteel in her personal relations . Sunny Hsiao said it well with a metaphor from ROC history : " It was like going from the period of tutelary authoritarianism to that of constitutional democracy . "  
In his opening speech , he attempted to appeal to people 's emotions , recalling his background from a farming family . In addition , he was able to discuss individual topics pragmatically , presenting tangible arguments instead of theoretical discourse about broad principles . Lin spoke with intensity and assurance on the constitutional system , with which he is very familiar . However , restrained by his conditioning through years of bureaucratic experience , he appeared overcautious in the midst of exposition and argumentation .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
For instance , Chen Chih-hsiang , a judge in the criminal division of the Taipei District Court , has petitioned for three constitutional interpretations : one on whether third-time drug abuse offenders should be subject to mandatory life imprisonment or death ; another on whether the scope for compensation under the Regulations on Applications for the Restitution of Citizens ' Rights Violated Under Martial Law was too narrowly defined and the requirements for documentary evidence too rigorous ; and a third on whether mandatory life imprisonment or death for drug traffickers was unconstitutional .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
In 1996 , the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act in an attempt to regulate Internet content . The act made the creation , transmission or solicitation of materials lewd , obscene or harmful to minors via the Internet a crime punishable by up to two years imprisonment and / or a fine of up to US $ 25,000 . The bill faced continuous opposition from within legal circles throughout its approval process and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to sue on constitutional grounds .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
Fortunately , there are a few things we can be confident about : Though today 's constitutional environment is confused and rapidly changing , no one will be assassinated , the parliament will not be forced to dissolve , there will be no division of the national territory , and there will be no bloody wars .  
In Guangzhou , the ideal of constitutional politics was never realized . The government system there changed frequently and proved to be no more stable or capable than the northern regime .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency : its own demobilization . While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .  
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void . This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "  
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands ( Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu ) and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly . The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent . After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
Hualien 's chief prosecutor Yang Ta-chih inflamed passions by accusing the Ministry of the Interior of " violating the constitution . " Both the premier and the minister of the interior insisted that the checkpoints were perfectly legal . The ensuing constitutional debate and clash between the Minister of Justice , Chen Ding-nan , and the Chief Prosecutor are still making waves .  
wang , who is a deputy to the eighth national people 's congress , told xinhua the constitutional institutes have organized scholars , teachers and judicial workers to conduct study and academic exchange through various forms they have achieved valuable academic results and promoted development of chinese constitutional theory  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
Under the new Constitution , specific forms of administrative organization could be granted to some human settlements in the east and south of the country under precise juridical provisions adopted through constitutional laws .  
To this end Croatia has already proposed to the local Serbs and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , through the good offices of the international mediators , a comprehensive , elaborate and concrete peace plan in the form of a draft agreement on the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Srijem into the constitutional and economic system of the Republic of Croatia .  
In 1992 the Cuban Parliament approved a constitutional amendment which modified existing laws in respect of the Cuban State 's acknowledgement of property rights , the rights of joint ventures , and economic associations with foreign capital investments .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
The conflict broke out because , contrary to the provisions on the consensus of the three constituent peoples of the Constitution of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina , and with the support of foreign entities , attempts were made to impose the concept of unitary constitutional order under which the Serb people would become a national minority and be forced to live under Muslim domination . 
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Finally , my delegation welcomes the import of operative paragraph 10 of the current draft resolution , concerning the international community 's commitment to assisting and supporting the economic , social and constitutional development in Haiti in recognition of their importance for sustaining a secure and stable environment .  
To put those constitutional principles into effect , a vast national mechanism had been established , which had made it possible to predict and , to some degree , alleviate the negative consequences on women of the economic crisis , to include gender factors in State social policy and to take specific measures aimed at facilitating women 's adaptation to the market economy .  
He stressed that it would be desirable to take a more flexible position regarding reservations , since incorporation of the provisions of the statute into national law was bound to raise fundamental issues of constitutional law .  
In order to reverse this trend , the country must satisfy one major condition , a political condition : it must conduct free , transparent and democratic elections and take subsequent measures to establish a constitutional State .  
It was not possible to set up or put into operation the national state security council because those who were to be members had declined and the rebels came up against the unanimous condemnation and firm demands on the part of the political , moral , social and even military forces calling for a return to constitutional legality . 
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .  
A number of countries report that they have further reinforced the constitutional guarantees by enacting separate equality laws or amending civil , penal and family codes to ensure that women are accorded equal rights , protection , equal access and opportunities in education , employment , health and matrimonial and family matters under statutory laws .  
The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
Under constitutional systems based on the separation of judicial power , a central element in an offence could not be left to be conclusively determined by an international executive agency such as the Security Council .  
The most serious problems identified at that time were the lack of independence and autonomy of judicial action , the existence of obvious signs of corruption , the inefficiency of constitutional justice , the absence of proper professional training for the judiciary , the existence of obsolete laws , the lack of guarantees and recurrent violations of the rules of due process .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
Supports the need for an extensive study to be undertaken on the economic , social and constitutional conditions in each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , as called for by the Special Committee Regional Seminar held in Vanuatu in 1990 , which should be undertaken by the relevant regional institutions .  Statement made by the Minister of Housing and Settlements ,  
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .

It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .

a result of the constitutional changes in the Sudan , which had granted total autonomy to the existing 26 federal states , the status of the refugees could be affected if the international community did not adopt urgent measures to provide more support to the States in which the majority of the refugees were concentrated , especially since in many cases they had overloaded the country 's already limited economic capacity .  
has been emphasized in Security Council resolution 1023 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the transitional administration is to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the region into the Croatian legal and constitutional system following four years of war and hostility , which have created deep apprehension , fear and distrust between the Croatian Government and the local Serbs .  
Efforts to perfect Cuba 's political system and the rule of law had included the strengthening of constitutional rights and the enactment of a new election law providing for free , direct and secret parliamentary elections for the direct , popular nomination of candidates , without any need for political affiliation or party membership .

I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The recent kidnapping incident appeared to put the peace process into question , but the Government as well as the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) clearly opted for peace , and we are pleased to note that partial agreements on pending issues such as the ceasefire , constitutional reform and the reintegration of URNG guerrillas into the political life of Guatemala will be signed in Oslo , Stockholm and Madrid respectively during the first half of December . We urge the parties to do their utmost to adhere to this programme . 
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .

The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level .

The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
This trust fund was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 940 ( 1994 ) to assist the legitimate constitutional authorities of Haiti in establishing an environment conducive to the organization of free and fair legislative elections to be called by those authorities and , when requested by them , monitored by the United Nations , in cooperation with the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .  
The Authority is doing this based on overwhelming popular support , which was crystallized in the historic election process conducted by the Palestinian people in January of this year , during which our people voiced their political choices clearly in favour of the peace process and gave a vote of confidence and constitutional legitimacy to the Palestinian leadership .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
The system is based on the criterion of rationalizing the use of State penal power by offering such options as : ( a ) punishing crime that has a high social cost and reducing the severity of punishment for less serious crimes ; ( b ) avoiding discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors , such as women and indigenous people ; ( c ) scrupulously respecting constitutional guarantees such as the principles of legality and guilt ; and ( d ) guaranteeing the rational and egalitarian implementation of the law .

These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations .

While some support was expressed for modifying the article as suggested , one view was that the article should be deleted because it either stated what applied anyway or because it was not for a ( model ) national statute to deal with matters that concerned the hierarchy among legislative acts , an issue that had constitutional implications .  
Women are rarely appointed to these senior or influential positions and while their numbers may in some States be increasing at the lower levels and in posts usually associated with the home or the family , they form only a tiny minority in decision-making positions concerned with economic policy or development , political affairs , defence , peacemaking missions , conflict resolution or constitutional interpretation and determination .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .
