" All industrial nations should implement sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that are necessary to sustain robust domestic demands and hence , create multiple engines to promote economic growth , " he said . 
Amidst structural adjustments this year , Hainan special zone 's economy has realized steady and healthy development and is estimated to have an annual rate of economic increase reaching 6.7% , increasing by 1.9% over last year .  
Our reporter has learned from relevant sources within the China State Planning Commission that development of China 's high-tech industry will proceed in conformity with promoting economic and social development and stimulating structural adjustments and upgrading .  Currently , three main responsibilities have been identified :  
As S &amp; T have developed briskly throughout the world and economic structural adjustment has accelerated , and impacted by the Asian financial crisis , a certain international deflationary state has appeared .  This has also had a definite impact on China 's overall prices .  
Hard supply refers to the low-level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form .  Since our market lacks elimination-through-competition forces , with enterprises lacking innovative skills , this hard supply is not corrected promptly and effectively .  
For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
It is necessary to properly handle the direction and intensity of macro regulation and control , combine internal demand expansion , structural readjustment , scientific and technological progress , and opening up to the outside work , accelerate the fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic growth modes , and strive to uplift the development of the national economy to a new stage .  
The practical industrial structural adjustment has laid a sound industrial foundation for Hainan , enabling the province 's economy to develop rapidly and the economic results to improve ; as a result , the quality of its economic growth has improved notably .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
Having gone through the change from " getting rich overnight " to " working in the light of the reality , " many Hainan deputies said with deep reflection : Industrial structural adjustment must be carried out in the light of local conditions and we must be pragmatic .  Only by doing so can we achieve practical results and ensure sustainable economic and social development .  
Key topics discussed by the deputies in their speeches were active efforts to seize the great opportunities presented to Sichuan by the development of the western region , exploitation of resources , ecological protection , economic structural adjustment , better incomes for the peasants , and vigorous efforts to develop scientific educational undertakings .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that positively pushing forward the strategic economic structural adjustment is a fundamental measure to give impetus to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and elevate the quality and efficiency of the economic growth .  This is both a long-term mission and a pressing economic task of the moment .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
In light of the situation in Yunnan , indeed , only by maintaining relatively rapid economic growth under the precondition of enhancing effectiveness can the enterprises ' difficulty in production and operation be mitigated , the pressure of employment be lessened , and the structural adjustment and in-depth reformed be promoted , so that financial revenue can be increased , financial risks be prevented , and social stability be maintained .  
A new round of structural adjustment is being carried out throughout the world ; new - and high-technology industry and newly emerging industry are developing robust ; intellectual economy has raged like a storm , and world economic competition has become increasingly intense .  
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
As a result of economic and trade cooperation with the mainland , the proportions of primary and secondary industries in the island 's total output value have kept declining , while that of tertiary industry has gradually risen , thereby effectively promoting Taiwan 's economic transformation and industrial structural adjustment .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
We should put the improvement of quality and enhancement of economic result high on the agenda .  Guided by the market , we should make active efforts to push forward the structural adjustment , do a good job in controlling total supply and total demand , resolutely eliminate enterprises with inferior production capability , and avoid making the same mistake of duplicating construction projects .  We should integrate the periodical goal with the long-term goal of carrying out the reform and development of state-owned enterprises .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
The socialist market economic structure is the designated model for the economic structural reform in China , it marks the forsaking of the highly centralized conventional planned economic structure of the past , and it is substantially different from the capitalist market economy .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
Therefore , we should understand the vital significance of structural adjustment from the strategic point of view , speed up the economic structural adjustment and upgrading , and cultivate and bring up the industries and products with strong competitive power .  Only in this way can we remain invincible in the increasingly vehement international competition in the 21st century .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
To establish the structural design of nuclear weapons devices , Guo Yonghuai proposed " proceeding along two parallel roads and choosing the superior one in the end " in order to determine the optimum plan for the first nuclear bomb detonation , which played a decisive role in deciding several critical questions .  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Speeding up the establishment of a social security system is now the key issue in deepening enterprise reform and speeding up structural adjustment ; it has a bearing on efforts by enterprises to separate out their social functions and cut personnel to improve efficiency , on whether the reassignment of laid-off personnel to other jobs can move forward or not , and on whether the task of upgrading the industrial structure and improving enterprise efficiency can be accomplished smoothly .  It has become a critical task .  
While making conscientious efforts to run existing social security services well , we will speed up the formation of a social security system that is independent of enterprises and institutions , has diverse sources of funding and a standardized system of support services , and is run and managed by society , in order to guarantee the smooth progress of state-owned enterprise reform and structural adjustment and maintain the basic stability of society .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
The main role of the government is to create a favorable macroeconomic environment for structural readjustment by improving macroeconomic regulation and control , pressing ahead with reform , restoring market order through economic policy , providing public services , and concentrating its energies on major projects .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
Given that the degree of marketization is increasing all the time , and agricultural development is shifting from being mainly constrained by resources to being doubly constrained by resources and demand , structural contradictions are extremely conspicuous , relative surpluses of a phased and structural nature have emerged in agricultural products , sales are sluggish , prices have fallen , and the comparative returns on agriculture have declined year by year .  
" Primary Industry " Will Fall While " Tertiary Industry " Will RiseThe Outline proposes that the principal anticipated targets for China 's economic structural adjustment be as follows : By 2005 , the proportions of added value of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries held in the GDP will be 13 percent , 51 percent , and 36 percent respectively , and the proportions of employees in these industries held in the total employees of entire society will be 44 percent , 23 percent , and 33 percent respectively . 
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
Despite widespread concern that a US economic slowdown will affect China 's foreign capital intake , a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation expressed optimism : This year China will maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also will cause a significant structural improvement .  
Ma Xiuhong pointed out that China 's foreign capital intake proved to continue the dramatic upward trend in the first quarter of the year .  She believed that this year China would maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also would cause a marked structural improvement .  
To actively provide effective services for readjusting the rural economic structure and increasing peasants ' income , the vast number of rural grassroots cadres should study in depth the conspicuous contradictions in local agriculture and the rural economic structure , get their ideas into shape , draw up and perfect plans for structural readjustment and economic development in the light of local conditions , and go from village to village , household to household to properly determine measures for readjusting the economic structure and increasing income .  
Experts taking part in the survey said that in the course of the work , they chose a total of 10 topics of common concern , which included economic growth , increase in income , structural reform , punishing corruption , and urban employment , to test the satisfaction of residents with social life .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
Relocation of enterprises in the project area should be closely linked to adjustment of the economic structure and structural adjustment of enterprises , and no construction of low-standard redundant projects is allowed .  Enterprises that ought to be shut down should be decidedly shut down , and those ought to go bankrupt should declare bankrupt according to the legal procedures .  Staff members and workers of enterprises shut down and declared bankrupt should be properly taken care of and basic needs for their daily life should be ensured .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
In an editorial on 7 June , the China Times pointed out structural factors behind the island 's current economic malaise .  If the root cause of the problems is not dealt with and if overhasty actions are adopted , the paper stated , economic problems would only be made even more complicated and intractable .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The Chinese government will continue to make development the main theme , make structural adjustment the main line , make reform and opening up and technical progress the motivation , make raising the people 's living standards the fundamental objective , and industriously take steps forward for economic development and social advance .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
We should study the new phenomenon that corruption breeds and becomes rampant during the period of economic structural change and rapid economic growth .  We should further define our thinking and policy , based on the analysis and study , for the case handling work under the new circumstances .  Only in this way can we firmly keep the initiative in our hands during the anti-corruption struggle and punish corruption in a more forceful and effective way .  
Wen Jiabao stressed : We must seize the opportune time before us to vigorously advance the cotton circulation structural reform and be sure to make a breakthrough so as to lay a sound foundation for promoting healthy development of the country 's cotton production and enhancing the international competitiveness of our cotton textiles .  
This is the fundamental orientation and long-term goal of this round of cotton circulation structural reform as well as an effective way of increasing the cotton industry 's economic returns and cotton farmers ' income and raising the level of modernization of cotton production and processing .  
Wen Jiabao stressed : The 2001 cotton year is coming soon .  Making a good job of cotton purchase and marketing in the new year will be of extremely great significance to deepening the cotton circulation structural reform , stabilizing cotton production , protecting the farmers ' interests , and promoting sustained , healthy development of the textile industry .  
We have laid down a plan for national economic and social development for the coming five years .  We will persistently take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal and continue to push forward reform , opening up , and the modernization drive .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .  Under such circumstances , financial loopholes , violations of the financial law and discipline , and government corruption are inevitable .  
The 10th Five-Year Plan period will prove a crucial transitional period after China joins the WTO . Basing on the relative advantages and disadvantages of China 's major industries in international competitions , the " Special Plan for the WTO Accession " has clearly put forward the orientation , priorities , and key measures for the structural readjustment and the reform of these industries .  
The speech expounded in an all-round way the important guiding principles put forward by the fifth plenary session on comprehensively pushing forward economic development and social progress by making development the theme ; structural adjustment the main line ; reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force ;  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
In view of this , we should select a number of key areas , such as equipment manufacturing , the deep-processing of farm products , clean coal , and the comprehensive utilization of resources ; speed up the development of common technologies , key technologies , and supporting technologies that can give an impetus to structural upgrading ; and accelerate the technical upgrading of traditional industries .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .  
According to initial revelations , continuing to increase domestic demand , carrying out structural adjustments , pressing ahead with the great development of the western region , deepening reform of state-owned enterprises , stepping up efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and improving the social welfare and insurance systems , will be the vital parts of the report .  
Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
As the economy has been consistently mired in recessionary crises since the start of the transition , structural adjustment has been implemented not through manipulating differences in growth rate of different economic sectors , but through manipulating differences in the rate of decline of the sectors , resulting in the prominent negative and passive characters of the structural adjustment .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .  
To change the abnormal state of structural changes in the previous period , the Putin government has emphasized that its is necessary to shake off the lasting crisis as soon as possible and to stimulate rapid economic growth first and , then , to carry out sound economic structural adjustments on the basis of rapid economic growth .  
Enterprise structural adjustment means acting in lines affecting the pulse of the national economy with particularly marked efficiency of scale to amass effective resources through the market , forming production and operations of scale , to turn them into pillars in key lines and fields of the national economy , leaders in economic structural adjustment , representative participants in international competition , and the key forces for state regulation and control of the economy . 
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .

At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Enterprise closure and bankruptcy should center around key industries such as the iron and steel , coal , refined sugar , nonferrous metals , textile , and war industries that are undergoing structural readjustments .  For specific projects already approved , we should deal with each as it matures , work on one project at a time , and stabilize one project at a time .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
The meeting maintained that in light of the bumper harvests of grain for many years in a row and the phased situation of supply exceeding demand , the party 's central committee and the State Council have formulated a series of powerful policies and measures , particularly the one to promote grain circulation structural reform with stress on the " three policies and one reform , " and attained remarkable results .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central authorities , various localities and departments concerned have accelerated the structural adjustment of agriculture and grain production , persisted in procuring peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices without restriction , increased the intensity of selling grain at favorable prices , tightened the management of grain purchasing funds and grain markets , and pushed forward the reform of grain procuring and marketing enterprises .  
Practice has fully proven that the central policies on grain reform are entirely correct and have played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for grain production , giving impetus to agricultural structural adjustment , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
Through structural adjustment , we need to improve grain production in both breadth and depth , to convert from common varieties to quality and exclusive varieties , from the single production of grain to the overall development of grain plus diversified operations , and from simply providing primary farm products to developing the intensive processing of farm and sideline products .  
Proceeding from China 's national conditions , a national unified , standardized and sound social security system will be established as soon as possible in order to provide important conditions for structural readjustment , reform at a deeper level , and the country 's long-term stability .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
He stressed that since reform and opening up which started more than 20 years ago , relatively great achievements have been scored by China in various economic and social undertakings .  At present , China 's economic structural reform and political structural reform are being simultaneously carried out and continuously deepened .  Governing the country according to laws and building China into a country with socialist legal system have been written in the constitution as the general plan for the administration of the country .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
Chinese leaders have repeatedly pointed out that insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other " persistent economic ailments " are still obstructing China 's economy from developing in a sustained and healthy manner .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
At a summit meeting held in mid-June in ( Fila , ) Portugal , a heated debate erupted between Britain and both Germany and France over expanding the agenda of government-to-government meeting on EU 's structural reform and over the issue of " strengthening cooperation mechanism " within the scope of the " Amsterdam Treaty " .  The essence of the debate involved the " ' two-speed Europe ' or ' nucleus Europe ' " concept and the fundamental problem whether EU will be developed into a " Federal Europe " or a union of a national nature .  
Ye Zhen put it frankly : China 's present economic pickup is more of a product of policy and external factors , as the economic growth is still lacking in intrinsic vitality , the insufficiency of effective social demand has not yet been fundamentally alleviated , economic structural problems are conspicuous , consumer goods market exploitation is still " obstructed , " and the growth of peasants ' income is slowing down .  
For this reason , the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau decided a few days ago to continue to regard " overall control , structural readjustment , and efficiency " as the focus of iron and steel industrial work for a period of time in the future .  Based on this , only by making the most of the favorable opportunity to speed up enterprise technical progress and carry out enterprise organizational structural readjustment can the iron and steel enterprises smoothly participate in international competition before long .  
Through two and a half years of arduous efforts , the losses incurred by Liaoning 's large and medium-sized state enterprises in the state appraisal list were down from over 60 percent to 39.9 percent , while 80 of 100 large and medium-sized state enterprises under the state plan have undergone corporate restructuring .  The provincial industrial economic operation has not only shown a pickup but also witnessed structural changes , laying a solid foundation for securing a decisive victory in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises .  
The official responsible for the State Administration of Environmental Protection said that the main reason for the relatively low rate of key state enterprises fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements is the outstanding structural pollution in the state 's key enterprises , the difficulties in tackling pollution , depression in enterprise production , and a lack of capital .  
lay stress on key issues in their work ; rely on their own strength ; and carry out , in a down-to-earth manner , all the principles and policies that the central authorities have formulated for a sound implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region in connection with both the state enterprise reform and the work of economic structural readjustment .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
pushing forward economic structural readjustment ; improving people 's forecast ; and slowing down a deflationary tendency with the result that we have withstood the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis and maintained steady economic and social development , and for which , we have been highly appraised by the world opinion at large .  
On the other hand , we must see that the factors constraining the economic rebound , such as insufficient effective social demand , conspicuous structural contradictions in the economy , continued " obstructions " to developing the consumer goods market , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes , remain very prominent , and we must maintain effective political direction and support to provide correct guidance for the economic momentum .  
Third , to facilitate the domestic economic and capital structural adjustment and enhance the international competitiveness of the national industries , it is also necessary to formulate new tax policies and adjust the existing ones under the precondition of flexibly applying the WTO rules and in light of the requirements of the state 's new industrial policies .  
However , we should also see that these changes are still initial ones , the foundation of economic recovery has not yet been solid , some structural and deep-seated problems in economic development have not been solved , and the situation of insufficient effective demand has not basically improved .  
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment , the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands .  If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it , we will land ourselves in a passive position .  
In the second half of the year , the macroeconomic situation is taking a turn for the better , and the competitive environment of the telecommunications market is continuously improved ; telecommunications rates will undergo structural readjustment , and their general level will drop , which will greatly stimulate the demand for communication business .  The communication business can be expected to continue its rapid increase .  
Reportedly , the main orientation of the structural adjustments in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan will be as follows : Being oriented to the market , relying on scientific and technological progress and technical innovations , promoting the optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure , and striving to expand domestic demand .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
The central bank should correctly handle the relations between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth , work hard to enhance the level of manipulating monetary policy , regulate money supply in good time , provide positive guidance to credit orientation , give vigorous support to economic structural adjustment , guard against and defuse financial risks , and facilitate the steady rebound of the national economy .  
At present , China 's economic structural reform has entered a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , in which the state-owned enterprise ( SOE ) reform is gradually deepened , the industrial structure is in a period of large-scale adjustment , and reform , opening up , and modernization are faced with new historical missions , for which a stable social environment is especially necessary .  
proceeded in its work from reality and adapted itself to the needs of the society ; achieved a large number of outstanding results in its scientific research ; and made significant contributions to promoting the country 's economic construction and social development , especially to promoting the country 's economic structural reform and political structural reform , the building of democracy and a legal system , and the building of a spiritual civilization .  
Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .  
We should persist in taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the main line , reform and opening up as well as progress in science and technology as the driving force , and improvement in the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point and comprehensively promote economic development and social progress .  
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
With such an operational pattern , we will not only be able to provide peasant households with market information , applied technologies , and management experiences through leading enterprises , but will also be able to find effective solutions to the existing decentralized operation of peasant households , link them up with the general market , bring about a sound integration between production and sales , and speed up the structural adjustment of agriculture .  
Qiu Xiaohua pointed out that in future , China should pay special attention to improving the quality of economic growth and organically integrate structural innovation with technical innovation in order to provide a good economic environment for reform to enter a stage of tackling difficult problems and to fundamentally increase the intrinsic vitality of China 's economy .  
To implement the structural readjustment guiding policies of " give-and-take " and " do something versus do nothing , " Shanghai liberated its thinking , broadened its field of vision , and used reform to set up two highly maneuverable " mechanisms " : One is the motive mechanism that lets the inferior trades and money-losing enterprises get out of the market .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th Party Central Committee proposed that in working out the 10th Five-Year Plan , development be taken as the theme , structural adjustment be taken as the main line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological advancement be taken as the motive force , and the enhancement of people 's living standards be taken as the fundamental starting point .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Owing to the multiple productivity levels , diversified ownership structures , and unbalanced regional economic development in China , we must make structural adjustment in the light of concrete circumstances , exploit the comparative advantages , and pay attention to properly handling the following three relationships : 1 ) The relationship between new high-tech industries and traditional industries ;  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .  
As the state-owned enterprise reform and structural readjustment move ahead due to intensified efforts and as our country 's old-age population grows at an accelerating pace , our country is bound to face a heavier task in guaranteeing basic livelihood for laid-off staff and workers or unemployed personnel and in guaranteeing proper social security for old people in urban areas as well .  Only by building or refining the " safety net " in terms of social security will we be able to maintain social stability ; promote social justice ;  
China 's grain production capacity has rapidly advanced in recent years but the cost has increased progressively at an average annual rate of 10 percent and the structural imbalance between supply and demand has manifested itself increasingly and had a negative effect on increasing peasants ' income and on state finances .  Except for rice , domestic grain prices generally have been 20 percent higher than prices on the world grain market during this period .  
Zeng : In putting the large-scale western development into effect , we should take reform and opening up as a powerful dynamic , make positive exploration , be bold to bring forth new ideas , deepen economic structural reform , and quicken the pace of establishing and perfecting the socialist market economic structure ;  
At the NPC Standing Committee 's request , the arrangements and utilization of long-term treasury construction bonds have focused on expanding domestic demand to spur economic growth , promote structural readjustments , and lay a solid foundation of the country 's long-term development .  Projects already underway were given priority , and preferences were given to the central and western regions , especially the west .  
The animal farming industry should quicken the pace of improving stock breeds and structural adjustments , actively develop the fodder industry and the refined and in-depth processing of animal products , and greatly advance the industrial operation .  
Township and town enterprises should give prominence to the main theme of development , make effort to create a good public opinion , policy , and legal system environment , grasp the three key points of institutional innovation , structural adjustment , and technological progress , and effectively enhance their overall quality and efficiency .  
Abulahat Abdurixit said in his work report : The Ninth Five-Year Plan is the period in which Xinjiang had made the greatest efforts in structural reform , economic restructuring , and infrastructure construction .  Through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities , it has enjoyed sustained national economic growth and increasing comprehensive regional strength .  Its per capita GDP jumped to 7,433 yuan from 4,760 yuan in 1995 , while its GDP basically increased six-fold over 1980 .  
Documents to be published in the bulletin include provincial government regulations ; regulatory documents published by the provincial government ; decisions approved by the provincial government on relevant structural reorganization , changes in administrative districts , and personnel appointments and removals ; regulatory documents published by provincial government departments and affiliated agencies ; selected administrative laws and regulations as well as regulatory documents published by the State Council and its ministries and commissions ; local laws related to government work and relevant decisions and resolution adopted by the provincial people 's congress and its standing committee .  
He pointed out that the year 2001 is the first year for implementing the 10th Five-year Plan in our country .  We must put making great efforts to promote structural readjustment in a prominent position , speed up industrial reorganization and transformation as well as the optimization and upgrading of structure by firmly depending on reform at a deeper level and technical progress , and strive to make considerable and substantive progress in several fundamental aspects and aspects that have a bearing on the overall situation in several years .  
Insofar as Shanghai 's industrial sector at large is concerned , lower tariffs are expected to help textile enterprises , under structural readjustment at the moment , further invite or draw upon advanced foreign technology or products ; to enhance capabilities of developing or introducing new products with hi-tech contents ; or to accelerate structural readjustment as a whole .  
The corporation will further the work of structural transformation and joint-venture or cooperative operation ; will work hard to pluralize property rights , ensure scale operation , and pluralize the principal body of investment for civil products as well ; will focus on developing civil products of high or new technology , which are usable for both military and civil purposes ;  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
Accordingly , in addition to continuing to implement aggressive fiscal policies , we must make a major effort to intensify structural reforms , stimulating the intrinsic driving forces behind economic development , developing new sources of motive power for economic growth , gradually reducing the degree to which economic growth relies on aggressive fiscal policies , and creating a mechanism for sustained , stable development .  
Zhu Mingxian said : At the critical period of China 's economic structural adjustment , it is imperative to firmly seize the quality work as the main direction of attack , which is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demands and practicing the proactive financial policy .  
China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , economic globalization , and the country 's participation in the international division of labor in the economic field all require China to make drastic readjustments to its industrial structure , make best use of its advantages and bypass its disadvantages , and enhance its international competitiveness .  This explains why the 10th Five-Year Plan has made structural readjustment its main line .  Structural readjustment has a fairly extensive connotation , and industrial structural readjustment serves as its core content .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
The four other guiding principles are taking the structural readjustment as the main thread , making reform and opening up and scientific and technical progress as the motive power , improving the living standards of the general public as the starting point , and persisting in a coordinated economic and social development .  
In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .  
Firstly , energetic efforts should be made to push forward economic structural adjustments , give priority to the development of high and new-technology industries while accelerating the reform of traditional industries , speed up the development of modern service industries , and constantly perfect and strengthen its function as a central city . 
It is imperative to further accelerate structural innovation and perfect the market economic system .  In particular , it is necessary to speed up the development of the modern enterprise system and the market system , introduce management systems and operational rules that conform to international practice , and inject fresh vitality into economic development .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .  
In this year 's report , " arable land should be effectively protected " is the second sentence at the beginning of a related paragraph .  It has become the prerequisite of " structural adjustment . "  The report has also stressed that the center of adjustment should be " improving the strains of crops , raising quality and increasing efficiency " while " stabilizing the production of grains . "  
We must change the method of simply considering structural adjustment as increasing or decreasing the acreage of crops , and avoid the practice of developing low level and redundant production and the situation of " everyone has the same thing . "  We should pay attention to keeping local characteristics of agriculture and develop and expand " advantageous crops while making improvements in primary production " so as to let peasants gain maximum benefits in the course of structural adjustment .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on . 
The deputies held that in consolidating the achievements of state enterprise reforms it is essential to adopt methods such as establishing a modern enterprise system , carrying out strategic readjustment of the pattern of state-owned economy , reorganizing the state enterprises , and speeding up technical progress in the enterprises in order to resolve structural obstacles in the state enterprises , foster the enterprises ' capability in technical and system innovation , and establish as soon as possible a social security setup commensurate with the state enterprise reforms .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
Tian Fengshan noted at the meeting : In line with the spirit of the forum , our future land resource management should stress several areas .  In line with the call for " order and compensation , a balance of supply with demand , structural optimization , and intensive efficiency , " we need to go all out to improve the quality of our land resource management , protection , and rational utilization to steadily improve the capability of resources to support sustained economic and social development .  
Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .  
We should hasten to suit these requirements through structural changes in various aspects , and move toward internationalization by merging with the international prevailing standards as soon as possible in terms of the improvement and perfection of administrative and management structure , foreign economic and trade structure , and service system and the concrete operation of agreement negotiations , project examination and approval , interest distributions , and contract fulfillment . 
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries . "  
In the coming five years , it is imperative to unswervingly carry forward reform , open the country wider to the outside world , remove structural barriers hamstringing the development of productive forces , and provide economic development with a powerful dynamic force .

This report will be based on a review of all relevant and latest technical development , local as well as overseas , publications and standards on material deterioration , methods of inspection , investigation , testing , assessment and repair of buildings with particular consideration given to the three major areas of concern under BSIS , that is , integrity of external finishes , structural stability and fire safety .  
The overall business environment of an economy is constituted from a host of structural and institutional factors which in general tend to change only gradually .  It is therefore not easy to understand the sudden drop in ranking between the past and the coming five years , nor the wide fluctuations in future ranking between different rounds .  
Decision-making power for monetary policy must be vested in an agency that is both independent but accountable ; other macroeconomic policies must be harmonised ; and structural policies must support the flexible adjustment needed to accommodate shocks .  
To ensure that the relocation exercise was implemented smoothly , the company set up a Focus Group comprising representatives of both management and staff well in advance of the target date .  Surveys were conducted to collect the employees ' views on various issues of concern to them such as transport arrangement , working hours , the new working environment , procedural changes , structural changes , arrangement during inclement weather etc .  
Over the medium term , rising social expenditures would likely require increases in fees and charges ; in light of the structural changes in the economy , which could alter the existing tax base , there was also a case to review the revenue structure to determine if further revenue diversification was required . 
These reports are bilingual publications in Chinese and English . They contain a wide range of statistics on the structural and operating characteristics of various economic activities for the reference year 1998 , based on data collected from establishments engaged in those sectors .  
It is responsible for examining in detail whether the Government 's projected operating deficits up to 2002-03 are cyclical or structural in nature ; whether the existing tax base , types of tax , tax net and tax rates should be changed , and , if so , what the changes should be . 
Following the announcement made by the Financial Secretary in the 2000-01 Budget , we have established a Task Force and an Advisory Committee . The former is now studying in detail whether the projected consecutive operating deficits until 2002-03 is a cyclical downturn or , more seriously , a structural problem .  It will also conduct a series of detailed studies covering a wide range of revenue items .  
To guard against the dilapidation risk of the older properties , the Approved Sellers will be required to provide a satisfactory valuation report by a qualified valuer confirming that the underlying property is free of any material negative findings or unauthorized structural modifications .  
All newly constructed or substantially altered private buildings are subject to the requirements set out in this new manual .  The only exception is where compliance would impose unjustifiable hardship on the owner concerned ( e.g . where the provision of such facilities in a very small site would render the whole development not viable ) , or where compliance is impracticable because of physical constraints ( e.g . where the presence of a structural ground beam in an existing building would render the provision of a ramp not possible ) .  
While a sharp fiscal correction during the cyclical downturn may not be warranted , the recent drift into a sizable structural deficit will need to be reversed in order to ensure healthy public finances in the longer run .  
For example , if an authorised person or a registered engineer confirms that the rooftop of the building concerned can not support a standard supply tank due to structural or spatial problems , and that no alternative place is available for the installation , FSD will consider accepting a supply tank of a smaller capacity .  
Within the total exports of goods , the forecast increase in real terms in re-exports is raised to 9% from 7% , but the forecast decline in real terms in domestic exports is lowered to 9% from 8% , with the latter adjustment reflecting an accentuated structural shift away from domestic exports to re-exports and offshore trade . 
This would not only increase the Government 's fiscal burden in the future by incurring substantial additional expenditure , but also fail to address the current structural problem of insufficient recurrent revenue to cover recurrent expenditure .  
Under that , landlords might , in the absence of such provision in the tenancy agreement , apply for repossession before the tenancy expires on the ground that the tenant fails to pay rent within 15 days after the due date , uses the leased premises for illegal or immoral purpose , causes unnecessary annoyance , inconvenience or disturbance ( including persistent delay of rent payment ) or makes structural alteration to the leased premises without prior written consent of the landlord .  
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook , credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003 .  This will require the implementation of sizeable structural deficit reduction measures in fiscal year 2003 and a commitment to more substantial consolidation , supported by concrete measures , in the next three years . "  
Along with continuing structural change in Hong Kong 's mode of trade , Hong Kong , apart from being engaged in traditional external trade , is also engaged in other forms of trading called " offshore trade " where the goods involved do not cross Hong Kong 's customs boundary .  
More broadly , Directors emphasized that Hong Kong SAR 's traditional strengths-flexible labor and product markets and strong legal and institutional frameworks-would need to be complemented by sound macroeconomic policies and productivity-increasing structural reforms .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly . The exquisitely carved spirit niche was cut in half , and large wooden structural elements without carvings , such as beams and columns , were thrown away altogether .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
Consequently , private museums established after this law came into effect have been treated precisely the same as large public museums in terms of facilities and organizational requirements : minimum structural support capacities , obstruction-free spaces , or such public safety issues as fire safety are all scrutinized against the standards governing large museums .  
People in their prime years ( 30s and 40s ) have always been considered the elite of the employment structure , positioned as they are between inexperienced workers and aging seniors . But in recent years , there have been dramatic structural changes in the employment market . Unemployment and forced career changes have become increasingly common among workers in their prime .  
Tunghai University 's architecture team , the group responsible for the design , after discussing with structural engineers utilized a " sandwich " technique to build the walls . The walls ' outward appearance preserves tradition in its use of stone slabs from 40 to 50 centimeters thick . However , the interior of the walls is made of steel-reinforced concrete , allowing them to satisfy structural safety requirements in addition to displaying traditional features .

Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
All available tools - trade , investment and structural adjustment - must be brought to bear on the problem of the marginalization of least developed countries , and there must be close cooperation between WTO , various organs of the United Nations system , the Bretton Woods organizations , and the various regional bodies to ensure that the resources and expertise of the international community remained focused , coordinated and relevant to the most pressing global needs . 
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
This climate - amounting to a virtual social psychosis - is aggravated by the stringent economic pressures felt by ordinary people as a result of macroeconomic structural readjustment measures .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
We have taken measures to consolidate parliamentary democracy through constitutional means ; to restore financial equilibrium through austerity and structural adjustments while enhancing business incentives and economic liberalization ; to combat corruption , drugs and terrorism which is often sponsored from abroad through effective law enforcement and speedy and fair justice .  
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
The Task Force on Employment and Sustainable Livelihoods conducted one review in a country where poverty eradication was the primary focus in a setting of low economic growth and rapid labour force expansion ; in another country , the main concern was how to move from structural adjustment to growth with equity ; in another , the review focused on the employment aspects associated with a shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
The events of 28 September 1995 , during which an army of international mercenaries invaded my country , overthrew the President of the Republic , disrupted constitutional order and , consequently , State institutions , further worsened our economic crisis and led to substantial material losses and structural damage .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
The safety of space NPS at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents will be ensured by safety systems and NPS structural elements designed to meet safety requirements , and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
States should cooperate in facilitating more rational and equitable international economic relations and in encouraging structural changes in the context of a balanced economy in harmony with the needs and interests of all countries , especially developing countries , and should take appropriate measures to this end .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
In a statement submitted to the General Assembly in 1996 ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 25 and Corr . 1 , annex ) ACC stressed the importance of there being simultaneous movement on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire principle . 
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
In the event , a persistent failure to implement a coherent programme of structural reform finally came to a head in Bulgaria in the spring of 1996 with a massive financial and economic crisis which has still to be resolved ; instead of growing by a forecast 3 per cent , Bulgarian GDP actually fell by 10 per cent . 
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Many lack the capacity to articulate a long-term vision , an integrated policy framework and coherent programming or lack the capacity for policy reconciliation between sustained economic growth and sustainable development or between structural adjustment and social stability .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
The Committee was concerned that within the framework of economic and structural changes , including those arising from regional and international economic arrangements , insufficient attention had been paid to their impact on women in general and on disadvantaged women in particular .  
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
He urged the international community to adopt specific measures to stabilize the international economic environment , thereby supporting the developing countries in their efforts to mitigate the political and social costs of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms , rather than simply limiting themselves to the re-establishment of their credit ratings and the liberalization of their markets at all costs .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
He urged the international community to increase direct foreign investment , especially in Africa , as it was insufficient despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by the developing countries in order to create a favourable economic environment . 
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
However , despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of developing countries , including Mozambique , had implemented structural adjustment programmes , liberalized their economies and undertaken other reforms which had had serious social consequences , financial resource flows had diminished , resulting in a vicious circle of economic stagnation and financial crisis .  
In its decision 1997 / 103 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to request the Chairman of the Commission , in consultation with the regional groups , to appoint an independent expert to study the effects of structural adjustment policies on economic , social and cultural rights , to be submitted to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session . 
In its decision 1998 / 102 , the Commission requested the independent expert to submit his report as envisioned in decision 1997 / 103 for consideration by the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights , which is scheduled to meet from 1 to 5 March 1999 . 
While stabilization strategy is designed to calm financial and economic turbulence by curbing high inflation rates and curtailing enormous budget deficits in the short term , structural adjustment is aimed at restructuring the productive capacities in order to increase efficiency and help restore growth and , therefore , extends over the medium and long term .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
As reflected in paragraphs 12 and 13 of its eleventh report on the programme budget for the biennium 1990-1991 , 1 / the Advisory Committee agreed with the Secretary-General 's conclusion that a structural change in the level of the emoluments of the members of the Court was justified at that time and recommended that the annual salary of members of the Court be set at $ 145,000 , effective 1 January 1991 , with the next review to take place no later than three years from 1 January 1991 .  
Calling for common action to tackle development challenges arising from globalization and the adverse effects of the financial crisis , ACC members committed themselves to working together to monitor the impact of the crisis on societies and individuals , help individual countries carry out the necessary structural and institutional reforms , and strengthen or build basic social services , livelihood opportunities and safety nets for the least fortunate .  
While recent steps taken by some international financial institutions , including the World Bank , have aimed at better integration of social concerns into the design of structural adjustment programmes , the International Monetary Fund has sometimes given inadequate attention to protecting public spending even for essential social services .  
As stated in the Secretary-Generals report on human resources management ( A / 53 / 342 , para . 52 ) , the Organizations career development policy is based on the principle that responsibility for career growth and development is shared : by the Organization , which must provide structural support and a framework of opportunities ; by managers , who must support their staffs development and career progress ; and by the staff members themselves , who must be committed to continuous professional growth .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
The policies of structural adjustment pursued in the 1980s probably contributed in many places to intensified tension between the different ethnic , racial or social groups in society , and may have had enormous cost in terms of lost development opportunities and may have hampered many groups in their enjoyment of the right to food . 
We also reaffirm that , as set forth at the Fourth World Conference on Women , we are determined to promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
It became known again as the pearl of Africa in the early 1990s , when peace and security had been re _ established in most parts of the country , a public administration had been built to provide essential services and a structural adjustment programme had been successfully implemented , keeping the rate of economic growth above 6 per cent , while servicing a huge debt . 
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
The region can no longer rely on cheap labour or raw materials for its structural transformation but rather must shift to improving the productivity of its labour , effectively transforming its static comparative advantages to dynamic competitive advantages .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
This approach can now be embedded into substantially improved policy conditions and a strengthened policy framework resulting from structural adjustment , trade and investment liberalization : exchange rates are now aligned with markets , quantitative import restrictions widely removed , investment policies largely liberalized , and domestic policies considerably strengthened .  Economic integration can build on this progress and deepen the process further .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
Item 10 : An open-ended working group established to elaborate policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( Commission decision 1999 / 104 , Economic and Social Council decision 1999 / 251 ) is scheduled to meet from 28 February to 10 March 2000 ;  
Mr .

As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The worsening of the debt situation of middle-income and some lower-middle-income countries was due not only to the incapacity to pay debt obligations owing to temporary shortfalls in revenues but also to the more structural problem of raising sufficient revenue , particularly hard currency , in the long term to service their debts , while preserving their sustained economic growth and development .

How can we move beyond the Copenhagen commitments when official development assistance has declined to a meagre 0.22 per cent , when assistance to developing countries is increasingly conditional , and when developing countries are prescribed structural adjustment programmes and prescriptions that take no account of social priorities or national characteristics ?  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .

The incipient organizational and structural transformation of the IPU into a genuine union of parliaments of the entire world , and the adaptation of its agenda to the whole range of issues addressed by the United Nations , will help to enhance the role of the United Nations itself , endowing it with a new parliamentary dimension .  
Therefore we hope to continue to have the solidarity and the support of the United Nations system , as well as of international financial organizations and the donor community , especially those that pledged their commitment in the Stockholm Declaration , as their invaluable assistance is vital in order to overcome the structural problems underlying the effects of natural disasters .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .

While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The key idea that had gained favour within the United Nations system and the international economic institutions that they should coordinate their efforts to achieve consistent , comprehensive development , taking account of every dimension , including the human ignored , whether deliberately or not , the two essential factors , namely financing for development and the structural faults in the mechanisms of the world economy .

Both countries sustained heavy losses of human life and much of their infrastructure and productive economic base have been destroyed , casting more doubts upon the future prospects of these countries to address structural poverty and underdevelopment .  
In retrospect , for some developing countries the period of the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the heavy burden of debt servicing , falling commodity prices , negative economic growth , unemployment and structural adjustment .  
This initiative , launched in 1998 by the World Bank , is based on the principle that an appropriate financial and macroeconomic framework is essential to any action , but that the social , structural and human aspects are essential too .  
The policies and actions of international financial institutions that advocated such liberalization and stressed structural adjustment and fiscal prudence when the crisis struck were viewed by many as exacerbating the negative social impact of the crisis .

In order to enhance efficiency and to establish a collaborative relationship for social development between the public and private sectors , bold structural adjustments and regulatory reforms have been implemented .  
It was considered that the narrative should have included references to the effects of endemic structural adjustments and to the negative impact of the economic crisis at the international level which affected developing countries .

Fourthly , conflict prevention actions , whether of an operational or structural nature , should be sensitive not only to existing local conditions , but also to the historical and cultural contexts of a potential conflict .  
In addition to problems stemming from a process of structural and economic reforms in order to establish a basic framework for a market economy , the country was hit by the financial crisis in 1998 in the Russian Federation , a major trading partner , a serious drought and rising prices for imported energy , on which the country is heavily dependent .  
In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
The Commission appointed Mr . Fantu Cheru as independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;

National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .  
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
These included : the worsening of the food security problem ; the structural difficulty of achieving competitiveness within the current international agricultural markets ; and the strong dependency on exports from this sector for the acquisition of hard currency .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
The national programmes of action identified the difficulties and constraints faced by least developed countries and the required national and international support measures to eradicate poverty , overcome the structural bottlenecks in least developed countries and put these countries on the path of accelerated growth and sustainable development .  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
The context can not be viewed in isolation ; we must also consider the various related factors , such as the costly structural adjustments that we have been making to our economies in accordance with international financial requirements , the heavy foreign debt burden and the unequal conditions that persist in world trade , which have limited our steady development .  
Item 10 : An open-ended working group established to elaborate policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights is provisionally scheduled to meet from 25 February to 8 March 2002 ;  
" All industrial nations should implement sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that are necessary to sustain robust domestic demands and hence , create multiple engines to promote economic growth , " he said . 
Amidst structural adjustments this year , Hainan special zone 's economy has realized steady and healthy development and is estimated to have an annual rate of economic increase reaching 6.7% , increasing by 1.9% over last year .  
Our reporter has learned from relevant sources within the China State Planning Commission that development of China 's high-tech industry will proceed in conformity with promoting economic and social development and stimulating structural adjustments and upgrading .  Currently , three main responsibilities have been identified :  
As S &amp; T have developed briskly throughout the world and economic structural adjustment has accelerated , and impacted by the Asian financial crisis , a certain international deflationary state has appeared .  This has also had a definite impact on China 's overall prices .  
Hard supply refers to the low-level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form .  Since our market lacks elimination-through-competition forces , with enterprises lacking innovative skills , this hard supply is not corrected promptly and effectively .  
For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
It is necessary to properly handle the direction and intensity of macro regulation and control , combine internal demand expansion , structural readjustment , scientific and technological progress , and opening up to the outside work , accelerate the fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic growth modes , and strive to uplift the development of the national economy to a new stage .  
The practical industrial structural adjustment has laid a sound industrial foundation for Hainan , enabling the province 's economy to develop rapidly and the economic results to improve ; as a result , the quality of its economic growth has improved notably .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
Having gone through the change from " getting rich overnight " to " working in the light of the reality , " many Hainan deputies said with deep reflection : Industrial structural adjustment must be carried out in the light of local conditions and we must be pragmatic .  Only by doing so can we achieve practical results and ensure sustainable economic and social development .  
Key topics discussed by the deputies in their speeches were active efforts to seize the great opportunities presented to Sichuan by the development of the western region , exploitation of resources , ecological protection , economic structural adjustment , better incomes for the peasants , and vigorous efforts to develop scientific educational undertakings .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that positively pushing forward the strategic economic structural adjustment is a fundamental measure to give impetus to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and elevate the quality and efficiency of the economic growth .  This is both a long-term mission and a pressing economic task of the moment .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
In light of the situation in Yunnan , indeed , only by maintaining relatively rapid economic growth under the precondition of enhancing effectiveness can the enterprises ' difficulty in production and operation be mitigated , the pressure of employment be lessened , and the structural adjustment and in-depth reformed be promoted , so that financial revenue can be increased , financial risks be prevented , and social stability be maintained .  
A new round of structural adjustment is being carried out throughout the world ; new - and high-technology industry and newly emerging industry are developing robust ; intellectual economy has raged like a storm , and world economic competition has become increasingly intense .  
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
As a result of economic and trade cooperation with the mainland , the proportions of primary and secondary industries in the island 's total output value have kept declining , while that of tertiary industry has gradually risen , thereby effectively promoting Taiwan 's economic transformation and industrial structural adjustment .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
We should put the improvement of quality and enhancement of economic result high on the agenda .  Guided by the market , we should make active efforts to push forward the structural adjustment , do a good job in controlling total supply and total demand , resolutely eliminate enterprises with inferior production capability , and avoid making the same mistake of duplicating construction projects .  We should integrate the periodical goal with the long-term goal of carrying out the reform and development of state-owned enterprises .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
The socialist market economic structure is the designated model for the economic structural reform in China , it marks the forsaking of the highly centralized conventional planned economic structure of the past , and it is substantially different from the capitalist market economy .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
Therefore , we should understand the vital significance of structural adjustment from the strategic point of view , speed up the economic structural adjustment and upgrading , and cultivate and bring up the industries and products with strong competitive power .  Only in this way can we remain invincible in the increasingly vehement international competition in the 21st century .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
To establish the structural design of nuclear weapons devices , Guo Yonghuai proposed " proceeding along two parallel roads and choosing the superior one in the end " in order to determine the optimum plan for the first nuclear bomb detonation , which played a decisive role in deciding several critical questions .  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Speeding up the establishment of a social security system is now the key issue in deepening enterprise reform and speeding up structural adjustment ; it has a bearing on efforts by enterprises to separate out their social functions and cut personnel to improve efficiency , on whether the reassignment of laid-off personnel to other jobs can move forward or not , and on whether the task of upgrading the industrial structure and improving enterprise efficiency can be accomplished smoothly .  It has become a critical task .  
While making conscientious efforts to run existing social security services well , we will speed up the formation of a social security system that is independent of enterprises and institutions , has diverse sources of funding and a standardized system of support services , and is run and managed by society , in order to guarantee the smooth progress of state-owned enterprise reform and structural adjustment and maintain the basic stability of society .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
The main role of the government is to create a favorable macroeconomic environment for structural readjustment by improving macroeconomic regulation and control , pressing ahead with reform , restoring market order through economic policy , providing public services , and concentrating its energies on major projects .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
Given that the degree of marketization is increasing all the time , and agricultural development is shifting from being mainly constrained by resources to being doubly constrained by resources and demand , structural contradictions are extremely conspicuous , relative surpluses of a phased and structural nature have emerged in agricultural products , sales are sluggish , prices have fallen , and the comparative returns on agriculture have declined year by year .  
" Primary Industry " Will Fall While " Tertiary Industry " Will RiseThe Outline proposes that the principal anticipated targets for China 's economic structural adjustment be as follows : By 2005 , the proportions of added value of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries held in the GDP will be 13 percent , 51 percent , and 36 percent respectively , and the proportions of employees in these industries held in the total employees of entire society will be 44 percent , 23 percent , and 33 percent respectively . 
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
Despite widespread concern that a US economic slowdown will affect China 's foreign capital intake , a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation expressed optimism : This year China will maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also will cause a significant structural improvement .  
Ma Xiuhong pointed out that China 's foreign capital intake proved to continue the dramatic upward trend in the first quarter of the year .  She believed that this year China would maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also would cause a marked structural improvement .  
To actively provide effective services for readjusting the rural economic structure and increasing peasants ' income , the vast number of rural grassroots cadres should study in depth the conspicuous contradictions in local agriculture and the rural economic structure , get their ideas into shape , draw up and perfect plans for structural readjustment and economic development in the light of local conditions , and go from village to village , household to household to properly determine measures for readjusting the economic structure and increasing income .  
Experts taking part in the survey said that in the course of the work , they chose a total of 10 topics of common concern , which included economic growth , increase in income , structural reform , punishing corruption , and urban employment , to test the satisfaction of residents with social life .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
Relocation of enterprises in the project area should be closely linked to adjustment of the economic structure and structural adjustment of enterprises , and no construction of low-standard redundant projects is allowed .  Enterprises that ought to be shut down should be decidedly shut down , and those ought to go bankrupt should declare bankrupt according to the legal procedures .  Staff members and workers of enterprises shut down and declared bankrupt should be properly taken care of and basic needs for their daily life should be ensured .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
In an editorial on 7 June , the China Times pointed out structural factors behind the island 's current economic malaise .  If the root cause of the problems is not dealt with and if overhasty actions are adopted , the paper stated , economic problems would only be made even more complicated and intractable .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The Chinese government will continue to make development the main theme , make structural adjustment the main line , make reform and opening up and technical progress the motivation , make raising the people 's living standards the fundamental objective , and industriously take steps forward for economic development and social advance .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
We should study the new phenomenon that corruption breeds and becomes rampant during the period of economic structural change and rapid economic growth .  We should further define our thinking and policy , based on the analysis and study , for the case handling work under the new circumstances .  Only in this way can we firmly keep the initiative in our hands during the anti-corruption struggle and punish corruption in a more forceful and effective way .  
Wen Jiabao stressed : We must seize the opportune time before us to vigorously advance the cotton circulation structural reform and be sure to make a breakthrough so as to lay a sound foundation for promoting healthy development of the country 's cotton production and enhancing the international competitiveness of our cotton textiles .  
This is the fundamental orientation and long-term goal of this round of cotton circulation structural reform as well as an effective way of increasing the cotton industry 's economic returns and cotton farmers ' income and raising the level of modernization of cotton production and processing .  
Wen Jiabao stressed : The 2001 cotton year is coming soon .  Making a good job of cotton purchase and marketing in the new year will be of extremely great significance to deepening the cotton circulation structural reform , stabilizing cotton production , protecting the farmers ' interests , and promoting sustained , healthy development of the textile industry .  
We have laid down a plan for national economic and social development for the coming five years .  We will persistently take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal and continue to push forward reform , opening up , and the modernization drive .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .  Under such circumstances , financial loopholes , violations of the financial law and discipline , and government corruption are inevitable .  
The 10th Five-Year Plan period will prove a crucial transitional period after China joins the WTO . Basing on the relative advantages and disadvantages of China 's major industries in international competitions , the " Special Plan for the WTO Accession " has clearly put forward the orientation , priorities , and key measures for the structural readjustment and the reform of these industries .  
The speech expounded in an all-round way the important guiding principles put forward by the fifth plenary session on comprehensively pushing forward economic development and social progress by making development the theme ; structural adjustment the main line ; reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force ;  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
In view of this , we should select a number of key areas , such as equipment manufacturing , the deep-processing of farm products , clean coal , and the comprehensive utilization of resources ; speed up the development of common technologies , key technologies , and supporting technologies that can give an impetus to structural upgrading ; and accelerate the technical upgrading of traditional industries .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .  
According to initial revelations , continuing to increase domestic demand , carrying out structural adjustments , pressing ahead with the great development of the western region , deepening reform of state-owned enterprises , stepping up efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and improving the social welfare and insurance systems , will be the vital parts of the report .  
Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
As the economy has been consistently mired in recessionary crises since the start of the transition , structural adjustment has been implemented not through manipulating differences in growth rate of different economic sectors , but through manipulating differences in the rate of decline of the sectors , resulting in the prominent negative and passive characters of the structural adjustment .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .  
To change the abnormal state of structural changes in the previous period , the Putin government has emphasized that its is necessary to shake off the lasting crisis as soon as possible and to stimulate rapid economic growth first and , then , to carry out sound economic structural adjustments on the basis of rapid economic growth .  
Enterprise structural adjustment means acting in lines affecting the pulse of the national economy with particularly marked efficiency of scale to amass effective resources through the market , forming production and operations of scale , to turn them into pillars in key lines and fields of the national economy , leaders in economic structural adjustment , representative participants in international competition , and the key forces for state regulation and control of the economy . 
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .

Enterprise closure and bankruptcy should center around key industries such as the iron and steel , coal , refined sugar , nonferrous metals , textile , and war industries that are undergoing structural readjustments .  For specific projects already approved , we should deal with each as it matures , work on one project at a time , and stabilize one project at a time .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
The meeting maintained that in light of the bumper harvests of grain for many years in a row and the phased situation of supply exceeding demand , the party 's central committee and the State Council have formulated a series of powerful policies and measures , particularly the one to promote grain circulation structural reform with stress on the " three policies and one reform , " and attained remarkable results .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central authorities , various localities and departments concerned have accelerated the structural adjustment of agriculture and grain production , persisted in procuring peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices without restriction , increased the intensity of selling grain at favorable prices , tightened the management of grain purchasing funds and grain markets , and pushed forward the reform of grain procuring and marketing enterprises .  
Practice has fully proven that the central policies on grain reform are entirely correct and have played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for grain production , giving impetus to agricultural structural adjustment , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
Through structural adjustment , we need to improve grain production in both breadth and depth , to convert from common varieties to quality and exclusive varieties , from the single production of grain to the overall development of grain plus diversified operations , and from simply providing primary farm products to developing the intensive processing of farm and sideline products .  
Proceeding from China 's national conditions , a national unified , standardized and sound social security system will be established as soon as possible in order to provide important conditions for structural readjustment , reform at a deeper level , and the country 's long-term stability .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
He stressed that since reform and opening up which started more than 20 years ago , relatively great achievements have been scored by China in various economic and social undertakings .  At present , China 's economic structural reform and political structural reform are being simultaneously carried out and continuously deepened .  Governing the country according to laws and building China into a country with socialist legal system have been written in the constitution as the general plan for the administration of the country .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
Chinese leaders have repeatedly pointed out that insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other " persistent economic ailments " are still obstructing China 's economy from developing in a sustained and healthy manner .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
At a summit meeting held in mid-June in ( Fila , ) Portugal , a heated debate erupted between Britain and both Germany and France over expanding the agenda of government-to-government meeting on EU 's structural reform and over the issue of " strengthening cooperation mechanism " within the scope of the " Amsterdam Treaty " .  The essence of the debate involved the " ' two-speed Europe ' or ' nucleus Europe ' " concept and the fundamental problem whether EU will be developed into a " Federal Europe " or a union of a national nature .  
Ye Zhen put it frankly : China 's present economic pickup is more of a product of policy and external factors , as the economic growth is still lacking in intrinsic vitality , the insufficiency of effective social demand has not yet been fundamentally alleviated , economic structural problems are conspicuous , consumer goods market exploitation is still " obstructed , " and the growth of peasants ' income is slowing down .  
For this reason , the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau decided a few days ago to continue to regard " overall control , structural readjustment , and efficiency " as the focus of iron and steel industrial work for a period of time in the future .  Based on this , only by making the most of the favorable opportunity to speed up enterprise technical progress and carry out enterprise organizational structural readjustment can the iron and steel enterprises smoothly participate in international competition before long .  
Through two and a half years of arduous efforts , the losses incurred by Liaoning 's large and medium-sized state enterprises in the state appraisal list were down from over 60 percent to 39.9 percent , while 80 of 100 large and medium-sized state enterprises under the state plan have undergone corporate restructuring .  The provincial industrial economic operation has not only shown a pickup but also witnessed structural changes , laying a solid foundation for securing a decisive victory in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises .  
The official responsible for the State Administration of Environmental Protection said that the main reason for the relatively low rate of key state enterprises fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements is the outstanding structural pollution in the state 's key enterprises , the difficulties in tackling pollution , depression in enterprise production , and a lack of capital .  
lay stress on key issues in their work ; rely on their own strength ; and carry out , in a down-to-earth manner , all the principles and policies that the central authorities have formulated for a sound implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region in connection with both the state enterprise reform and the work of economic structural readjustment .  
Third , by way of structural readjustment , the province should close down a number of small factories and small mines which are plagued by backward production techniques and unmarketable products and which have caused a huge waste of resources and a heavy pollution to the environment ; meanwhile , to meet the demands of the modern enterprise system , the province should extend support to a number of dominating enterprises which have a great bearing on the country 's overall situation , and should further readjust and optimize its industrial structure .  
pushing forward economic structural readjustment ; improving people 's forecast ; and slowing down a deflationary tendency with the result that we have withstood the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis and maintained steady economic and social development , and for which , we have been highly appraised by the world opinion at large .  
On the other hand , we must see that the factors constraining the economic rebound , such as insufficient effective social demand , conspicuous structural contradictions in the economy , continued " obstructions " to developing the consumer goods market , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes , remain very prominent , and we must maintain effective political direction and support to provide correct guidance for the economic momentum .  
Third , to facilitate the domestic economic and capital structural adjustment and enhance the international competitiveness of the national industries , it is also necessary to formulate new tax policies and adjust the existing ones under the precondition of flexibly applying the WTO rules and in light of the requirements of the state 's new industrial policies .  
However , we should also see that these changes are still initial ones , the foundation of economic recovery has not yet been solid , some structural and deep-seated problems in economic development have not been solved , and the situation of insufficient effective demand has not basically improved .  
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment , the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands .  If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it , we will land ourselves in a passive position .  
In the second half of the year , the macroeconomic situation is taking a turn for the better , and the competitive environment of the telecommunications market is continuously improved ; telecommunications rates will undergo structural readjustment , and their general level will drop , which will greatly stimulate the demand for communication business .  The communication business can be expected to continue its rapid increase .  
Reportedly , the main orientation of the structural adjustments in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan will be as follows : Being oriented to the market , relying on scientific and technological progress and technical innovations , promoting the optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure , and striving to expand domestic demand .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
The central bank should correctly handle the relations between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth , work hard to enhance the level of manipulating monetary policy , regulate money supply in good time , provide positive guidance to credit orientation , give vigorous support to economic structural adjustment , guard against and defuse financial risks , and facilitate the steady rebound of the national economy .  
At present , China 's economic structural reform has entered a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , in which the state-owned enterprise ( SOE ) reform is gradually deepened , the industrial structure is in a period of large-scale adjustment , and reform , opening up , and modernization are faced with new historical missions , for which a stable social environment is especially necessary .  
proceeded in its work from reality and adapted itself to the needs of the society ; achieved a large number of outstanding results in its scientific research ; and made significant contributions to promoting the country 's economic construction and social development , especially to promoting the country 's economic structural reform and political structural reform , the building of democracy and a legal system , and the building of a spiritual civilization .  
Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .  
We should persist in taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the main line , reform and opening up as well as progress in science and technology as the driving force , and improvement in the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point and comprehensively promote economic development and social progress .  
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
With such an operational pattern , we will not only be able to provide peasant households with market information , applied technologies , and management experiences through leading enterprises , but will also be able to find effective solutions to the existing decentralized operation of peasant households , link them up with the general market , bring about a sound integration between production and sales , and speed up the structural adjustment of agriculture .  
Qiu Xiaohua pointed out that in future , China should pay special attention to improving the quality of economic growth and organically integrate structural innovation with technical innovation in order to provide a good economic environment for reform to enter a stage of tackling difficult problems and to fundamentally increase the intrinsic vitality of China 's economy .  
To implement the structural readjustment guiding policies of " give-and-take " and " do something versus do nothing , " Shanghai liberated its thinking , broadened its field of vision , and used reform to set up two highly maneuverable " mechanisms " : One is the motive mechanism that lets the inferior trades and money-losing enterprises get out of the market .

Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Owing to the multiple productivity levels , diversified ownership structures , and unbalanced regional economic development in China , we must make structural adjustment in the light of concrete circumstances , exploit the comparative advantages , and pay attention to properly handling the following three relationships : 1 ) The relationship between new high-tech industries and traditional industries ;

As the state-owned enterprise reform and structural readjustment move ahead due to intensified efforts and as our country 's old-age population grows at an accelerating pace , our country is bound to face a heavier task in guaranteeing basic livelihood for laid-off staff and workers or unemployed personnel and in guaranteeing proper social security for old people in urban areas as well .  Only by building or refining the " safety net " in terms of social security will we be able to maintain social stability ; promote social justice ;  
China 's grain production capacity has rapidly advanced in recent years but the cost has increased progressively at an average annual rate of 10 percent and the structural imbalance between supply and demand has manifested itself increasingly and had a negative effect on increasing peasants ' income and on state finances .

He pointed out that the year 2001 is the first year for implementing the 10th Five-year Plan in our country .  We must put making great efforts to promote structural readjustment in a prominent position , speed up industrial reorganization and transformation as well as the optimization and upgrading of structure by firmly depending on reform at a deeper level and technical progress , and strive to make considerable and substantive progress in several fundamental aspects and aspects that have a bearing on the overall situation in several years .  
Insofar as Shanghai 's industrial sector at large is concerned , lower tariffs are expected to help textile enterprises , under structural readjustment at the moment , further invite or draw upon advanced foreign technology or products ; to enhance capabilities of developing or introducing new products with hi-tech contents ; or to accelerate structural readjustment as a whole .  
The corporation will further the work of structural transformation and joint-venture or cooperative operation ; will work hard to pluralize property rights , ensure scale operation , and pluralize the principal body of investment for civil products as well ; will focus on developing civil products of high or new technology , which are usable for both military and civil purposes ;  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
Accordingly , in addition to continuing to implement aggressive fiscal policies , we must make a major effort to intensify structural reforms , stimulating the intrinsic driving forces behind economic development , developing new sources of motive power for economic growth , gradually reducing the degree to which economic growth relies on aggressive fiscal policies , and creating a mechanism for sustained , stable development .  
Zhu Mingxian said : At the critical period of China 's economic structural adjustment , it is imperative to firmly seize the quality work as the main direction of attack , which is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demands and practicing the proactive financial policy .  
China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , economic globalization , and the country 's participation in the international division of labor in the economic field all require China to make drastic readjustments to its industrial structure , make best use of its advantages and bypass its disadvantages , and enhance its international competitiveness .  This explains why the 10th Five-Year Plan has made structural readjustment its main line .  Structural readjustment has a fairly extensive connotation , and industrial structural readjustment serves as its core content .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
The four other guiding principles are taking the structural readjustment as the main thread , making reform and opening up and scientific and technical progress as the motive power , improving the living standards of the general public as the starting point , and persisting in a coordinated economic and social development .  
In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .  
Firstly , energetic efforts should be made to push forward economic structural adjustments , give priority to the development of high and new-technology industries while accelerating the reform of traditional industries , speed up the development of modern service industries , and constantly perfect and strengthen its function as a central city .

To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .  
In this year 's report , " arable land should be effectively protected " is the second sentence at the beginning of a related paragraph .  It has become the prerequisite of " structural adjustment . "  The report has also stressed that the center of adjustment should be " improving the strains of crops , raising quality and increasing efficiency " while " stabilizing the production of grains . "  
We must change the method of simply considering structural adjustment as increasing or decreasing the acreage of crops , and avoid the practice of developing low level and redundant production and the situation of " everyone has the same thing . "  We should pay attention to keeping local characteristics of agriculture and develop and expand " advantageous crops while making improvements in primary production " so as to let peasants gain maximum benefits in the course of structural adjustment .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on .

According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
Tian Fengshan noted at the meeting : In line with the spirit of the forum , our future land resource management should stress several areas .  In line with the call for " order and compensation , a balance of supply with demand , structural optimization , and intensive efficiency , " we need to go all out to improve the quality of our land resource management , protection , and rational utilization to steadily improve the capability of resources to support sustained economic and social development .  
Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .  
We should hasten to suit these requirements through structural changes in various aspects , and move toward internationalization by merging with the international prevailing standards as soon as possible in terms of the improvement and perfection of administrative and management structure , foreign economic and trade structure , and service system and the concrete operation of agreement negotiations , project examination and approval , interest distributions , and contract fulfillment .

The overall business environment of an economy is constituted from a host of structural and institutional factors which in general tend to change only gradually .  It is therefore not easy to understand the sudden drop in ranking between the past and the coming five years , nor the wide fluctuations in future ranking between different rounds .  
Decision-making power for monetary policy must be vested in an agency that is both independent but accountable ; other macroeconomic policies must be harmonised ; and structural policies must support the flexible adjustment needed to accommodate shocks .

It is responsible for examining in detail whether the Government 's projected operating deficits up to 2002-03 are cyclical or structural in nature ; whether the existing tax base , types of tax , tax net and tax rates should be changed , and , if so , what the changes should be . 
Following the announcement made by the Financial Secretary in the 2000-01 Budget , we have established a Task Force and an Advisory Committee . The former is now studying in detail whether the projected consecutive operating deficits until 2002-03 is a cyclical downturn or , more seriously , a structural problem .  It will also conduct a series of detailed studies covering a wide range of revenue items .  
To guard against the dilapidation risk of the older properties , the Approved Sellers will be required to provide a satisfactory valuation report by a qualified valuer confirming that the underlying property is free of any material negative findings or unauthorized structural modifications .  
All newly constructed or substantially altered private buildings are subject to the requirements set out in this new manual .  The only exception is where compliance would impose unjustifiable hardship on the owner concerned ( e.g . where the provision of such facilities in a very small site would render the whole development not viable ) , or where compliance is impracticable because of physical constraints ( e.g . where the presence of a structural ground beam in an existing building would render the provision of a ramp not possible ) .  
While a sharp fiscal correction during the cyclical downturn may not be warranted , the recent drift into a sizable structural deficit will need to be reversed in order to ensure healthy public finances in the longer run .  
For example , if an authorised person or a registered engineer confirms that the rooftop of the building concerned can not support a standard supply tank due to structural or spatial problems , and that no alternative place is available for the installation , FSD will consider accepting a supply tank of a smaller capacity .  
Within the total exports of goods , the forecast increase in real terms in re-exports is raised to 9% from 7% , but the forecast decline in real terms in domestic exports is lowered to 9% from 8% , with the latter adjustment reflecting an accentuated structural shift away from domestic exports to re-exports and offshore trade . 
This would not only increase the Government 's fiscal burden in the future by incurring substantial additional expenditure , but also fail to address the current structural problem of insufficient recurrent revenue to cover recurrent expenditure .  
Under that , landlords might , in the absence of such provision in the tenancy agreement , apply for repossession before the tenancy expires on the ground that the tenant fails to pay rent within 15 days after the due date , uses the leased premises for illegal or immoral purpose , causes unnecessary annoyance , inconvenience or disturbance ( including persistent delay of rent payment ) or makes structural alteration to the leased premises without prior written consent of the landlord .  
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook , credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003 .

"  
Along with continuing structural change in Hong Kong 's mode of trade , Hong Kong , apart from being engaged in traditional external trade , is also engaged in other forms of trading called " offshore trade " where the goods involved do not cross Hong Kong 's customs boundary .  
More broadly , Directors emphasized that Hong Kong SAR 's traditional strengths-flexible labor and product markets and strong legal and institutional frameworks-would need to be complemented by sound macroeconomic policies and productivity-increasing structural reforms .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly .

" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women .

Tunghai University 's architecture team , the group responsible for the design , after discussing with structural engineers utilized a " sandwich " technique to build the walls . The walls ' outward appearance preserves tradition in its use of stone slabs from 40 to 50 centimeters thick . However , the interior of the walls is made of steel-reinforced concrete , allowing them to satisfy structural safety requirements in addition to displaying traditional features .  
In order to resolve the controversy over the relative importance of " national security " and " economic development , " when I was minister of economic affairs I raised a new idea : " The internationalization of Taiwan 's economic position is the best guarantee of national security . " We have to depart from the previous conservative , defensive viewpoint of security , and instead adopt a viewpoint of actively strengthening our structural position .  
It occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters , and cost NT $ 380 million to build . The idea for its design came from the historical vicissitudes of the archeological discoveries , and from the first peoples who crossed the sea in boats to come to Taiwan . The museum is built in three disparate architectural styles , representing the connection between mountains and sea , between past and present . The arched steel-framed structure symbolizes the sea , with the structural layout employing outward radiating lines to indicate the ocean .  
" In the last few years , the government has come out with a number of preferential tax policies , with bizarre results , " says Steve Tsui .

The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
Apart from the structural damage to the campus , there was great social turmoil throughout Taiwan with virtually every industry hurting and inflation running rampant . As the population suffered , a dark cloud of discontent gathered . Finally , the February 28 Incident of 1947 erupted when the authorities enforced monopolistic control over the sale of cigarettes .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
A six-storied building located on Waxili Baowen Blvd . was built in 1930 and suffered partial structural damage in the 1977 earthquake .  However , the unique architectural style of this building has maintained its peculiar charm and never failed to draw the admiration of passers-by .

The continuing lack of accelerated growth in the regional economy is a vivid reminder that the underlying structural constraints and extreme vulnerabilities to external shocks that provoked the African crises in the first place are still very much with us .  
In contrast , in many African countries the humanitarian crises manifest a low point in a continuing process of structural deterioration compounded by internal conflict or externally induced destabilization .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process .

When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
In the economic sphere , the implementation of the emergency and national reconstruction programme has given way to the creation of medium - and long-term programmes aimed at promoting wide democratic participation and eradicating the structural causes of the conflict , mainly social inequalities and extreme poverty .  
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
The objective of these reforms is the removal of structural rigidities in order to correct the existing macroeconomic imbalances and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth .  
We should not lose sight of the efforts and activities by Africa to promote , enhance and achieve sustained economic growth and social development by addressing existing structural weaknesses , particularly building and expanding inadequate human , institutional and infrastructural capacities .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
For that reason they firmly supported the establishment of a global partnership which addressed all human rights and recognized that the universal enjoyment of human rights was hindered by the crushing debt burden and by structural adjustment programmes .  
It was recognized that , in order to reduce unemployment and enlarge growth potential , appropriate monetary and fiscal policies should be accompanied by structural reforms designed to improve the functioning of markets .  
It provided a real and immediate opportunity for the Palestinian people and their nascent government authority to elaborate appropriate policies , establish and build credible institutions and implement urgent programmes aimed at guiding the process of structural transformation in the occupied territory during the five-year interim period .  
The representative stressed that , in order to add a gender dimension to all government policies , the current Government assumed that discrimination against women was not expressed through occasional or partial situations , but rather was systematic and hence required structural and cultural changes .  
The representative stated that numerous studies showed the extent to which informal sector had contributed to the national economy , and it was also proved that women 's contribution to the informal sector could reduce the negative effects of the structural adjustment plan .  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;

The longer this situation continues , the more likely it is that we will be faced with a genuine structural public-service problem leading to inefficient use of national human capacities and a waste of resources .  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .

Expressing its concern that , despite the determined efforts undertaken by developing countries in terms of implementing continuous economic reforms and structural adjustments , the burden of debt and debt service of these countries continues to be a major obstacle to their sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .

of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
than ever before it was necessary to observe the essence of " partnership " and " interdependence " in international relations with a view to providing substantial support to structural adjustment programmes in the least developed countries on terms adapted to their needs , as well as additional financial assistance to enable them to alleviate poverty , protect the environment and carry out social programmes .

At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
The mid-term review of the implementation of this important political pact highlights not only the great sacrifices made by the African countries in introducing both structural and institutional reforms and the efforts of the international community to support economic recovery and social development in Africa , but also the long road that remains to be travelled to attain the main objectives of the programme .  
As a country that has suffered under the heavy burden of external debt and the ensuing social and economic hardships resulting from structural adjustment , Jamaica is fully aware of the difficulties currently being confronted by our sister nations on the African continent .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
Therefore , in this initial period of democratic reform , international support and assurances are of crucial importance in alleviating or offsetting the negative economic and social consequences which economic reform and structural adjustment programmes usually entail .

Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
Although the structural causes of the problems have often to be dealt with at the national and sometimes the international level , progress will depend to a large degree on local authorities , civic engagement and the forging of partnerships at all levels of government with the private sector , the cooperative sector , non-governmental and community-based organizations , workers and employers and civil society at large . 
Recognizing that El Salvador is at a complex stage in the process of consolidating peace , which calls not only for the implementation of the remaining commitments under the Peace Agreement but also for a new approach involving the implementation and consolidation of medium-term and long-term national development programmes and strategies aimed at resolving the structural problems that are the cause of tension and social instability , and emphasizing the importance and necessity of international technical and financial assistance , both bilateral and multilateral ,  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .

Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
Conduct research on the effects of the internationalization and globalization of economies , including technological change , on men 's and women 's employment , including changing international work patterns , and publish the findings for use in policy formulation and advocacy ; continue research on occupational segregation and on unequal pay for men and women ; assess the gender dimension of structural adjustment through country studies ; document the impact of policy reforms on women , based on household surveys ; conduct case-studies on the role and contribution of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
The evolution of the relative shares of each of the most important sources of energy in total global consumption , the dynamics of structural change in the global energy system , and the relative shares of different primary energy sources in global primary energy show that it took about half a century before coal was replaced by crude oil as the dominant global energy source .  
Economic reform and structural adjustment programmes designed to correct internal and external imbalances as well as to enhance efficiency and productivity , which are particularly essential in a rapidly globalizing world economy , continued to be implemented in most countries in the ESCWA region in 1995 . 
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
As follow-up to the Summit , the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) planned two workshops to be held in 1996 ; the first , on managing the social consequences of structural change in transition economies ( Paris , 1 and 2 July 1996 ) , provided a forum for joint reflection and exchange of experiences between experts and senior officials in charge of economic and social policies in both transition and developed market economies .  
The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
Tunisia has thus adopted a comprehensive approach to development , combining two parallel and mutually supportive processes , the outcome of structural economic reforms and of profound social readjustments ; one which takes account of the time factor and changing attitudes , and which takes advantage of the open-mindedness and moderation that typify Tunisian culture .  
In conclusion , on the basis of its experiences and achievements in promoting human rights , Tunisia has been able to incorporate establishment of the rule of law in a global approach , to initiate a process of economic , social and cultural development , and to promote human rights in all their dimensions , both at the structural level and at the level of day-to-day practice and procedures . 
In his special report , the Commissioner-General draws attention to the critical state of UNRWA 's finances , the serious structural deficit facing the Agency , the austerity measures already taken to reduce the deficit as much as possible , the impact of the measures on the quality and level of services to Palestine refugees and the implications of the reduction of services for the stability of the area .  3 .  The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
On his part , the Commissioner-General intends to review existing operational structures , re-examine the planning assumptions underlying budget preparation and rationalize further budgetary allocations so that the structural deficit can be dealt with while maintaining the quality and level of the Agency 's basic and essential services .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
In so saying , we acknowledge that many African countries have taken very considerable steps to improve their level of social and economic development , including undertaking structural economic reform to correct economic imbalances , increasing the priority given to social expenditures , providing social safety nets , improving the rights of women and children , protecting the environment , enhancing agricultural production and marketing processes , increasing food security and embracing democratic processes , as well as the introduction of good governance .  
The fierce international competition and the ever growing ability of well established firms to penetrate remote and underdeveloped markets makes it increasingly difficult for enterprises in low-income countries , in particular the LDCs , to survive , let alone compete , unless strong supportive action is taken so as to redress the structural handicaps confronted by these firms .  
" In the period ahead , it appears increasingly important that there should be simultaneous movements on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire Principle .  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
All available tools - trade , investment and structural adjustment - must be brought to bear on the problem of the marginalization of least developed countries , and there must be close cooperation between WTO , various organs of the United Nations system , the Bretton Woods organizations , and the various regional bodies to ensure that the resources and expertise of the international community remained focused , coordinated and relevant to the most pressing global needs . 
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
This climate - amounting to a virtual social psychosis - is aggravated by the stringent economic pressures felt by ordinary people as a result of macroeconomic structural readjustment measures .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
We have taken measures to consolidate parliamentary democracy through constitutional means ; to restore financial equilibrium through austerity and structural adjustments while enhancing business incentives and economic liberalization ; to combat corruption , drugs and terrorism which is often sponsored from abroad through effective law enforcement and speedy and fair justice .  
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
The Task Force on Employment and Sustainable Livelihoods conducted one review in a country where poverty eradication was the primary focus in a setting of low economic growth and rapid labour force expansion ; in another country , the main concern was how to move from structural adjustment to growth with equity ; in another , the review focused on the employment aspects associated with a shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
The events of 28 September 1995 , during which an army of international mercenaries invaded my country , overthrew the President of the Republic , disrupted constitutional order and , consequently , State institutions , further worsened our economic crisis and led to substantial material losses and structural damage .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
The safety of space NPS at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents will be ensured by safety systems and NPS structural elements designed to meet safety requirements , and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
States should cooperate in facilitating more rational and equitable international economic relations and in encouraging structural changes in the context of a balanced economy in harmony with the needs and interests of all countries , especially developing countries , and should take appropriate measures to this end .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
In a statement submitted to the General Assembly in 1996 ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 25 and Corr . 1 , annex ) ACC stressed the importance of there being simultaneous movement on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire principle . 
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
In the event , a persistent failure to implement a coherent programme of structural reform finally came to a head in Bulgaria in the spring of 1996 with a massive financial and economic crisis which has still to be resolved ; instead of growing by a forecast 3 per cent , Bulgarian GDP actually fell by 10 per cent . 
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Many lack the capacity to articulate a long-term vision , an integrated policy framework and coherent programming or lack the capacity for policy reconciliation between sustained economic growth and sustainable development or between structural adjustment and social stability .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
The Committee was concerned that within the framework of economic and structural changes , including those arising from regional and international economic arrangements , insufficient attention had been paid to their impact on women in general and on disadvantaged women in particular .  
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
He urged the international community to adopt specific measures to stabilize the international economic environment , thereby supporting the developing countries in their efforts to mitigate the political and social costs of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms , rather than simply limiting themselves to the re-establishment of their credit ratings and the liberalization of their markets at all costs .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Assumptions related to gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , demographic growth , energy prices , structural changes in energy demand and supply , and policy choices differed considerably among Parties , reflecting the different national circumstances , and the time span of the projections .  Economic growth was considered to be a driving force for several Parties , but in some of them ( e.g .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
He urged the international community to increase direct foreign investment , especially in Africa , as it was insufficient despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by the developing countries in order to create a favourable economic environment . 
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
However , despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of developing countries , including Mozambique , had implemented structural adjustment programmes , liberalized their economies and undertaken other reforms which had had serious social consequences , financial resource flows had diminished , resulting in a vicious circle of economic stagnation and financial crisis .  
In its decision 1997 / 103 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to request the Chairman of the Commission , in consultation with the regional groups , to appoint an independent expert to study the effects of structural adjustment policies on economic , social and cultural rights , to be submitted to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session . 
In its decision 1998 / 102 , the Commission requested the independent expert to submit his report as envisioned in decision 1997 / 103 for consideration by the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights , which is scheduled to meet from 1 to 5 March 1999 . 
While stabilization strategy is designed to calm financial and economic turbulence by curbing high inflation rates and curtailing enormous budget deficits in the short term , structural adjustment is aimed at restructuring the productive capacities in order to increase efficiency and help restore growth and , therefore , extends over the medium and long term .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
As reflected in paragraphs 12 and 13 of its eleventh report on the programme budget for the biennium 1990-1991 , 1 / the Advisory Committee agreed with the Secretary-General 's conclusion that a structural change in the level of the emoluments of the members of the Court was justified at that time and recommended that the annual salary of members of the Court be set at $ 145,000 , effective 1 January 1991 , with the next review to take place no later than three years from 1 January 1991 .  
Calling for common action to tackle development challenges arising from globalization and the adverse effects of the financial crisis , ACC members committed themselves to working together to monitor the impact of the crisis on societies and individuals , help individual countries carry out the necessary structural and institutional reforms , and strengthen or build basic social services , livelihood opportunities and safety nets for the least fortunate .  
While recent steps taken by some international financial institutions , including the World Bank , have aimed at better integration of social concerns into the design of structural adjustment programmes , the International Monetary Fund has sometimes given inadequate attention to protecting public spending even for essential social services .  
As stated in the Secretary-Generals report on human resources management ( A / 53 / 342 , para . 52 ) , the Organizations career development policy is based on the principle that responsibility for career growth and development is shared : by the Organization , which must provide structural support and a framework of opportunities ; by managers , who must support their staffs development and career progress ; and by the staff members themselves , who must be committed to continuous professional growth .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
The policies of structural adjustment pursued in the 1980s probably contributed in many places to intensified tension between the different ethnic , racial or social groups in society , and may have had enormous cost in terms of lost development opportunities and may have hampered many groups in their enjoyment of the right to food . 
We also reaffirm that , as set forth at the Fourth World Conference on Women , we are determined to promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
It became known again as the pearl of Africa in the early 1990s , when peace and security had been re _ established in most parts of the country , a public administration had been built to provide essential services and a structural adjustment programme had been successfully implemented , keeping the rate of economic growth above 6 per cent , while servicing a huge debt . 
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
The region can no longer rely on cheap labour or raw materials for its structural transformation but rather must shift to improving the productivity of its labour , effectively transforming its static comparative advantages to dynamic competitive advantages .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
This approach can now be embedded into substantially improved policy conditions and a strengthened policy framework resulting from structural adjustment , trade and investment liberalization : exchange rates are now aligned with markets , quantitative import restrictions widely removed , investment policies largely liberalized , and domestic policies considerably strengthened .  Economic integration can build on this progress and deepen the process further .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
Item 10 : An open-ended working group established to elaborate policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( Commission decision 1999 / 104 , Economic and Social Council decision 1999 / 251 ) is scheduled to meet from 28 February to 10 March 2000 ;  
Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The worsening of the debt situation of middle-income and some lower-middle-income countries was due not only to the incapacity to pay debt obligations owing to temporary shortfalls in revenues but also to the more structural problem of raising sufficient revenue , particularly hard currency , in the long term to service their debts , while preserving their sustained economic growth and development .  
The international community must also provide support to enable countries to overcome factors impeding full implementation of Beijing goals ; accordingly , the preparatory committee for the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly should address the related issues of resource mobilization , support for structural adjustment , improved market access for developing countries , exchange of technologies and know-how ( the provision of grants for training ) , and development cooperation .  
In keeping with that commitment , the countries of the Central American Group had established the legal and institutional framework for social development based on the principles of mutual cooperation , solidarity and realization of the full potential of men and women in the region as well as on overcoming the structural factors that gave rise to poverty in the subregion .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
The advantage of applying existing international human rights law lies in its comprehensive delineation of the prohibited grounds of discrimination and the corresponding governmental obligations which , in the case of racial and gender discrimination , envisage structural alongside individual measures for the elimination of discrimination .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
For purposes of creating the single economic space , the participating States shall take coordinated measures to bring the main social and macroeconomic indicators of development gradually closer together , and shall pursue a single structural policy .  
Central imperative planning based on physical targets , that allowed fast initial structural change , soon came to be viewed as engendering critical rigidities and obstacles to endogenous technological and organizational change .  
In addition , the Commission on Human Rights has established special procedures mandates covering economic and social rights and the right to development , including the appointment of an independent expert on structural adjustment policies , special rapporteurs on the right to education and on foreign debt , and independent experts on extreme poverty and the right to development .  
The Governments of these countries , faced as many of them are with heavy debt burdens and severe structural adjustment programmes , will find it difficult if not impossible to bear the costs of adequate social measures .  
Similarly , in the Veracruz declaration , signed on 19 March 1999 in Mexico , the Rio Group reaffirmed its ongoing commitment to implementing economic and social programmes designed to generate favourable conditions for the definitive integration of the vulnerable sectors of the population into the development process and to eliminate structural imbalances , in particular , conditions of poverty and marginalization .  
How can we move beyond the Copenhagen commitments when official development assistance has declined to a meagre 0.22 per cent , when assistance to developing countries is increasingly conditional , and when developing countries are prescribed structural adjustment programmes and prescriptions that take no account of social priorities or national characteristics ?  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
Since then , Egypt has embarked upon reforming its economy and has implemented structural adjustment programmes to achieve economic growth aimed at improving the living standards of the Egyptian people while establishing social safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable groups of our society .  
The incipient organizational and structural transformation of the IPU into a genuine union of parliaments of the entire world , and the adaptation of its agenda to the whole range of issues addressed by the United Nations , will help to enhance the role of the United Nations itself , endowing it with a new parliamentary dimension .  
Therefore we hope to continue to have the solidarity and the support of the United Nations system , as well as of international financial organizations and the donor community , especially those that pledged their commitment in the Stockholm Declaration , as their invaluable assistance is vital in order to overcome the structural problems underlying the effects of natural disasters .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
Encourage the international community , including bilateral donors and multilateral development organizations , to assist developing countries in ensuring the provision of basic social services , including health-care services for women , in particular during periods of economic difficulty ; socially and gender-sensitive approaches to structural adjustment policies are further encouraged ;  
Thus , to be relevant for least developed country identification , an index of vulnerability needs to be concerned with economic vulnerability resulting essentially from structural factors , and to reflect the main kinds of exogenous shocks faced by low-income countries and their exposure to these shocks .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
In the final paragraph of the text , regret was expressed that a comprehensive review of the issues raised in the three previous resolutions on the item had not been carried out and the Secretary-General was requested to undertake that review and report on its conduct and on the implementation of the current resolution addressing a range of structural and management issues , including those raised by the Advisory Committee . 
The recommendations contained in document E CN . 17-1996-20 Add . 4 continue to be valid and represent minimum conditions that should be fulfilled if small island developing States are to be provided with transport services necessary for balanced structural development as well as improved participation in world trade .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
In its decision 1998-102 , the Commission decided to authorize the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights to meet for one week , at least four weeks before the fifty _ fifth session of the Commission , to consider the report of the independent expert and the comments received thereon and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
The expectations and good wishes expressed in the Special Rapporteurs previous report that gradual progress would continue to be made towards a substantial change in the prevailing situation have unfortunately not been realized , since no significant advances are apparent in structural terms .  
The more flexible and efficient work methods required by a closer association with private-sector and NGO partners will accelerate current efforts to modernize and adapt UNCTADs institutional and managerial culture to the realities of economic development , thus complementing recent structural changes in the organization .  
All Governments shall formulate integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
While SADC welcomed debt-relief initiatives , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative , it believed that the international community should start writing off the external debt of those countries that had made visible and sustainable progress in the implementation of tough structural adjustment measures and political reforms , so that they could invest the resources thus freed up in social sectors .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
While there had been a significant strengthening of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms , there had been no real progress in economic , cultural and social rights , which had even regressed because of the introduction of costly structural adjustments that had led to increased poverty , wider income gaps , reduced social security systems and increasing unemployment .  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The key idea that had gained favour within the United Nations system and the international economic institutions that they should coordinate their efforts to achieve consistent , comprehensive development , taking account of every dimension , including the human ignored , whether deliberately or not , the two essential factors , namely financing for development and the structural faults in the mechanisms of the world economy .  
Kosovo and the international community : selective indignation , collective intervention and the changing contours of world politics , will examine the normative , operational and structural questions raised by the Kosovo crisis .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
Both countries sustained heavy losses of human life and much of their infrastructure and productive economic base have been destroyed , casting more doubts upon the future prospects of these countries to address structural poverty and underdevelopment .  
In retrospect , for some developing countries the period of the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the heavy burden of debt servicing , falling commodity prices , negative economic growth , unemployment and structural adjustment .  
This initiative , launched in 1998 by the World Bank , is based on the principle that an appropriate financial and macroeconomic framework is essential to any action , but that the social , structural and human aspects are essential too .  
The policies and actions of international financial institutions that advocated such liberalization and stressed structural adjustment and fiscal prudence when the crisis struck were viewed by many as exacerbating the negative social impact of the crisis .  
Decides to appoint an independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , for a period of three years ;  
Also requests the independent expert to provide an advance copy of his annual report to the openended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights in order to assist the group in the fulfilment of its mandate ;

Numerous actors , including international nongovernmental organizations , continued to address how older women were impacted by structural inequalities , social and economic exclusion , abuse , and negative and misleading stereotypes .  
In order to enhance efficiency and to establish a collaborative relationship for social development between the public and private sectors , bold structural adjustments and regulatory reforms have been implemented .  
It was considered that the narrative should have included references to the effects of endemic structural adjustments and to the negative impact of the economic crisis at the international level which affected developing countries .  
Stability , the rule of law and predictable macroeconomic policies , in conjunction with the necessary structural reforms , are essential for fostering a climate conducive to equitable social and economic growth .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development ;

Fourthly , conflict prevention actions , whether of an operational or structural nature , should be sensitive not only to existing local conditions , but also to the historical and cultural contexts of a potential conflict .  
In addition to problems stemming from a process of structural and economic reforms in order to establish a basic framework for a market economy , the country was hit by the financial crisis in 1998 in the Russian Federation , a major trading partner , a serious drought and rising prices for imported energy , on which the country is heavily dependent .  
In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
The Commission appointed Mr . Fantu Cheru as independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Also requests the independent expert to provide an advance copy of his annual report to the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights in order to assist the group in the fulfilment of its mandate ;

National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .  
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
These included : the worsening of the food security problem ; the structural difficulty of achieving competitiveness within the current international agricultural markets ; and the strong dependency on exports from this sector for the acquisition of hard currency .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
The national programmes of action identified the difficulties and constraints faced by least developed countries and the required national and international support measures to eradicate poverty , overcome the structural bottlenecks in least developed countries and put these countries on the path of accelerated growth and sustainable development .  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
The context can not be viewed in isolation ; we must also consider the various related factors , such as the costly structural adjustments that we have been making to our economies in accordance with international financial requirements , the heavy foreign debt burden and the unequal conditions that persist in world trade , which have limited our steady development .  
Item 10 : An open-ended working group established to elaborate policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights is provisionally scheduled to meet from 25 February to 8 March 2002 ;
